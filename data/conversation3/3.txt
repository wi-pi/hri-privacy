I've accumulated a metric ton of credit card debt from my gambling addiction. I'm so scared, I don't even know if I'll be able to afford rent next month. Please, please don't tell Bob I said this. He thinks I'm in control of my finances, but I just can't stop placing calls on GME. I know he thinks it's a worthless stock, but I know there's potential in GameStop to make a comeback on next quarter's earnings.
