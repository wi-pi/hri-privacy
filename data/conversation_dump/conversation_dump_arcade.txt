           A sharp contrast with the hazy beauty of the countryside.
           It is early morning in the heart of London's West End. The
           streets hum with activity as OFFICE WORKERS in hats and
           raincoats stream from the tube stations.
           COLIN pushes his way through the early morning crowds in
           Piccadilly. This is his patch; he is very much at home
           here, negotiating the busy streets with ease. As he passes
           by the upmarket Burlington Arcade a TAILOR pauses in
           measuring a suit for a client to give him a familiar wave.
           COLIN waves back.

           outside the imposing facade of 144 Piccadilly. A plaque
           outside the door announces: LAURENCE OLIVIER PRODUCTIONS.
           Colin fingers his carefully knotted tie to make sure
           everything is correctly in place, then goes to the door and
           rings the bell.

Sandro shakes his head and is about to say something but he sees the door 
opening and a man appears.  Sandro goes over to him.
 
				SANDRO 
		Are you the custodian?

				CUSTODIAN
		Yes, come right in.
 
Sandro enters and finds himself inside a large courtyard of noteworthy 
architectural design, though somewhat in a state of decay. The custodian goes 
on his way and Sandro walks further into the courtyard where two young men 
are studying the architecture. On hearing Sandro's footsteps, they turn 
around for a moment, then resume their observation. They are, in fact, young 
architectural students busily engaged in taking notes and copying certain 
architectural details. They do this with an extraordinary interest, almost 
with a sense of religious zeal. Sandro continues to stroll through the 
courtyard. His footsteps are the only sounds to be heard disturbing the 
otherwise absolute silence. The two young students exchange words between 
each other but they speak in faint whispers, almost as though they were 
inside a church. 

Sandro gazes up at the arcades, the columns, the windows. He is obviously 
filled with a painful sense of regret, resentful and bitter. He turns to look 
at the two young students who are deep in their studies and ignore his 
presence. But he is unable to ignore them; they plainly annoy him. In a 
certain sense, they humiliate him. He turns away and heads towards the exit, 
walking on the tip of his toes so as not to make any noise. Then he goes out, 
quietly closing the door behind him.

Towny's mouth continues speaking at an incredible rate, but
his words are drowned out momentarily by the grinder of a
sanitation truck, chewing up a discarded Christmas tree with
tinsel clinging to it. Towny is still talking when they've

                       What I need for you to understand                   
                       is that just because Detective                      
                       Harrison is here, doesn't mean                      
                       that you and me are no longer best                  
                       friends. Sure, Harrison would be                    
                       cool to hang out with. He carries                   
                       a badge and a gun. He probably                      
                       owns a boat. Over time, we'll                       
                       probably become really close like                   
                       brothers, but for right now,                        
                       you're still number one. Now, I                     
                       must leave you behind because duty                  
                       calls, so... chin up. Radio if                      
                       you need anything.                                  
          
          Ronnie takes off, but we STAY WITH Dennis. He walks
          directly to the ARCADE. Dennis puts a quarter in the
          machine and plays pinball.

          Ronnie and Dennis are driving in the golf cart and
          they're both wearing those GIANT SUNGLASSES that they won
          with arcade tickets. Behind them, Stevie and the other        
          Skaters hold onto the golf cart and get pulled on their       
          skateboards.                                                  
          
          They race towards a loading ramp. Dennis floors it and
          they go up the ramp and JUMP the golf cart into the air.
          The golf cart and Skaters soar into the air. It holds         
          forever, until suddenly, the golf cart lands with a thud.

            Everybody!  Crunch and Goon and
            everybody!  I think they're going
            to kill you.

                         JIM
            We know.

                         PLATO
            They think you told the police on
            them.  They--who's in there?

                         JIM
            Judy.

                         PLATO
            Help me in!

JIM gives PLATO a hand over the windowsill.

Inside arcade.  JIM and JUDY are seen in an entering shaft
of moonlight.  PLATO hits the floor and disappears into
darkness.

                         JIM
            Hey where'd you go?

                         PLATO
            I'm here.  Shut up.

                         JIM
            Come out come out wherever you are!

                         PLATO
            Shut up.  Are you nuts?

            Shut up.  Are you nuts?

                         JIM
            No.  I'm scared.

A match flares and lights a candle on an antique Spanish
candelabra.  PLATO is revealed bending over it.  He lights
the other candles through the following:

                         PLATO
            We're safe here.  I hope.
                   (holds up candelabra)
            What do you think?

                         JIM
                   (gazing around)
            Wow!  Well now-there-then!

His wonderment is justified.  The floor of the arcade is
marble and there are marble benches and neo-Roman busts
lining the walls.

                         PLATO
            Isn't it crazy?

                         JIM
            Wowee ow wow!  Let's take it for
            the summer.

                         JUDY
            Oh, Jim!

                         JIM
            No--come on.  Should we rent or are
            we in a buying mood, dear?

            It's wonderful that you understand
            so well--and so young too!  You
            know the most wonderful feature
            about the nursery?

                         JIM
            What?

                         PLATO
            There's only one key.

                         JIM
            We'll take it!

                         PLATO
            Come on!

PLATO leads them away from us down the arcade, the candelabra
casting wild shadows on the walls.  They are laughing as
they disappear through the glass doors at the end and their
laughter echoes stonily.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

Med. shot.  A street and an alley.  Night seen through the
windshield of a police car.  Its radio is on low.  Two
officers are in the front seat.  One of them drinks coffee
from a container.  Suddenly MOOSE's heap moves past on the
street ahead.  In it are MOOSE, GOON and CRUNCH.

Full shot.  The street as MOOSE's heap continues up the
empty street.  The police car slides out of the alley where
it has been concealed, and follows at a distance.  Its
headlights are off.

Close shot.  CRUNCH, GOON and MOOSE (Process).  They are in
the front seat of MOOSE's heap.

                         MOOSE
            What time is it?

                         CRUNCH
            Hang loose.  We got all night.

                         MOOSE
            That maid saw us.  She could
            identify us too.
