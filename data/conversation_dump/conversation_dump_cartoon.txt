          Spilling the drinks all over him. Rod falls back knocking
          the table down. His friends jump up to his aid. Our guys
          are surrounded. The only opening is the cafeteria line.
          Mike is hit and falls back knocking down a tail row of plates,
          saucers, cups. Cyril is swinging the bowling ball around
          himself for protection. More rows of plates fall as the
          ball hits-them. The College Guys, led by Rod are trying to
          advance but our guys are throwing plates and maybe even food
          at them. The College Guys are throwing back what they can.
          Cyril's ball flies off and hits somebody in the stomach.
          By now its a free-for-all.

                    FREDA
          Seriously? It's not a big deal --
          just take a little hit.

Kate and Freda stare at each other. A stand-off.

                       KATE
          I said no.

                    FREDA
          One hit won't hurt you. It'll sober
          you up.

Kate glances at the pipe, which Freda wiggles in front of
her.

              (high-pitched cartoon

Kate LAUGHS.

              One puff. Then we are both going
              home.

    Freda nods. Long beat.

                        KATE (CONT'D)
              Fine.

    Freda puts the pipe into Kate's lips and lights it. Kate
    sucks in crack smoke. Her eyelids flutter.

              You've got money, right?

           Up there. They stop.
          Neckbone takes the lead, walking up to the last boot print.
          They appear to vanish.

           Where the hell'd he go?

                          ELLIS
           I don't know.
          Neckbone turns and freezes. A MAN has appeared in the
          distance behind Ellis. He stands between the boys and their
          boat.
          Ellis notices the look on Neckbone's face and turns. He
          flinches at the sight of the Man.
          MUD(38) stands near the boys' boat holding a pink, child's
          fishing pole with cartoon characters on it. He stares back
          at them and casts his fishing line into the water.

                          NECKBONE

          Mud, not taking his eyes off the boys, slowly reels in his
          line. His hair is a wild mop that leads to two weeks of
          growth on his face.
          With a cigarette clinched, he cracks a smile revealing a
          MISSING CANINE. He holds a hand in the air as if to wave.

                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
           Shit.
          Neckbone slowly raises his hand up to wave back. Mud wears
          jeans and cowboy boots. His filthy button-up shirt looks
          like it hasn't left his body in years.
          He breaks his stare with the boys. Continuing to reel in his
          line, he walks over to them.

           This houseboat, although similar in size, is different than
           Ellis'. It's an actual wood shack that has been constructed
           atop a barge.
           Ellis looks at photos, books and memorabilia that cram the
           walls and shelves. It feels homey.
           Tom, his back to the boy, stands in the kitchen area pouring
           a cup of coffee.

          They seem happy. Another photo, late 60's, of Tom standing
          alone in a suit. He holds a LONG SUITCASE.
          Tom enters holding two cups of coffee.

                          TOM
           You don't have to lie to me boy.
          He hands Ellis a cup of coffee with a cartoon image of a dog
          on it. It reads, "I'm a real bitch in the morning!" Tom
          sits in a LazyBoy that he gently rocks in.

          Ellis nods. There is an awkward moment.

          The worst morning ever.
          
          Tom walks down the street. Or, more accurately, Tom sulks
          down the street. Though it's sunny and warm, Tom is a sad,
          broken man and the world is an awful place. There's still
          Hall and Oates following Tom, almost trying to cheer him up.
          He checks out his reflection in a window. Ron Howard's
          brother Clint looks back.
          
          Tom walks by a COUPLE making out on a bench. He grimaces.
          
          He walks by a sign that says "TODAY ONLY: FREE BEER." He
          doesn't even stop.
          
          Cartoon Bird returns but Tom swats it away.

    Oh no, ho -- these are great.

  A fair amount of tension.  These two people hardly know each
  other -- and the first and last time they met, they kissed.

    Sorry about not ringing back.  The
    whole two-names concept was totally too
    much for my flatman's pea-sized
    intellect.

    No, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I

		England cannot begin again.

	During this peroration, we see DISRAELI for the first time. 
	He is handsome, obviously Jewish and wire thin, like
	Dickens on Slimfast.  He dresses almost dandyishly but
	speaks with startling vigor; a combination of brilliance
	and cheek that is his key.  To cheers from his back
	benchers, he sits.

	As he looks up, he catches the eye of his opposite on the
	Liberal benches.  GLADSTONE is different in almost every
	respect; dour, dogged, heavy-set and tall.  They stare
	levelly for a second, then DISRAELI flashes a brilliant
	smile.

		The cartoon or Her Majesty's

		Well, both.

		Surely, you're not suggesting we

           for a governess, an educatress. No.
           It would just ruin it.
          Walt is baffled. He takes a sip of tea, it's disgusting, he
          spits it back into his cup surreptitiously, then coughs
          loudly. Pamela's jaw drops.

           I won't have her turned into one of

          awake. Staring into the darkness.
          Pamela checks through her multitude of pill bottles for
          something to help her. Nothing. She groans as she drags

           Serves me right. Money, money,

          Her eyes stray to the big Mickey Mouse. She drags it onto the

          the requisite abundance of brightly coloured food now
          accompanied by some healthier options - vegetables and a
          fluorescent looking soup.
          Bob and Dick are at the piano. Don sits in the corner,
          sketching energetically on his notepad what seems to be a
          cartoon sketch of Pamela Travers.
