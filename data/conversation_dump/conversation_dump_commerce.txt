INT./ EXT.  ROMAN STREETS - SLAVE WAGON - NIGHT

Maximus cranes for a sight of the Eternal City through a
hole in the wooden slats that cover the slave cart.

He can see only glimpses of Rome as they pass.  But the
images are not what he expected.  Alongside the undeniable
glory of the city, the madness and disease Marcus Aurelius
spoke of are readily apparent.

Maximus sees flashes of plague victims being tossed on
carts heaped with bodies -- he sees getting and spending
and commerce everywhere -- he sees fascist Praetorian
Guard units trooping past -- he sees the magnificent
architecture of the city -- he sees starving children

             In order to ensure that we weren't going
             to welch, Ashby's pay-off was to be
             directly deposited into his own offshore
             account which he could confirm
             electronically. In this age of
             ecommerce, paper currency has become "
             more of a liability than a commodity.
             Especially to us.

          it's about responsibility...
          Hancock reaches into the cabinet below the sink - pulls out a
          BOTTLE of 409 all-purpose cleaner...
          On the tube, the commercial segues way into...

          stronghold...
          The SOUND of machine guns CRACKLE amidst mortar explosions and
          civil destruction.
          Hancock listens - it disturbs him. He whirls around, accosts the
          TV Rips it from the wall, throws it out the window. And a CRASH
          eradicates images of war and chaos.
          He returns to the bathroom. To the mirror. Proceeds to spray his

          EMPORIUM.
          From the street, notice the display windows - all mannequins
          come complete with outfit and ultra-erect nipples.
          As EMPLOYEES file into the service entrance, out comes Horus and
          Roheim. They head streetward, to the sidewalk.
          Roheim unscrews the battery cap from his flashlight. Takes a
          swig from its hollow interior.

          ROHEIM
          I'll just play out the rest of this Eight

          The bank floor in shambles. No one in sight. But movement jars

          We SEE Hancock wade through rubble towards the open safe, a

		Gentlemen, celebration is premature.
		We have a difficult campaign ahead

		hostile country and we cannot rely

EXT.  COMMERCE STREET - LAWSON, CALIFORNIA - DAY

Pete and Stanton walk along Commerce Street, the main drag
through the center of the small town.  Lawson is a bit run
down, creeping inexorably toward decrepit.  Despite that,
there's a timeless quality to the small buildings, a familiar
All-American feel.

Several of the PEOPLE walking along the street take notice of
Pete and nod to Stanton, who nods back.

                    PETE
          They all know you?

                    STANTON
          'Course they all know me.  And I
          know all them.  Town's got my name,
          don't it?

They pass the window of the drug store, COLE'S PHARMACY. 
Pete looks down and sees

TWO FADED GOLD STARS

in the window with two faded photos, all decked in tattered
black crepe.  Two boys, no more than 18 and 19, who went off
to war and didn't come back.

Stanton notes Pete stopping to look at the stars and photos.

A stoop-shouldered little man in his late 60s, HARRY TRUMBO
shambles along the street, headed for Mabel's Diner.  There's
a sadness about Harry, the world-weary melancholy of a man
who has little to smile about because he has little to care
about.  After a couple of steps, he's met up by DOC BEN
LARDNER, a vigorous man in his 50s.  He comes up behind Harry
and claps him on the back.

          eye.  But it's probably temporary. 
          He got all the way to Lawson, so he
          clearly knew who he was and what he
          was doing until he hit his head. 
          I'm sure it'll all come back to

Ernie runs across the street and, slightly winded, stands

taps Ernie on the shoulder.

		80,000 kills a year.  Cocaine manages 
		a measly 2,000.  Same for Heroin.  
		But, the big daddy is Big Tobacco

congratulations along the way, arrives at the podium.

                       MR. BROOKS
             Thank you all very much. The first
             thing I would like to say is... I
             don't even know how I cut my toe
             nails.

Applause and laughter from the Audience.

                       MR. BROOKS
             Twenty years ago when I started the
             Brooks Box Factory I never dreamed
             I would one day be standing here.

                    hasn't decided on the structure

                    important than the man chosen to
                    run it.

73 INT. DON WHISKERANDOS BARBER SHOP DAY

As Don Whiskerandos' hand, holding a razor, travels over the great plains
of Monk Eastman's face. His hand is shaking.

MONK EASTMAN
What's the trouble, Don?

DON WHISKERANDOS
There's someone here.

Monk bestirs himself in the chair, SEES: Bill the Butcher, standing in the
doorway.

MONK EASTMAN
It's just a man of commerce.

Monk settles back in the chair as Bill the Butcher walks into the shop.

BILL THE BUTCHER
You're right enough this time, Monk.
(to Don Whiskerandos)
Go ahead.
(the barber hesitates)
Go on with your work. I'll finish my business.

Don Whiskerandos picks up a pair of SCISSORS and NERVOUSLY starts to TRIM
Monk's hair.

MONK EASTMAN
Come out with it then.

Bill NODS emphatically at Don Whiskerandos, who is clearly terrified. Bill
nods again, almost vehemently. Don Whiskerandos SHAKES his head. Bill
GLARES at him. The Barber takes a STEP BACK. Monk opens his eyes, starts
to size up the situation.

BILL THE BUTCHER
You damn craven, do it!

Bill LEAPS forward, grabs the trembling barber's arm and pushes it toward
MONK...
