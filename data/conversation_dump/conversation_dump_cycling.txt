from his window as the vehicles pass: streetlights show two

          getting wet. He looks tired. He's thinking of the Italians.
          As he turns his legs we see: THE PICTURE OF THE ITALIANS

          FROM THE COMPETITIVE CYCLING MAGAZINE: FOUR OF THEM, ARMS
          AROUND EACH OTHER, SMILING. Then we see another picture,
          Dave is in the middle of the Italians. He has his arms

          He passes just under the door frame and comes down, feet

          Lacey's lingerie.
          Nick starts dancing, doing a strip tease for himself. WE PAN
          AROUND the room, and when we reach Nick again, he's wearing
          nothing but a pair of Lacey's thongs.
          He models in front of the mirror, regarding his bulging T.E.
          He removes a C-cup bra and holds it high. He uses the elastic
          straps to fasten the bra onto his head.
          He starts dancing up a storm to the cheesy Vengaboys

          As he backs up we can see that George is watching him from
          the doorway, a Safeway bag in his arms. Lacey peers over his
          shoulder. The MUSIC halts abruptly.

On a promontory jutting into Loch Ness stand the remains

the ruins of the East wall, wooden scaffolding has been
erected, and a couple of dozen men are engaged in what
appears to be repair work. Amidst the rubble of the
Nether Bailey, an encampment of tents has been set up.

Holmes, Gabrielle and Watson come bicycling up along a
fence on the heights overlooking the castle, dismount in
front of the locked gates. Attached to the gatepost is a
sign reading: WARNING: No Unauthorized Person Permitted

          INT. HANNA'S ROOM. EVE
          
          The room is simple, a bedroom to one side, a bathroom to the
          other. It is all furnished with simple functional furniture.
          The end of a hard day's work. MICHAEL hangs a picture over
          the desk - a landscape, reminiscent of where they once went
          cycling. The job is done. He looks round, grimly content.
          
          INT. CELL. DAWN
          
          HANNA is lying on her bed, fully dressed. She gets up and
          gets some books down from the shelf. She puts them, one by
          one, in a pile on the table. Then she takes off her shoes.
          She stands up and climbs onto the pile of books on the table.
          Her bare feet on the books. Then she reaches up.

116   EXT. STREET IN OXFORD. DAY                                 116

      Eighteen months later. Swelling orchestral music. Close on        
      Jenny cycling, absorbed, happy, the cello strapped to her
      precariously. The camera pulls back to show her cycling
      through the streets of Oxford. She's done it. We follow her
      for a little while. She dismounts outside a church and
      leans the bike against a wall. Just as she's about to leave
      it, she sees something and freezes. We follow her gaze:
      it's the red Bristol, parked a little way down the road
      just in front of her. She scans the street to see if she
      can find David. She can - he's coming round a corner, a           
      littler further down the street, unwrapping a packet of           
      cigarettes. Jenny moves into his eye-line. He sees her,           
      stops, then walks towards her.

                                                    115.

Jenny looks at him disbelievingly.
