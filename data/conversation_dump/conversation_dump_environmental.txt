			   (to D'Astier)
		Mr. President, would allow me to
		introduce Sydney Ellen Wade of the
		Commonwealth of Virginia. Sydney,
		this is President Rene-Jean D'Astier
		and his wife Monique Danielle
		D'Astier of France.

				LEO
		Yeah, it is, Sydney.

				SYDNEY
		You wanna tell me how my personal
		life in any way--

				LEO
		Because when it's the President, it's
		not personal. Sydney, I hired your
		reputation. I hired a pit bull, not
		a prom queen.

				SYDNEY
		That's unfair.

				LEO
		It's incredibly unfair. But you've
		spent a lot of time over the year
		telling me the trouble with the
		environmental lobby is that we don't
		understand the fundamental truth that
		politics is perception. This is a
		bad time to develop ignorance.

				SYDNEY
		You're making way too much of this.

				LEO
		Am I? This is your time, Sydney.
		You're sitting at the grown-ups'
		table. You have a chance to get
		everything you want -- run a national
		campaign, be a major player inside
		the party. But this relationship had
		better go all the way, because with
		the leader of the free world there is
		no halfway. Politics is perception,
		and if thing don't work out, the
		amount of time it'll take you to go
		from being a hired gun to a cocktail
		party joke can be clocked with an egg
		timer.

	There's a quick knock at the door -- Leo's SECRETARY steps in
	with a strange-looking package.

				SYDNEY
		Leo, there is no relationship. It
		was one night. It's done.

				LEO'S SECRETARY
		Mr. Solomon, this was just delivered
		by White House messenger. It's
		marked "Perishable."

		Richard Reynolds' campaign. He may
		be able to get me a job.

				SHEPHERD
		When did you decide to get a new job?

				SYDNEY
		Not long after Leo Solomon fired me
		from my old one. Beth's gonna kill
		me. She loves that--

				SHEPHERD
		Why did he fire you?

				SYDNEY
		Total failure to achieve any of the
		objectives for which I was hired. I
		told him he was being unreasonable.
		After all, I did get to dance with
		the President and ride in Air Force
		One a couple of times. But you know
		those prickly environmentalists.
		It's always gonna be something with
		them. If it's not clean air, then
		it's clean water. Like it isn't good
		enough that I'm on the cover of
		People Magazine.

				SHEPHERD
		I'll call him.

				SYDNEY
		You'll call him? You mean you'll
		call him yourself? Personally?
		It'll come from the President?
		That's a great idea. I think you
		should call Leo and make a deal. He
		hires me back for, say, 72 days. I
		go around scaring the hell out of
		Congress, making them think that the
		President's about to drive through a
		very damaging and costly bill.
		They'll believe me, right, 'cause I'm
		the President's Friday Night Girl.
		Now I don't know if you can dip into
		this well twice, especially since
		I've lost all credibility in politics,
		but you never know, I might just be
		able to pull it off again. I might
		be able to give you just the leverage
		you need to pass some ground-breaking
		piece of crime legislation -- like a
		mandatory three-day waiting period
		before a five-year-old can buy an Uzi.
		Fuck the sweater -- she'll have to
		learn to live with disappointment.

	She starts to exit

				SHEPHERD
		What do you think went on here today?

	She stops.

				SYDNEY
		I know exactly what went on here
		today. I got screwed. You saw the
		poll, you needed the crime bill,
		you couldn't get it on your own,
		so I got screwed.

          She raises money for this

          like a normal person. I can't live
          here alone in this house forever.
          I need something of significance in

          Why would you say that?

          Because you're always saying you
          don't know if women like you for
          who you are. You don't know if
          they like you because you have
          money or you're famous. Why not
          take some time and get to know them
          before ass-raping them. In a

          GEORGE
          That's insulting. Don't take out

          can't get laid by acting like I'm
          some sort of deviant. I'm an
          adult. I have adult sexual
          relationships. No one does what
          they don't want to do. Sex is how

          It is, because, fixing the

          enough of a war chest to sue local
          government and corporations so
          they're forced to observe the
