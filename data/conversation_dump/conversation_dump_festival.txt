          The more “out” you make us, the
          more you incite them. Step back and
          quiet down.

          HARVEY MILK
          Go back into the closet? Is that
          what you're saying? Because I know
          the closet. I lived in it for more
          years than I care to remember.
          (rising to go)
          I don't need your endorsement. I'm
          not asking anyone for acceptance.
          I don't have time to ask.

          For you, politics is a game, a
          lark. Like putting on a rock
          festival or staging a "love-in."
          You're too old to be a hippie,
          Harvey Milk!
          Harvey turns around, ready for a fight.

          I'm not a candidate, I'm part of a
          movement. The movement is the
          candidate. There's a difference. You
          don't see the difference. But I do.

          When the vote came in on election
          day... out of 32 candidates vying
          for 6 seats... We came in 10th.
          Just a handful short of being the
          first big eared, gay as a three-
          dollar-bill, cock sucker ever
          elected to public office.

Drama, Action, 
		I AM FATHER TO A MURDERED SON AND
		HUSBAND TO A MURDERED WIFE AND
		LANDLORD TO A MURDERED WORLD -- AND
		I WILL HAVE VENGEANCE!

The Praetorian Archers tense their bows -- ready to kill
the defiant slave --

But something extraordinary stops them.  Almost as one
being the crowd roars -- they leaps to their feet and
thrust their thumbs up!  They cheer and stomp their
approval of Maximus.

Commodus looks around at the people of Rome, amazed.

He finally plasters on a benevolent smile and thrusts his
thumb up!  The Praetorians lower their bows.

And the crowd cheers.  Never in the long, long history of
the Colosseum have they ever seen such a thing.

Maximus leads his gladiators out of the arena.

INT.  PALACE - THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

To our great surprise, Commodus is not raging.  He sits
quietly on the polished marble floor in front of a model
of the Colosseum.  He moves model pieces around in the
Colosseum, planning his festival.

Lucilla stands, tense.

					COMMODUS
		Why is he still alive?

					LUCILLA
		I don't know.

					COMMODUS
		He shouldn't be alive.  That vexes
		me.  I am terribly vexed...

Lucilla watches her brother cautiously, expecting the
explosion.  He carefully moves some model pieces in the
arena.

					COMMODUS
		There, that's better.  Do you like
		the platform here?

Maximus goes.  Vibius thinks about it, listening to the

The drums continue...

INT./ EXT.  SLAVE WAGON - ROMAN STREETS - DAY

Maximus and the other gladiators are in a slave cart on
the way from the arena.  A gang of children run alongside
the cart, cheering and chanting:

					KIDS
		Maximus the Merciful!  Maximus the
		Merciful!

The drums continue...

INT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - CELL - NIGHT

Maximus and Juba are with Lucilla and Gracchus.  Lucilla
is writing on a piece of parchment.

					MAXIMUS
		Tell him we will enter Rome on the
		first day of Commodus' festival.

					LUCILLA
		And they will march on Rome for you?

					MAXIMUS
		Yes.  But this letter must go to the
		lieutenant named Titus, no one else.

					LUCILLA
		Captain Marcellus will take it.  And
		his City Guard will by with you when
		you get to Rome.  Is that enough to
		face the Praetorian Guard?

					MAXIMUS

		The Felix Regiment will never be

               Good idea. Take a break. Not too

SHOUTING for REVELERS to move aside.

Asher running. Gun in his pocket. Elbowing his way

ahead.
Asher shoves his hand in his pocket...

BOOM!   BOOM-BOOM!     POP-POP-POP!

Thunderous GUNFIRE. Grace hits the deck. The Uniforms
hit the deck. The CROWD SCREAMS, CLAPS and WHISTLES.
It's not gunfire...

TILT UP.

FIREWORKS unfold in the night sky like giant flowers of
fire. Rivers of sparks.
Grace recovers her feet with palpable relief, she thought
she was dead for a second. Grace looking around for
Asher. Laval reaches her.

             Evidence at the Ford crime scene
             led to an apartment with more of
             Hart's DNA. And evidence linking
             Hart to Asher's crimes. Hart
             never set food in that apartment.
             Asher staged everything.

Grace chasing Hart.

                           SENIOR AGENT (V.O.)

             Mr. Hart, not Asher, murdered the
             Montreal Inspector, correct?

                           GRACE (V.O.)

             Yes. Hart thought Costa was
             systematically destroying his
             life. Hart's violent explosion
             was inevitable.

                           SENIOR AGENT (V.O.)

             How could Asher plan on Hart
             snapping like that?

                           GRACE (V.O.)

             He couldn't. My guess is Asher
             intended to kill Hart and make it
             look like suicide. The
             authorities would find the body
             and close the Martin Asher file.

  applauds and embraces.

Max points at his trumpet, continues playing.

         Please.
Max indicates his pocket. Manooj takes out a cigar and a
clip. Clips the cigar, holds it out to Max, who indi-
cates Manooj should light it, and keeps playing. Manooj
looks at Hasari, who nods. Shambu holds a match to it.
Everyone watches as if this were a major event. Manooj
takes a puff, chokes, offers the cigar to Mehboub, who
takes it, puffs, passes it. Everyone relaxes, enjoys the
peacefulness of the smoking and the aroma wafting upward.
Ram taps at Max's elbow.

          bringing everything to a standstill.
          He does a U-turn, speeds off back the way they came.

          Douglas and Jean are sitting in the traffic jam.

                         DOUGLAS
          It's funny. They call it rush
          hour, but nothing actually moves.

                         (BEAT)
          It's not that funny.

           So what d'you have to do to get a
           cup of tea round here?

                          TAMARA
           Make it.

                          (SHE POINTS)
           Tea bags. Sugar. Fridge.

                          (SHE GRINS)
           I'm off to work.
           Andy stares. Suddenly Tamara is no longer just a blast from
           the past. He sees a future - a future that he wants. He
           slowly smiles back - but she's already striding away.

           Pounding rock music, slightly distorted by distance. Jody and
           Casey are trying to get in over the boundary fence. A
           security guard is already running towards them.

                          JODY
           This is our village. Our fucking

           Ben skids his Porsche to a halt right next to Tamara's car.
           He jumps out. Boss follows. Tamara is walking towards the
           door. The distant festival is still audible. Tamara backs
           towards the door, with Ben inches away.

                          BEN
           That's Boss.

                          TAMARA

           Nicholas is writing. Beth approaches.

           There's the festival brochure. You're
           on in the Lanson Marquee. I've marked
           a few bits in case you want to read.
           Beth hands him a hardback.

                          NICHOLAS
           You're a marvel. Cheers.
           He kisses her and prepares to leave. She is suspicious.

           I could come with you.
