                         You, my son, will live through the storm. 
                         You will preserve the fragrance of our 
                         history, and add to it a touch of your 
                         own mind. Beyond that, my vision weakens.

                         But I see in the great distance a new 
                         world starting in the ruins - stirring 
                         clumsily - but in hopefulness, seeking 
                         its vast and legendary treasures. And 
                         they will all be here, my son, hidden 
                         behind the mountains in the Valley of 
                         the Blue Moon, preserved as if by a 
                         miracle.
                                      
                         The voice of the Lama, toward the last, 
                         seems to fade out. Conway, thoroughly 
                         engrossed, half-consciously waits for 
                         it to continue. Following a protracted 
                         silence, he slowly turns toward the 
                         Lama. A breeze blows through the room, 
                         ruffling curtains on the window.

CLOSE - STEAMING WATER, POURED INTO A TUB

The Handmaiden has prepared a 17th Century bathtub for
Michelle, and now retires.

                     HANDMAIDEN
          If you need me further, just ring.

As the handmaiden leaves, exiting frame, we PUSH IN on one of
the murals on the wall.  The eye of one of the figures there
is no longer the painted eye it was before, but is a real
human eye, disguised by the mural...

THE KING, IN THE SECRET PASSAGEWAY

is spying on Michelle.

THE KING'S POV

as Michelle undresses and steps into the bath.  Louis catches
tantalizing glimpses of her richly sensual body in the soapy
water, and it stokes his desire.

INT.  PALACE - MICHELLE'S NEW ROOM - DAY

Michelle stands before the mirror, staring at herself,
breaktakingly gorgeous in her new dress.  She stares for a
long time, surprised at her own beauty.

She reaches to a vase of roses and pulls one out, blotting it
around her neck, perfuming herself with its fragrance.  She
looks into the mirror, at her eyes... In guilt for what she
is already feeling, she lifts Raoul's letter to read it
again.  Then she gasps -- the King stands right before her.

                     MICHELLE
          Sire!  I -- How did you --

                     LOUIS
          How did I get in?  You're new here,
          and will soon learn many secrets.
          What is that?

                     MICHELLE
          ... Nothing.

                     LOUIS
          A letter.  May I see?

He takes the letter; she has no resistance against him.  The
King reads, his eyes hardening suddenly; but then he smiles.
