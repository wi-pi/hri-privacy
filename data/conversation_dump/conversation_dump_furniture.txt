          EXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - DAY

          The Lincoln and RV slow to a stop outside the home.

          I/E. LINCOLN - DAY
          They all stare at the empty space where the Chevy-Nova used
          to be. Jerry gets a smirk of satisfaction.

                              JERRY
                    You see that, Babe. They caved.

          EXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - DAY

          Jerry backs the RV into the drive as Nick helps his mother
          with her belongings and they enter the house. The RV scrapes
          its way through a few overhanging tree branches before Jerry
          decides it's parked.
          There comes a woman's scream from inside the house.

          INT. ESTELLE'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Jerry joins Nick and Estelle in the doorway. There in the
          living room, surrounded by all the furniture pushed neatly
          against the walls, is Jerry's camouflaged Chevy.

                              NICK
                    I guess they didn't cave after all.
          Jerry pops the hood and lets out a whistle.

                              JERRY
                    Boy, everything's complete. There's
                    even water in the windshield
                    washer.

                              ESTELLE
                    How did they ever get it in here?
                    My front door can't be more than
                    three feet wide.

                              JERRY
                    Looks like they brought it in piece
                    by piece and then reassembled it.

                    Okay. Mr. Rumpkin, what famous
                    actress was married to Frank

          gentle giant with admiration. He bashfully averts his eyes.

                              ESTELLE
                    That's nothing. You should see what
                    he did with the living room.

          INT. ESTELLE'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Nick and the other two boys pause in the doorway.
          Where once the Chevy occupied the space, the living room was
          now fairly returned to it's normal uncluttered state with all
          the furniture placed back in the original positions.
          At some point Wally must have sawed a hole in the wall shared
          by the living and dining areas because the Chevy now occupies
          that hole and has been painted and decorated such that it has
          achieved an almost seamless blend with the wall.
          Estelle goes and takes a seat on the couch.

                              ESTELLE
                    Go ahead, Wally. Show them.
          Wally blushes before he flips a switch and the tail lights
          come on, giving the living room a warm, flattering glow.

          

                                                                     86.

Sandro smiles and playfully ruffles Claudia's hair. She also smiles, then 
slowly they both head towards the hotel.

It is morning inside the Hotel Trinacria.  Claudia has just had breakfast in 
her room and is almost finished dressing. It is a rather large room, set out 
with old pieces of furniture. The place is in a state of disarray, and the 
door leading into Sandro's room is wide open. Because of the general 
disorder, Claudia is unable to find her stockings. But instead of being 
angered by this, she appears quite jovial and laughs gaily. As she continues 
to look for her stockings, Sandro appears in the doorway.
 
				SANDRO 
		Are you ready?
 
Claudia comes up to Sandro and gazes upon him with a look of adoration.

          INT. 7 TRAIN -- 1998 -- DAY
          
          TITLE: 13 YEARS LATER
          
          The train passes above used car lots, discount furniture
          stores, residential side streets...finally pulls into a
          station. The doors open. People file on, the CAMERA letting
          them go by until it spots a tall, thin COLLEGE STUDENT in a
          YARMULKE. Danny grown up?
          
          PAN with him as he sits, opens an organic chemistry text. The
          doors close. The train starts up, but the Jewish boy hardly
          notices; he is already reading. He sways with the motion of
          the car, half-hidden by other passengers. We realize he is
          being watched.
          
          REVERSE ANGLE: another YOUNG MAN, standing -- a "SUEDE-HEAD"
          (his hair cut so short it's like a fine fabric).
          
          SUEDE-HEAD'S POV: THE JEWISH BOY pushes his glasses back up
          his nose, wipes the nose with a handkerchief, puts the
          handkerchief away, and all the time his eyes have not left
          the page. Suede-head steps between passengers and stands
          directly over the Jewish boy. He looks down at the yarmulke
          pinned to the stiff, wavy hair, at the oversized shirt
          collar, scrawny neck, prominent Adam's apple, pimples,
          dandruff, ingrown facial hair...
          
          He steps closer, crowding the boy's knees. The boy shifts a
          little without looking up. Subtly but relentlessly, Suede-
          head pursues him along the bench until, unable to slide
          farther, the boy flattens his legs against the seat. Suede-
          head presses into the boy's knees.

Steven re-enters the room. The Cable Guy is watching television.

STEVEN
How's it going?

The Cable Guy holds up one finger as if to say "quiet." His eyes never leave the TV.

CABLE GUY
Guilty, guilty, guilt-freakin-tee. I
hope they fry this bastard.

Steven sees that the Cable Guy has completely redecorated the room in a fashion which makes the 
room impractical for anything other than watching television. The TV is now on the stairs 
blocking the entrance into the living room. All furniture faces the TV, making conversation 
impossible.

STEVEN
(looks around)
What happened?

CABLE GUY
(jumps to his feet)
The arrangement of your major appliances
and your furniture was causing some noisy
pics and hum bars in your reception. I
moved a few things. Cleared it right up.
Is that cool?

STEVEN
(non-confrontational)
I� guess so.

CABLE GUY
You programmed?
(off of Steven's look)
Then let me slave your remotes.

He picks up Steven's remotes, punches in a complicated series of commands, then points them at 
each other. As he holds them together he makes a face as if their power is surging through him.

CABLE GUY
Ooh, maybe we should leave these two
alone.

STEVEN
So after this I'll only need one remote
for everything?

INT.  THE FAVORITE MISTRESS' PALACE ROOMS - DAY

A young Musketeer ushers Michelle into the palace bedroom
previously occupied by the King's last mistress.  The
Musketeer leaves her alone, frozen in the center of the room,
awed by the opulence.  Her eyes play over the details:

-- The handcarved, richly upholstered furniture, beneath her
   fingertips...

-- The carved figures of cherubic angels, gleaming with gold,
   upon the posts of the bed...

-- The murals on the walls and ceiling...

Her reverie is interrupted by a HANDMAIDEN who bustles in
carrying a magnificent dress.

                     HANDMAIDEN
          After your bath put on this, it is
          the King's favorite color.  That
          letter on the desk came here for you
          this morning.

She tosses the dress onto the bed and is gone.  Left alone,
Michelle lifts the letter, and recognizes the writing.

                     MICHELLE
          Raoul!

She opens the letter and reads quickly.

                     MICHELLE
          The army!  Oh Raoul, don't despair!
          I will always be faithful...

She interrupts herself as her eyes fall on the gorgeous
dress.  She looks around at the sumptuous palace apartment,
and gazes again at the murals painted above the bed.

They depict naked gods and goddesses, in Olympian orgies.

               Yes, exactly, but his first, his first

               killed not later than seven o'clock

     Ripley comes through a dark tunnel in the Ghetto on his
     scooter. He drives past a furniture store, DRESSING TABLES
     AND MIRRORS spilling out onto the street. He glances
     sideways, sees his reflection fractured into several images
     and, for an instant, it seems AS IF DICKIE'S THERE
     WATCHING HIM. Ripley screams and swerves, crashing into the
     pavement, the scooter falling onto him and pulling him along
     the cobbled passage. The man he thought to be Dickie, an
     Italian, runs up concerned.

          Joan never failed to put me in a
          crappy mood. It was also a drag
          that I was no longer allowed to use
          my other gurney, the self-propelled
          one. It had caused a couple of
          spectacular accidents.

astonishing PANORAMA of New York and the East River. (MATTE) The cemetery
is atop a hill, and the East River, busy with ferries and vessels of
trade, glistens in the near distance. Just beyond it is Manhattan Island:
low buildings, winding narrow streets, houses surrounded by open land. A
BREEZE off the river rustles Jenny's dress and blows her hair as she steps
up to the grave site, looks at the headstone and sees ...

... it is blank. No name, no date. Clean stane.

               He heads back to the bathroom, dropping Roy onto the other

               The three bloody bodies fill the tub.

               We see Johnnie's arm hanging over the edge as Caesar snaps 
               the shower curtain around, hiding them.

               is broken, cushions split open, pictures shattered, holes 
               punched in the drywall -- even the carpeting has been torn

CANNON (one of the Accountant's boys, whom we have not seen

the reception desk. The large room is populated by
overstuffed and threadbare furniture.

LAUGHLIN looks very much like Dub Taylor and speaks Spanish
just about as badly. He flashes a quick grin from behind the
counter as Cannon draws near. At the switchboard behind
Laughlin, CARMEN, maybe 35, sits next to the telephone jacks
(all of them idle) readinc a movie magazine.

                    CANNON
          You Laughlin?

          Yes, sir, and that's my wife and that's
          Junior.

Laughlin indicates a seventeen year old BELLBOY sleeping in
one of the overstuffed chairs.

          No trouble. You came to the right place,
          one thing we got is a lot of rooms. What
          else can I do for you?

          Mr Collins, Charlotte and Elizabeth are led up a vast
          stairway which is painted with visions of hell. Elizabeth
          stops in front of a painting of a devil. She stares at

          Collins chiding her.

          The salon at Rosings is spectacularly grand; hideously
          so. Heavy furniture, rows of servants. The three guests
          are shown in by the footman. Again Mr Collins scrapes
          the floor with his bow.

                         MR COLLINS

          Miss de Bourg.
          Lady Catherine is a haughty, bossy woman. Pretty
          • unspeakable, really. Her daughter is a sickly, irritable-
          looking creature.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          So you are Elizabeth Bennet.

                shooting someone? Just missing
                them. That was a very good shot
                up at the cabin.

                              BLOMKVIST
                It didn't work. I'm here.

                Mikael, it did work.     You're here.
      They come through a pantry, at the end of which is a
      door.

                                MARTIN
                Open it.
      Blomkvist does. Sees steps leading into darkness. As
      they descend Martin flicks a switch and bare fluorescent
      tubes flicker on to reveal: A furnace. Washer. Dryer.
      Old discarded furniture. And another door. A steel one.
      As they approach it, Martin presses a little remote and
      the lock on the steel door clicks.
                                MARTIN
                Push it open.

KLUTE, BREE

questioningly.

	Company outing or picnic or
	something like that.

			BREE
	Isn't that sweet.
		(then)
	Well it could be any one of them
	bubi; I get to see them all.

She separates from Klute, around the table (but
remains standing, restless). Klute puts photo
aside, prepares to take notes, as she pleads --

			BREE (CONT'D)
	Look -- please -- will you just try
	to get it from my side? A year ago.
	I was in the life fulltime. I was
	living on Park with leather
	furniture and a million dresses.
	Then they dropped on me, the fuzz,
	they caged me -- they started
	asking me about a man, some man,
	I'm supposed to have seen a year
	before that. Two years ago, two. He
	could be in Yemen!

She waits for Klute to respond -- he doodles
permissively on his pad of paper -- she goes on.

			BREE (CONT'D)
	A name. Grunemann. Nothing. And
	they showed me pictures like this
	and they meant nothing. Then they
	asked me, well had I been getting
	letters, from someone out there in
	Cabbageville --

			KLUTE
	-- Tuscarora --

			BREE
	All right, yes, I had been. Those
	sick, wild letters -- I'm watching
	you, gonna follow you, gonna punish
	you, kill you et cetera. Well, they
	said, all right that's Grunemann.
	So try to remember when you and he 
	- when -- well I don't know, there
	was that dumper once, he sounded
	like that dumper --
		(explains)
	Dumpers; they get their kicks
	beating you up. A man hired me
	once, then tried to really kill me 
	- that'd be about two years ago.

Without warning she wheels to the open windows, and
shouts out full-voiced -- both startling and
somewhat intriguing Klute --

			BREE (CONT'D)
		(shouts)
	OK Tommy-baby, Allie-Allie-in-free
	kid, I got the gumdrops.

Turns around again, to Klute. Cheerfully --

He starts on, simply assuming that she'll follow.
(There is a degree of acquaintanceship in their
manners now - a reluctant collaboration.)

			BREE
	You sure pull a lot of mileage out
	of a hundred dollars.

-- and follows on. He checks numbers, then crosses
street diagonally toward a half-framed house.

INT. NEWARK HOUSE - DAY

A downshot from second floor level toward the entry
way where KLUTE &amp; BREE appear. KLUTE strikes a
match to inspect the names of tenants. He and Bree
climb through stench and litter to the second floor
-- a door. From somewhere near at hand come the
sounds of someone RETCHING. A square of wood has
been sawed out of the door itself, removing handle
and lock -- light sifts through. Klute hesitates,
decides against knocking, pushes in.

INT. ARLYN'S APARTMENT - DAY

The retching sounds are coming from the connecting
room. No one visible here. A very few barren pieces
of furniture. We hear ARLYN'S VOICE ask from the
next room --

			ARLYN (O.S.)
	Cappy?

ARLYN enters rather eagerly. She sees Klute first,
then Bree -- recognizes her -- retires flat against
a wall, holding one palm outwards to shield her
face. She is unbelievably gaunt. Inside one elbow,
looking rather like a birthmark, we see a lacework
of purple where her veins have pulped together.

			BREE
	Arlyn? Honey?
		(then)
	Look, it's all right.

From the connecting room a MAN'S VOICE (Berger's)
calling out hoarsely.

			BERGER (O.S.)
	Is it Cappy? Cappy? --

			BREE
	Arlyn, it's all right.

BERGER hastens, stumbles, into the doorframe
carrying a CAR-RADIO with wires dangling, speaks
before he sees them.

EXT. BROWNSTONE ENTRYWAY - NIGHT

Bree, Klute approach unhurriedly along the
sidewalk. She is holding his arm, HUMS to herself,
enjoys the evening.

INT. STAIRWALL - NIGHT

We follow them up.

INT. ANGLE INTO BREE APARTMENT - NIGHT

The apartment is a shambles -- furniture
overturned, decorations ripped from the wall,
bedding scattered and ripped.

INT. BREE APARTMENT - NIGHT

Klute jettisons the grocery bags, thrusts himself
inside, looks quickly about, finds no one. Bree
follows more slowly, whispering:

			BREE
	Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.

			KLUTE
	Don't touch anything.

He moves quickly to the rear of the apartment,
looks at the rear window which has been broken
inward in a litter of glass -- then returns to the
table at the front of the apartment; his folders.
Bree cracks wise, unsteadily.

			BREE
	You suppose he's a married fella?

                A small schoolhouse will go there.
                We need it badly as many of the
                children are barred from the local
                schools due to their infirmities.

                We also require a blacksmith's shop
                so we can craft braces here on the
                premises. I've found a wonderful
                local man who can make crutches and
                canes. His work is outstanding. Of
                course what is most desperately
                needed is a hospital. That's going
                to put my fund raising abilities to
                the test.

	Deputy goes to the passenger side. We PAN with Buddy's hand 
	down to the door handle--he grabs it, flings it open--the 
	overhead LIGHT flicks ON and there lie YOUNG SAM and PILAR, 
	teenagers, half their clothes off and just about to close 
	the deal. PILAR SCREAMS and the Deputy throws the door open 
	by their heads--

	Buddy grabs Sam's ankles and yanks him out of the car onto

    The apartment is old and in desperate need of a paint job.
    It's a large space, crammed with the stuff of a long life.
    There are family photos, piles of National Geographic
    magazines next to faded velvety couches and solid furniture.
    A small, vintage color TV sits alone in the corner.

    There's a quiet reception going on, with most people wearing
    black, or dark colors, and talking softly to each other.
    Amongst the mostly older friends and relatives of the
    deceased are Brian's sister AUDREY and her husband JAMES, and
    their teenage son, LIAM, dressed in a suit. They are sitting
    on a couch next to Brian, leafing through a photo album.

    Kumail closes the bedroom door behind him.

      close, with a shallow, blurry focus. It's like the first
      moments after a dream -- just fragments.

      Scissors cut the string. The man wraps it around his left
      wrist. A loop. A bracelet.

      We see the man's teeth, the edge of his chin as he pulls the
      knot tight.

      His fingers pull against the string.   Solid.   It won't break
      easily.

      Like most Laurel Canyon garages, this one has never held a

          A three-story brownstone in an expensive West Village
          neighborhood. As Wyatt leads Jonathan to the staircase, they
          pass a papery-faced GENTLEMAN                                   (50s) in a fine suit.

          INT. WYATT'S APARTMENT

          Urban chic to a serious degree. Big terrace, funky furniture,
          framed snapshots of Wyatt with similarly hip and attractive
          young friends - and great art, including an entrancing image
          of a burning candle just slightly out of focus.

          WYATT
          Like it? It's a Gerhard Richter. Kleiner
          downstairs is a hot shot art dealer - he
          hooked me up with the gallery in Munich.
          Wyatt disappears into the next room. Alone, Jonathan wanders,
          pauses by the framed snapshots. The young people in them are
          like Wyatt -- beautiful, strong, wealthy. Jonathan pauses by
          one photo in which Wyatt looks a bit younger, his hair
          bleached blonde and loosely spiked.

          WYATT (O.S.)
          Talk about a bad look.
          Startled, Jonathan quickly turns to find Wyatt standing right
          behind him,. a slick, expensive SUIT draped over his arm.

          Thick smoke clouds the stairs and corridor. Suit jacket over
          his head, Jonathan is hurriedly escorted by the Fire Worker.
          His own door has already been kicked open, splintered at its
          hinges. The place looks like it's been turned upside down,
          furniture soaking wet, charred areas on walls.

CRASHES over. He bounds down the porch steps.

                        LANDON
                 (explaining bike)
          They took my license for 30 days.
          But nobody's pressing charges.

The Reverend looks at Jamie, concerned. Landon tries the
kickstand, then leans the bike against a carefully trimmed
bush. Not the best place.

                        JAMIE
          I'll get something for us to
          drink --

                          LANDON
          Don't bother!

But she's already gone.   The Reverend gestures toward the
open front door.


INT. SULLIVAN LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Dark and prim with stiff furniture left to fade. Landon
pokes around, then stares at a photo of little girl Jamie
with her parents. He looks up, aware that the Reverend is
studying him closely.

     Kate and Charlie stand in their backyard, which is criss-

Luke slams the door behind. Allen, alone stares out the

It's the same BRAHMS from his mother's bedroom.

          INT. MARGARET'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

          The sun peeks over the horizon.   There's a stunning view of
          Central Park from this apartment, but whoever lives here isn't
          watching.
          As we wander through expensive furniture, a steady THUMP, THUMP,
          THUMP echoes through the apartment.   Eventually, we see MARGARET
          MILLS (37) running on a treadmill, watching "The O.C." on Tivo,
          and reading a manuscript.
          She sprints as the clock on her treadmill goes to zero.   As she
          hits a button to stop the treadmill...

          A hand knocks an alarm clock off a table to shut it up.   RICHARD
          PAXTON (26) wakes up on pink sheets and looks around to figure
          out where he is. There are multiple framed pictures of the same
          model on the walls.
          Richard looks at the clock and gets up quickly when he sees it is
          6:16 AM.   Unfortunately for him, he is very hung over.

          RICHARD
          Where are my clothes?
          A blob beneath the sheets next to him answers.   SIMONE is the
          model on the walls and is really, really hot.

          SIMONE
          In the kitchen.   I think.   Can I make you
          some coffee?

          RICHARD
          Sorry, I gotta go.   I'm late.
          Richard hurries to the kitchen.   Socks are on the butcher block
          next to an empty champagne bottle.   Shoes in the sink.   He finds
          his pants on the floor and puts them on.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Have you seen my belt?
          Simone looks around and sees it tied to her headboard.

          with the same fireglow seen earlier, a film of gray ash
          covers dead lawn and shrubs and inside the paintwork is grimy
          and colorless now, a lot of the furniture gone. A pile of
          broken up furniture and pieces of the piano are-stacked up
          next to the fireplace. In the fireplace the scorched, ashen
          remains of piano keys. The WOMAN is now heavily pregnant. The
          MAN sets down chipped old plates and spoons, spoons beans
          from a pot and sits to eat.
          As the WOMAN starts to eat she winces and freezes with a look

	INT. FLAT

	Striped wallpaper gives way to flowers in the bedrooms.
	Huge four-poster beds in the bedrooms, and large

	WE MOVE INTO A DIMLY LIT PARLOUR

	We see Claudia draped in lace standing on a petit point
	chair as a DRESSMAKER measure out a garment.

	Louis can be seen, in an inner room.

				DRESSMAKER
		Monsieur, I need more light. I
		shall go slind if you do not bring
		me a lamp, or let me fit this child
		during the day. Ouch!

	She has pricked her hand. A spot of blood appears on
	her finger Claudia takes her hand.

				CLAUDIA
		Let me kiss it better...

	Claudia brings the hand to her lips. The dressmaker
	abruptly pulls her finger away, in pain again.

	CLOSEUP - her finger, two holes showing.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		A little child she was, but also a
		fierce killer, now capable of the

	Lestat walks through - sees the dressmaker lying dead
	at Claudia's feet, Claudia still on the chair in the
	half-finished dress.

				LOUIS
		I love you Claudia. Always. And we

	He lifts her into the carriage and drives off, leaving
	the silent waters of the swamp.


	INT. FLAT - NIGHT

	Sturdy mulatto workmen lifting cases and trunks out of
	the apartment. All the furniture is covered in white
	sheets. Claudia dressed in a cap and hat, is playing
	the piano by the light of one remaining oil-lamp.

	Louis comes from her room with the cage of canaries.

		The birds. We forgot about the

                (play by play)
         What do you think, rickshaw fans,
         can he do it?
The crowd isn't in for fun. Hasari strains forward.
The rickshaw moves with him. Ram moves alongside,
shouting instructions and oaths. A cop comes on the run,
screaming at Hasai... which makes Ram importune more
strongly and Max joke more vociferously.
Even under this incredible pressue, Hasari gains
confidence and begins to move quicker, earning shouts
of approval from Max and Ram, who now has trouble
keeping up as they make their way through the maelstrom,
an avalanche of oaths following them.

INT. GODFATHER'S HOUSE - DAY
At first all we see are feet on a marble floor. The
Goonda's in his running shoes, then Ram and Hasari's
bare feet.
This is the partitioned splendor of an old house
sprinkled with the relics of a grand colonial past.
Everything is baroque, rotting and somehow impressive.
Hasari has never been anywhere like this, and is caught
between curiosity and fear of breathing.

INT. "THRONE ROOM"
The three men enter a large room shuttered from the sun-
light -- dusty and packed with a ramshackle assortment
of furniture. Two fat blue titmice perch in a cage next
to ambitious plaster portrait of Napolean.
Sitting behind a desk is Ashoka, leaning over a mirror,
squeezing a balky pimple.
Near a large window, his 60-year-old father, GHATAK, in
a European jacket and dhoti, works with intense concen-
tration at repairing a pair of broken glasses with a
twist of fine wire.
The three new arrivals stand silent and respectful
before the desk. At last, without raising his head...

          Harry exits the bar and becomes immersed in the different noises of
          the street, the passersby, their different sounds and corporeal odors.
          Auditory life. The camera swirls around his head. At first he hears
          all the noises, indistinctly mixed, and then he begins to separate
          them. He selects one he likes, the rest of the sounds of the street
          disappear or their volume is lowered. Girls, cars, high heels, the
          smells of different ethnicities. A multi-racial street. Harry
          selects an odor (the body of a woman, whose aroma appears and
          disappears), Harry follows it, having also singled out the sound of
          her heels. He loses them. He finds them again.

          

          
          He walks self-assuredly, without tripping either on the urban
          furniture or the people. He leans, lightly, on his umbrella, which he
          uses as a cane. At first glance he doesn't appear blind ...

          

          
          He reaches a pedestrian crossing. Nearby, he recognizes the odor
          which had attracted him, he follows its trace until he reaches the
          sidewalk. The odor emanates from a young Girl, just next to him,
          waiting before the crosswalk. Harry searches with the tip of the
          umbrella, until he brushes her shoe. He excuses himself, as if the
          contact had been inadvertent. The girl regards him. Harry then takes
          one step forward, intent on crossing the street, the cars come very
          close to him, almost running him over. (A real sense of danger). The

          25. LENA'S PARENTS' HOME. INT. DAY. 1990.


          

          
          Lena locks the door from inside. It's a humble and small apartment,
          Magdalena and her mother situate the man on the bed in the master
          bedroom, in the most comfortable way possible.

          

          
          The d�cor reflects the bad taste of the era, especially of that social
          class, here and there a certain rural detail stands out. Antique
          photographs of the grandparents. Photographs of the Father in his
          policeman uniform, next to the Mother.
          Over the headboard, there is a crucifix on the wall and perhaps a
          thick, wooden rosary. Religious images on the nighstands. Attention
          placed on the bedspread, the curtains, the dresser, the closet and the
          walls. Everything is new, ugly period furniture. The effect
          generated is of a somber kitsch.

          

          
          Lena opens a dresser drawer, on top of it sits the picture of the
          father in his policeman uniform, with the Mother. She finds a Star
          9mm pistol. She grabs it and tries its weight, the mother sees her
          and tells her to leave the weapon in its place. (Perhaps at that very
          moment the mother is injecting the Father with morphine).
          Cut to.
          In the dinning hall, Lena hands her mother money so that she can buy
          food and her father's medications.

          Ray is thirty-five years old and his physique is somewhere between
          freakish and bohemian but expensively dressed, hard to classify, thin,
          with a beard. Only when he speaks he reveals his well-bred origin
          (not excessively, nor parodically, just sufficiently evocative). He
          is excited by the very fact of being there, it seems it is something
          he has been desiring for some time.
          He takes advantage of the fact that Harry cannot see him in order to
          observe him without reserve.
          During the conversation, Harry is not always sitting. At some point
          he moves (to look for cigarettes, perhaps) and remains standing.

           ...After having written five dramas, I had finally
           managed to write a script for a comedy, or that's what
           I thought. I wanted to change genres... to take a risk
           (ironic-destructive) And I swear I accomplished that,
           the part about taking a risk.

          

          
          In 1994, everyone calls Harry "Mateo". He is sitting behind a table
          filled with papers, photographs, books, magazines, an ashtray, pencil
          and pen holders, etc. At its center, a script lies open, with tons of
          notes scribbled on the margins of its pages. He is finishing the
          definitive version of "Girls and Suitcases".

          

          
          The casual messiness of the place produces its own aesthetic. The
          only decorations on the walls, here and there, not following any
          particular symmetrical rule, are postcards of painters, actors or
          landscapes, held in place by tacks. There is also a newspaper page
          that has caught Mateo's attention. Or some astonishing photograph,
          taken from a magazine. The cover of some magazine. Everything without
          framing, tacked directly onto the wall.
          The furniture is pastel, medium-shade green or red, with velvet
          tapestry, worn and outmoded. The pieces don't match, but they look
          good together.

          She is a woman unmarked by the march of time.)

          man, they are accomplices in everything, both professionally and
          emotionally.

          inside the bungalow. The photograph is a clear metaphor for the
          mysterious quality of the island as well as of the isolation of Mateo
          and Lena and of their fusion.

          

          
          While Mateo writes, Lena cleans the dishes or she does the laundry in

       Melanie and Ben enter the house.

       INT. MELANIE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
       The Bruwer living room is a profusion of piles of papers,
       of books on shelves, on tables, on the floor, paintings
       -- records, African sculptures.
       On the floor tangled lengths of flex leading from a
       record player to two voluminous speakers.

       A settee, a chess set. The furniture is old and well-
       used, dominated by a large leather club chair -- two
       big cats sleeping on it. It's civilized pandemonium.

was spawned.
      Ben looks at the shelves and smiles.

                   Please sit down, on that chair.

          Everywhere we look is white, the walls, ceiling,
          furniture -- all of it. Only the old Baldwin upright
          piano has escaped painting. Dwight eyes it
          suspiciously.

          Dwight's face tells us that something still doesn't
          suit him. He glances at Toby, Toby nods, and they

	Back in the office, Kid Twist is "interviewing" one by one,
	a group of con men lined up outside the office door.  A
	gray-haired old buzzard, Curly Jackson, approaches the table

	Twist immediately removes his overalls, revealing the suit

          it's gone. And you feel like you
          can never get it back. it's like
          you feel homesick for a place that
          doesn't even exist. But maybe it's
          like this rite of passage, you
          know? And you won't ever have that
          feeling again until you create a
          A new idea of "home" for yourself,
          for the family you start, for your
          kids. It's like this cycle.

                         (BEAT)
          Maybe that's all a family really
          is; a group of people who miss the
          same imaginary place.
          They hold eye contact. The SPLASH of a CANNONBALL swings
          their gaze to the others horsing around in the deep end. Sam
          leans her head over and rests it on his shoulder.

                         SAM
          Maybe.

          INT. JESSE'S MANSION: LIVING ROOM -- LATER

          An enormous and desolate LIVING ROOM devoid of any furniture
          or decoration. Mark, Jesse, Sam and Large sit huddled under
          towels at the foot of a colossal fire place that houses a
          small blaze. They eat potato chips and drink canned beer.
          They are all pretty tipsy. Mark plays with a "Silent Velcro"
          sample.

      John sits on the bare wood floor of the living room. His
      head turns as he hears someone POUNDING on the front door.
      He throws a look to the garage, thinks about the gun;
      dismisses the idea. Then he hears the voice: his brother.

      John doesn't move. As we pull back we see that the living
      room and dining room have been stripped of every bit of
      furniture, save an old TV set sitting on a box. John knows
      he can't let his brother see this.

      The MALE NEIGHBOR in the house to the south opens his door
      and looks out and scowls.

                               MALE NEIGHBOR

                         town's sore and cranky at each other."
 
                                                              
                         And I kept saying, "Well, that's fine, 
                         but how's a guy gonna go around loving 
                         the kind of neighbors we got? Old Sourpuss 
                         for instance!"
                                      
                         (laughing)
                                     
                         You see, Sourpuss Smithers is a guy 
                         who lives all alone next door to us. 
                         He's a cranky old man and runs a second-hand 
                         furniture store. We haven't spoken to 
                         him for years. I always figured he was 
                         an ornery old gent that hated the world 
                         cause he was always slamming his garage 
                         door and playing the radio so loud he 
                         kept half the neighbors up.
                                      
                         (laughing)
                                     
                         ? 639 ?

                         us about how they cancelled their milk 
                         last week, and how, when he found a 
                         note in the bottle he got kinda curious 
                         like and he sorta peeked in under the 
                         blinds and found the house empty. "If 
                         you ask me," he says, "they're starving."

                         Old man Delaney has been bringing his 
                         furniture over to my place at night, 
                         one piece at a time, and selling it.
