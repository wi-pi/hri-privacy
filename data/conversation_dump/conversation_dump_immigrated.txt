          favor that.

          Is anyone else here from the Board?

          DAN WHITE
          You're the only one who showed up I
          think.

          HARVEY MILK
          Were you christened here?

          DAN WHITE
          Yes. Right here. Same Parish. My
          grandma immigrated here when this
          was an Irish Catholic city. The
          City of St. Francis... A lot's
          changed here since then.
