          We don't know where we are yet but it's certainly not the

          thunder and the soft cool jazz playing makes the air of this
          room with the white wall, wherever it is, claustrophobic,
          even erotic.
          A YOUNG BLACK MAN whose name is PAUL comes into frame and
          leans against this white wall. Right off, you say this
          YOUNG MAN is a winner.
          PAUL frowns, then smiles. Right into the camera.

          Very good. You owe me.
          PAUL takes off his shirt. HE's strongly built. HE throws

                         
          the shirt directly into the camera.

          TRENT looks up from his bank of computers at TESS.
          TRENT's pinched face looks as if it has never, known one

          PAUL dressed in ragged clothes stands huddled in a doorway
          to get out of the freezing rain.
          TRENT passes by the doorway.
          TRENT is gone.
          Then TRENT reappears and stares at PAUL.

          INT TRENT CONWAY'S APARTMENT NIGHT
          PAUL stands against the WHITE WALL we've seen earlier.
          Rain. Distant thunder. Jazz playing somewhere.
          PAUL, unlike the elegant PAUL we have seen, is dressed in
          torn jeans, a ripped tank top, dirty high top sneakers.
          This is the PAUL we first saw.

                         
          PAUL looks at TRENT with a mixture of contempt and I dare
          you.
          PAUL stretches out on the bed.
          HE pulls out a thick address -book from under him.

                         PAUL
          What's this?
          PAUL speaks.street talk speech. Hardly what we've heard.

                         TRENT
          My address book.
          TRENT tries to take the address book away from PAUL.

                         PAUL
          All these names. Addresses.
          Tell me about these people.
          TRENT lies along side PAUL.

                         TRENT
          This is where I wanted you to be...
          Right here...
          PAUL, hypnotised by the-'address book, slaps TRENT away from
          him and gets out of the bed.

    It's very late. It's quiet. Just the sounds of The City

    LINDA SANTANA CRAIG, an attractive Hispanic woman in her
    thirties, waits at the ELEVATED STATION for the F train.

    Linda looks great. She's dressed festively but tastefully.
    Next to her is her eleven year old DAUGHTER, ALICIA. She is
    twirling about the platform, still jazzed from the birthday
    party they attended in The City.

    Alicia wears a black dress with a pink cardigan and has a pink
    handbag. We notice a CHARM BRACELET with four-leaf clovers on
    her right wrist.

    The mother and daughter wait alone at one end of the station
    platform.

    TWO TEENAGE BOYS wait at the other end. They speak soft,
    SLURRED SPANISH to each other.

    Linda gives the boys a glance and evaluates. She watches them
    as Alicia spits a wad of gum into her mom's open hand.

                         ask you a couple of questions.

               Korda steps aside and lets Baffert enter. Korda closes the 
               door. Baffert scans the place. Not bad. He listens to the 
               music. A smile grows on his face.

               A slight hesitation from Korda. He glances around the 
               apartment. For what reason, we don't know. Maybe to make 
               sure there's nothing incriminating around. He opens the door.

          So presumably, Clever Miss Stubbs
          won. And here you are, reading
          all those pony essays. I don't
          know. These last few months, I've
          been to Paris, and to jazz clubs,
          and I've eaten in wonderful
          restaurants, and seen wonderful
          films, heard beautiful music...

                    MISS STUBBS
          I'm sure you have. But I was
          filled up with beautiful things,
          books and music and conversation,
          in exactly the same way at
          Cambridge. And I didn't have to
          pay the same sort of price. Are
          you taking precautions, Jenny?

Jenny stares at her angrily.

                    JENNY
          It's nothing to do with that.

               I gathered that much. But why do
               we have to crawl around the West
               End looking for his car? Why
               don't you just make an

     The four walk in and take their coats over to the
     cloakroom. The club is a smoky West End club, full of            
     smartly-dressed and dubious-looking men, and young,
     glamorous, dubious-looking women. Jenny and Helen look out
     of place - Helen too ethereal, Jenny too innocent. There is
     jazz playing.

                         DANNY
               There he is.

     We see a nasty-looking man in his late 30s/early 40s. He is
     wearing a white sharksin suit and smoking a big cigar. He's
     standing by the roulette table, talking to an even nastier-
     looking man in a dark suit.

     They find a table at the back and sit down. A waitress
     comes over to their table.

                         DAVID
               A bottle of champagne, please.

                         DANNY
               Oh-ho. Champagne, eh?

     He looks at Jenny and David expectantly.

               Don't be bashful.

          So what I do isn't worth doing.
          Or what Miss Stubbs does, or Mrs
          Wilson, or any of us here.

Jenny doesn't say anything. The headmistress takes her
silence as an admission of defeat.

                    HEADMISTRESS
          Because none of us would be here
          without our degrees, you realise
          that, don't you? And yes, of
          course studying is hard, and
          boring, and...

Jenny can't contain herself any longer.

                       JENNY
          Boring!

          I'm sorry?

                    JENNY
          Studying is hard and boring.
          Teaching is hard and boring. So
          you're telling me to be bored,
          and then bored, and then finally
          bored again, this time for the
          rest of my life. This whole
          stupid country is bored. There's
          no life in it, or colour in it,
          or fun in it. It's probably just
          as well that the Russians are
          going to drop a nuclear bomb on
          us any day now. So my choice is
          either to do something hard and
          boring, OR to marry my... my Jew,
          and go to Paris and Rome and
          listen to jazz and read and eat
          good food in nice restaurants and
          have fun. It's not enough to
          educate us any more, Mrs Walters.
          You've got to tell us why you're
          doing it.

     She grinds to a halt. She has never had to answer this
     question before.

                         HEADMISTRESS
               It doesn't have to be teaching,
               you know. There's the Civil
               Service.

     Jenny stands up.

     and rights.

            This is how much I'm washed with
            J.J....

As Elwell reads, Sidney continues giving a passing scrutiny -
apparently casual - to a picture of a girl on the magazine
cover.

                         SIDNEY
            Look, Otis, I make no brief for my
            bilious private life, but he's got
            the morals of a guinea pig and the
            scruples of a gangster.

Elwell shows no undue enthusiasm for the item.

                         ELWELL
                   (dryly)
            A fine, fat dirty item.
                   (offering it back to Sidney)
            Who's it about?

But Sidney doesn't take the paper back; he explains:

                         SIDNEY
            A kid named Dallas, who runs a
            dinky jazz quintet.
                   (he leans closer)
            He keeps company with J.J.'s
            screwball sister...

ELWELL

This does get a reaction, a flicker of genuine interest.
Elwell reads the item for a second time.

SIDNEY AND ELWELL

Watching Elwell read, Sidney encourages:

                         SIDNEY
            It's a real goody if, like me, you
            wanna clobber J.J.!

Now Elwell lays the item down in front of him.  Clearly, he
is considering it.  Sidney prompts again.

                         SIDNEY
            He's got his TV tomorrow.  He'd
            read it just before rehearsals.

Elwell nods.  But he is still reluctant.

            Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in
            one neat bundle, addressed to the
            dumps - to oblivion.  We're going
            great, but please play it my way.
            I cased this kid.
            Know his ins and outs...He's fulla
            juice and vinegar, just begging for
            some big shot like you to give him
            a squeeze.  Do little Sidney a

                   (impatiently)
            No, that's the point - he won't
            accept your favor!  The manager
            yes, but not the boy.

A pause.  Hunsecker renumerates.

                         HUNSECKER
            Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll

                         SIDNEY
            Sure, he steams her up - wants her
            to stand on her own two feet and
            all that jazz!

                         HUNSECKER
            And who's feet is she on now?

                         SIDNEY
            Presumably yours...
                   (a hasty addition)
            That's according to St. Dallas.

          Ginsy, you're hired!

Allen smiles a mile wide. He's in.

Suddenly, the jazz singer stops. The band puts down their
instruments. POLICEMEN escort a businessman and another
gentleman out of the bathroom, in HANDCUFFS. The mood in the
bar chills.

Allen, terrified, looks at David, who looks back, knowing
exactly now who Allen is.

Drunk, Allen and Lucien stumble to the ground.

Lucien shoves Allen. Allen trips off the chair, the noose
snaps tight...and suddenly he's hanging in mid-air. He
struggles. Lucien tries to help, but falls off his own chair.

The pipe starts to bend.

Allen and Lucien panic as they swing through the room,

The pipe BREAKS. They crash to the ground.

A beat of relief -- are we alive? -- and the two break out

     Ripley shakes hands with Herbert Greenleaf as he gets into

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, NEW YORK. DAY.

     A vinyl RECORD revolves in close up.  An exuberant and
     mysterious VOICE is scat singing. Wild. Then the sound slides
     into a raucous big band jazz number:  Dizzy Gillespie's <i>The
     Champ</i>. A HAND ejects the record. When the camera finds the
     man's face it is BLINDFOLDED. He's hot. He's wearing an
     undershirt. He's trying to identify the recording.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               I don't know. Count Basie?  Duke
               Ellington. I don't know. Count Basie.

     The man pulls of the blindfold, examines the record cover of
     the disc he's been trying to learn, needs to put on glasses
     to do so, is irritated by his mistake. He ejects the record.

     A pile of other jazz records are strewn across a cluttered
     table which includes classical sheet music and a paper
     keyboard. One hand idly mimes at the keys.

     Another song for Ripley to identify is on the gramophone.
     Chet Baker's <i>My Funny Valentine</i>.  Signs everywhere of
     packing. A suitcase. Books about Italy.  Ripley paces in this
     BASEMENT room, which is bathroom, kitchen, living room and
     bedroom all in one.  Tiny, tidy, squalid and sad. The windows
     give onto bars and a wall.

                         RIPLEY
               Don't even know if this is a man or a
               woman.

     There's a violent row going on in the room above his head. He
     flinches.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

     Ripley, shining his shoes, packing almost done, is testing
     himself on another piece of music. Free jazz saxophone:
     Charlie Parker's <i>Koko</i>.  He listens hard, recognizes the
     track.

     Dickie and Ripley on the Vespa. There's a steep incline where
     the road winds down towards Naples and, as the Vespa gains

     INT. JAZZ CLUB, NAPLES. NIGHT.

     Ripley's really singing, carrying the burden of <i>My Funny
     Valentine</i> in a flawless imitation of Chet Baker. Dickie is
     playing some sax. After a verse, there's spontaneous
     applause. Dickie, impressed beams at Ripley.

     INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE. NIGHT.

     A NEW ICEBOX, incongruous in pride of place in the living
     room, casts its glow on a delighted Dickie as he pulls out a
     couple of beers, handing one to Ripley who is paging through
     his copy of the Collected Works of Shakespeare.

                         DICKIE
               I could fuck this icebox I love it so

               I mean it as a compliment. You've got
               such great taste, I don't know. Most of
               the thugs at Princeton had tasted
               everything and had no taste. Used to say,
               the cream of America: rich and thick.
               Freddie's the perfect example.

                         RIPLEY
               Then I'll take it as a compliment.

                         DICKIE
               I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!

               Ha.

               Do you even like jazz - or was that
               something for my benefit?

                   (conceding, without guile)
               I've gotten to like it. I've gotten to
               like everything about the way you live.
               It's one big love affair. If you knew my
               life back home in New York...

     Dickie's distracted by the drummer who's playing an extrovert
     solo, doesn't hear the confession of love.

                         DICKIE
               I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what
               do you think about drums?

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         DICKIE
               So cool.

     He mimes a high-hat and snare. Ripley can't quite credit this
     - it's superficiality.

answered by a woman's voice.

			JOE 
	Hey, Shirley... Miss who? Oh, yeah,
	well, when will Missus Gardner be
	home? ... I'm a friend of hers, a
	goddam good friend... Shee-it, I
	can't wait till then...

Joe hangs up while the answering service's voice is still
talking. The match has burned out. Joe flips it away.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DUSK

Joe loiters outside a gag headline print shop, his eyes
following a man in homburg and chesterfield.

EXT./INT. METROPOLE - DUSK

Joe lingers momentarily, identifying with the violence in a
jazz drummer, his eyes searching for a pickup.

INT. ARCADE - DUSK

Joe tests his skills in a shoot-down with a large metal
cowboy and kills him, a recorded voice sneaks, "Got me!" as
the cowboy slumps. Joe glances off as he hears polite
applause...

			TOWNY'S VOICE
	Bravo...

... TOWNY -- a stout, round-faced man -- clasps Joe's hand
between both of his own, like an old friend.

			TOWNY 
	How are you?
		(more quietly)
	Townsend P. Locke, from Chicago.
	Call me Towny. I'm here to attend a
	paper manufacturers' convention
	and, frankly, to have a little fun,
	dammit...

Towny grips Joe's elbow, almost forcibly leading him away.

EXT. SIDE STREET WEST OF BROADWAY - DUSK

Towny's face appears huge at Joe's shoulder.

          Poppa M listens, far off scratchy music. He moves quietly through
          the house, stopping at the foot of the stairs...listens. He removes

          The Roman, swirls a tomato in a plate of salt and bites into it.
          Beside him, a horned phonograph plays 40's Jazz. Behind him, we see
          that the greenhouse is merely an extension of the home.

          
          The Roman sits in front of a sunken fire pit at a low flame. Across
          the pit, an empty chair. Extended before him is a stunning garden,
          standing in stark contrast to the common house: vines, flowers,
          cobblestone walks, fountains. The center piece is a Turkish pool
          with pure white Lillys afloat.
          Poppa M slowly approaches the Roman from behind. He holsters his
          weapon and sits. The Roman halts the phonograph.

       Eric, Zed, Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Claude, and Oliver are 
       all walking down some dank stone steps into a cellar.  
       Somewhere crazy Raymond Scott Toy Jazz music is playing.

       An old wine cellar has been converted into a Toy Jazz club.  
       Nothing fancy...dirt floors, chairs and small tables 
       scattered about...but the arched brick ceilings make for 
       great acoustics.

       ON STAGE

       a BAND is playing away.  In the audience sit about TWELVE 
       FRENCH PEOPLE, all enjoying the music.

       AT THE BUFFET

       In the back of the club near the doors some tables have been 
       set up with a buffet of local cuisine on it.  Behind the 
       tables are two rotund but happy French women MIRELLE and 
       JOSEPHINE.

       Eric, Zed, Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Claude, and Oliver walk 
       in and immediately start blabbing away in French to Mirelle 
       and Josephine.

       Eric hands them some money.

               It's a free country, you can hate
               me. Ain't like that's exactly
               news. But disrespectin' me,
               that's where the road ends, Sara.
               I don't want him up here again. I
               mean it.

                             SARA
               You mean it because he's black.

               Don't start that bullshit!

                             SARA
               Why's it bullshit? Because you
               hang with black guys and play jazz
               and have the hots for Angela
               Bassett?

                don't expect me to believe it. I
                saw how you looked at him. But
                you didn't see him. Well, for
                your information, he's a straight-
                A student with more heart and guts
                than you'll ever have!

                                 ROY
                   Yeah? Well, when are you gonna
                   have the guts to say what you

           You really were very good, Miss
           Monroe.

           Rows of small tables are arranged around the stage, a few
           young couples are dancing to a jazz trio playing an
           exuberant, upbeat number. The music comes to an end and
           the couples return to their tables, COLIN and LUCY among
           them. There is champagne on the table, COLIN pours them
           both a glass.

                          LUCY
           Are you sure you can afford all
           this?

                          COLIN
           Oh, it's all right.

                          LUCY
           It must be costing a week's wages.

                          COLIN
           It's worth it.
           LUCY can't help being charmed.

                         LIONEL
               Kurt. It's Lionel. I'm locked out.

     As Lionel slides down the length of the door into a sit he
     unfolds the flyer he was just handed. It's a rendering of Sam
     White on a carton of milk with the caption:

               embroiled in protest. And he's only
               half Black.

     Lionel walks alone through the buzzing campus. He looks out
     to..

     ...a group of BLACK KIDS. He sees a version of himself
     amongst them - his hair a finger waved Ceasar fade, as he
     trades "No Homo's" with the others.

     Lionel shakes it off. Peers over to a group of out and proud
     gay kids and sees a version of himself amongst them - his
     hair straightened and coifed in a fitted shirt laughing.

     Not right either. Where does he fit? By surprise...

                         GEORGE
               Lionel right?

     GEORGE PIERCE, 24, an intellectual whose tattooed quotes from

                is like jazz. I don't know much
                about jazz. But from what I can
                tell, when your solo's up, you
                better blow.

          Loud JAZZ plays. Back home, Walter is living a Man's, Man's
          World. He's partying, drinking and dancing with two cute
          HIPPIE CHICKS in bikinis.
          The place is like a WAREHOUSE, Keane PRINTS stacked everywhere.

                          HIPPIE CHICK
           Shit, this is crazy! All these
           copies... you're like Warhol!

                          WALTER
           Nah, Warhol's like me. That fruitfly
           stole my act! "The Factory"? I had a
           factory before he had a soup can!
          The girls scrunch their faces, lost.
          Then -- DING-DONG! Walter peeks out the window, then grins.

                          WALTER
           Ah! It's my art supplies.

          INT. PAINTING ROOM - SECONDS LATER

          Alone, Walter eagerly pries open a GIANT CRATE. He pulls out
          padding. Wadded Honolulu newspapers. Then... a PAINTING.
          Ah! A new WAIF, surrounded by colorful tropical plants.
          Walter smiles triumphantly -- until -- his happiness melts
          into confusion. Then horror.
          We ZOOM INTO the painting's SIGNATURE. It says "MDH Keane."
          Walter freaks.

          Petulia. I mean it. Tubas. All this
          E "I Love Lucy" jazz. It's only cute for
          awhile.

          PETULIA
          It's not meant to be cute. I'm
          fighting for your life.

          I really don't want to see you anymore.

          mostly by May. She gets up and leaves.

          ARCHIE
          Petulia, you've got to stop following
          me around like this.
          Petulia is absolutely silent but her eyes are devouring
          him with infinite tenderness which Archie is finding
          very touching. It is a facet of Petulia he has never
          seen before.

          ARCHIE
          Where to? I could use a steak sandwich.
          There's a jazz joint that stays open
          all night.
          He reaches to start the car just as she grabs at him,
          • awkwardly, aggressively.

          ARCHIE

          (SURPRISED)
          Hey, come on ®m why this sudden
          Petulia is relentless and voracious. Her hands and mouth
          are everywhere on Archie. A car is a lousy bedroom but
          it will have to do. Heads bump against windows, elbows
          jam against steering wheels, but Petulia will not be
          stopped. Finally, Archie grips her shoulders and forces
          her to stop.

          ARCHIE
          No.

          PETULIA
          Yes.

                       Woody Allen



As the last credit appears, the song ends in a crescendo and
the screen fades to total black.

Immediately, a new melody begins, an uptempo jazz number, as
a title appears on the screen.

                  "God, she's beautiful..."

                                            CUT TO:

INT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

A full face of Lee, wearing a gray sweater and leaning
against the dining room doorway.  She gazes into the camera
with a half-smile on her face as Elliot speaks over the
screen.

                         ELLIOT (V.O.)
            God, she's beautiful.

Lee glances over her shoulder, then turns from the doorway
and walks away.  The camera follows her, moving across a
book-and-photograph-filled bookshelf that obscures her from
view as she walks into a crowded, comfortable vestibule.
People, some holding drinks, some just entering the
apartment, surround her.  Everyone is talking at once,
carrying on easy, familiar conversation.

                         ELLIOT (V.O.)
            She's got the prettiest eyes, and
            she looks so sexy in that sweater.

Lee smiles at the various people, exchanging greetings.

EXT. BEVERLY HILLS BOULEVARD - DAY

Norman, a Los Angeles TV producer and Mickey's former
partner, is driving down a peaceful street lined with palm
trees.  He's wearing sunglasses and headphones.  He clicks
his fingers in time to the music only he hears on his
Walkman.  He's smiling contentedly while Mickey talks over
the sun-filled scene.  The continuous background jazz plays
louder.

                         MICKEY (V.O.)
            Christ, this show is ruining my

As Mickey finishes his ruminations, Hannah is seen walking
towards her front door.  She opens it, her back to the

jazz stops.

            You're kidding me.

                         MICKEY
                   (overlapping)
            I've done no television whatsoever.
            No.

As Mickey continues to speak, Holly walks to another bin of
records, reacting to his words.  She looks offscreen at him,
then down at some records.  The camera follows her.

                         MICKEY
                   (offscreen, continuing)
            I may, I may have to get back into
            it, 'cause my accountant says that
            I'm running out of dollars.
            But...but, um, no, I haven't, I
            just sort of dropped out for a
            year...

                         HOLLY
                   (overlapping, nodding)
            Oh.  Oh.

                         MICKEY
                   (offscreen, overlapping)
            ...which is a long, dull story and
            I won't get into it.  But--

Mickey walks back onscreen to Holly.  The two of them are
partially obscured by a large white Jazz sign imprinted with
a large red circle as they continue their conversation.

                         HOLLY
                   (interrupting)
            You're okay, though, huh?

                         MICKEY
            I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm
            fine.  How are you?

                         HOLLY
                   (face offscreen,
                   obscured by the sign)
            Oh, I'm fine.

                         MICKEY
            What...what about your script?
                   (face offscreen

            So what's it about?

                   (face offscreen)
            Well, I'd love it if you'd read it,
            actually, 'cause I really would
            value your opinion.

                         MICKEY
                   (face offscreen)
            You have to remember, we-we-we
            didn't agree on one thing.

They emerge from behind the Jazz sign, still walking, still
talking.

                         HOLLY
                   (smiling, gesturing)
            But you have to remember while
            you're reading and you're cursing
            my name, you know, that this is my
            first script.  Well, it's not my
            first script.

                         MICKEY
            Hmm.

                         HOLLY
                   (touching her face)
            Actually, my first script was about
            Hannah and her husband, but, uh...

                         MICKEY
            Yeah.

            ...who as you once said, I love
            much more than I realized.

After pausing for a moment on Elliot's face, the film cuts
to the foyer, where two boys and a girl gather by the door.
One boy opens it, revealing Holly.  She joyfully enters the
apartment, greeting each child with an enthusiastic kiss.

                         HOLLY
                   (kissing the children)
            Hi!  How are you!

            Happy Thanksgiving!
                   (kissing)

            Hi!

            No!

The jazz ends as the record scratches and stops.  Evan's
rendition of "Isn't It Romantic" is heard on the piano as
Holly, shrugging the strap of her pocketbook off her
shoulder, walks towards the living room.  She is stopped by
three guests--two women, one of them wearing glasses, and a
man--who are coming out of the room.

                         HOLLY

                   (overlapping)
            You look lovely.

They kiss.

He stole her virginity. He took it away and now it's gone forever.

Laughter.

JENNIE
Yeah. But it's not even the fact that he devirginized me. It's the fact that after it was done he never spoke to me again. He talked all this bullshit and then just broke out.

LINDA
That's the kinda shit he's into. Telly is known for that stuff. He fucked Amber the same way.

SUSAN
And Susan too.

JENNIE
But he was all like, Oh Jennie I like you so much. Trust me you'll love it, I'm not gonna use you. I promise. He was poppin mad jazz.

More laughter from the group.

They all speak very quickly, almost to the point where you can't understand them.

SUSAN
First times are always wacked. Just be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car.

RUBY
That shit is nothin. I remember, I had just turned 14. With this fuckin asshole who was like 18. I don't even remember his name. I think it was John or Jake or something. I remember he had a brother named Lentil because I would always joke and call him Lentil Bean. This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit.

JENNIE
Oh yeah.

Laughter.

RUBY
And we did it in the bush. Like outside around midnight. I got fucking mosquito bits all over my ass. And we thought everyone was sleeping, but they obviously weren't because everybody knew. And it was out on the grass somewhere. And it hurt like a motha, oh my god the pain!

Laughter.

    Stare at my broken face in a gilded mirror. The breaks
    occurred a lifetime ago, healed uneven. I wear a white
    tropical button-down, a Republican-gold Rolex, a pirate-patch
    over what was my left eye.

    I reach into a dresser drawer, pull out a yellowed black &amp;

    me is a week-old L.A. Times with the headline: Matriarch of

1   INT. HILLSIDE VILLA - MORNING                                 1

    Stare at my broken face in a gilded mirror. The breaks
    occurred a lifetime ago, healed uneven. I wear a white
    tropical button-down, a Republican-gold Rolex, a pirate-patch
    over what was my left eye.

                        ME (V.O.)
              I'm old. And all I have left is the
              will to remember...

    I reach into a dresser drawer, pull out a yellowed black &amp;
    white picture of HER: this beatific blonde, sleeping. Below
    me is a week-old L.A. Times with the headline: Matriarch of
    Television Series, Empire Ridge, Retires.

    The Matriarch's picture in the middle.                            *

                        ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
              ...and the fear I'll forget...

    Slide HER over the Matriarch's picture: the Matriarch 30
    years younger now. Lift my eyes back to my reflection.

               Someone from the Times will call

          Glenda: twenty-five years avoiding
          her name. Only a photograph,
          yellowed with years-passed,
          reminding me of everything I never
          was.
               (beat)
          Then a week-old Times at the place
          I buy coffee. Her picture sees me
          before I realize she's looking. Her
          Face eternal-beautiful...

Put her photo in my chest pocket. Push the week-old Times
into a waste-basket: a Pan-Am ticket to LA underneath.

                    ME (V.O.)
          ...and it asked me to revoke our
          time apart, redeem it...tell her
          anything...tell her everything...

I stand, shatter the mirror that reminds me of how long. And
as I step out, an old man twenty-five years too late, and my
MGM-handsome, 1958 face smiles back at me through the shards.

                         or not?

                         I dunno... because I can't stand the 
                         idea of a world where a guy like you 
                         can't get a date...

               Enid finds a PAINTING leaning in a pile of stuff against the 
               wall in the corner. It's an old-fashioned cartoony stereotype 
               of a black man's head, with big lips and a huge toothy smile.

                                     ENID

                         this?

     The restaurant's demographic has changed. It's now younger
     stragglers wandering in. Sebastian looks beyond bored. He
     finishes "We Wish You a Merry Christmas". Zero applause.

     He begins a new chart: "Deck the Halls". But something seems
     to come over him now. He's restless. Slowly, his playing
     drifts off -- his fingers charting their own path...

     And then -- we hear a melody. The one Mia heard outside. The
     one we'll refer to from now on as Mia and Sebastian's song...

     The door opens -- and Mia steps in. She sees Sebastian at the
     piano. Is instantly struck by his playing. [MIA AND

               Most people say they hate jazz because

               packed into flophouses in New Orleans,

          they'd play at cocktail parties whenever

          It's not cocktail music -- it's a high-

                       SEBASTIAN
          It's gotta be Van Beek. I can't let them
          samba all over its history.

                       MIA
          Make your own history.

Sebastian looks at her. Appreciates that line. A beat. Then --

                       SEBASTIAN
          Your play's incredible.

Mia smiles. He approaches her, sits by her side.

95   INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT COMPLEX / APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Mia walks through the courtyard. Reaches the door. Then hears
     something... Music -- LOUD, FAST JAZZ...

     She enters -- has to jostle the door handle to do so --

     -- and then freezes in place. Sebastian is sashaying around a
     fully-decked table, lighting candles as he moves. He looks
     up, sees her -- and grins.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                  Surprise.

     She lights up. He lifts up silver serving trays, revealing
     what he's cooked. Roast chicken. Pasta.

                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
                  And...
                         (he hurries to the kitchen --
                          and holds up a big apple pie)
                  There's twenty-five pounds of apples in
                  it. It probably destroyed an ecosystem
                  but it tastes good.

     Mia laughs. Can't believe it. Sebastian looks at her --
     sincere now.

                               SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
                  I have to head back in the morning but I
                  needed to see you.

     Mia's eyes seem almost on the brink of tears. Beyond moved,
     she runs into Sebastian's arms. A LONG, HEARTFELT KISS...

96   INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - EVENING

     CLOSE ON: The record player. An old jazz track. We see Mia and
     Sebastian seated at the table -- eating, drinking, laughing.

                               SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
                  Feels so good to be home.

                                 MIA

          I've got to follow my own plan. Stay

A moment. Mia nods. Sebastian looks at her again.

                       SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
          You're going to be in Paris. Good jazz
          there. And you love jazz now.

Mia smiles.

                       SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)

          I guess we're just going to have to wait
          and see.

Mia's eyes well up, just slightly, as she hears this. She
nods.

          You know I'm always going to love you.

131   INT. JAZZ CLUB - DAY

      ...a small jazz club. Simple, tasteful, cool. Stone arches in
      1940's style. The seats close to the band, the piano in the
      center. The club has the same old-school character as the
      Lighthouse -- but it's not run-down. It's polished, inviting.

      The place is empty save for Sebastian and an EMPLOYEE. It's
      before-hours. Sebastian finishes playing. Feels out the
      lowest keys once more, then the highest. Then turns and --

                             SEBASTIAN
                Alright, I'm done.

           A typically lame college party, still early in the night. The
           furniture is "student budget modern" type. A jazz record
           plays quietly, while pretentiously-dressed PARTY-GOERS sip
           wine and eat cheese and crackers.

             I was talking to him, Pogo.

                        CATCH
          No thanks, Ray. Everything's code
          four. Go away.

Sharon laughs aloud and walks (with Catch in hand) to the
police car, her joy overwhelming any embarrassment. She
gestures behind them at the jazz club.

                        SHARON
          See that place? He's going to be
          playing there every weekend.

Catch notes the pride with which she says this.

                        RAY
                 (impressed; to Catch)
          Oh, yeah? What d'you play?

                        SHARON
          It's music, Ray. You wouldn't
          like it.

She waves and walks off with Catch, arms around each
other. The cops watch them go.

     IN THE BACKYARD -EVENING

     Jules tours Nic around the backyard, looking a little freaked
     out as she shows her the work she's been doing.

                         JULES
               I'm gonna do some planting over
               there so it won't look so bare...

                         NIC
               It looks great, honey. Very
               indigenous. I'm so proud of you.

     Nic kisses Jules spontaneously. Jules looks nauseous again.
     They head back up the stairs, toward Paul's house.
                         NIC (CONT'D)
               Hey, so how's that guy Luis working
               out?
