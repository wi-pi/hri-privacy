          Photographs of a long-forgotten vacation in Puerto Rico
          with Debbie. A Baseball glove.
          A high-school year book. Inside, a page of senior photos.
          He finds his own picture smiling at the thresh-hold of

          graffitied with hand-written messages from classmates
          including : "Henry don't be such a fag, Eddie Vibes"
          Henry puts the yearbook back in the box. Next to it are a

Michael and Bussetta are driven in a Mercury sedan, making

CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL

looking out the window.

MICHAEL'S POV

Crowded streets, occasional roving bands playing for the
tourists; there is much evidence of tourism: Americans
walking through the streets with cameras.  Occasionally, we
see a Cuban with a row of numbers attached to his hat,
carrying a big sheet of the daily lottery numbers.  From all
of these street impressions, the city is booming with
activity, but there is also much evidence of whores and
pimps and little children begging in the streets.

MED. VIEW

The big American car stops at an intersection.  Bussetta is
sitting in the forward passenger side; while Michael is in
the back.  He hears tapping on the window; he turns and sees
four Cuban boys tapping on his window and extending their
hands, and rubbing their stomachs as though they were hungry.
The Cuban driver rolls down his window and shouts them away
in Spanish.

                                 FABRIZIO

Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!

The table explodes into shouting in several languages. Jack rakes in the
money and the tickets.

                              (to the Swedes)

Sorry boys. Three of a kind and a pair. I'm high and you're dry and...

                               (to Fabrizio)

Olaf balls up one huge farmer's fist. We think he's going to clobber Jack,
but he swings round and punches Sven, who flops backward onto the floor and
sits there, looking depressed. Olaf forgets about Jack and Fabrizio, who
are dancing around, and goes into a rapid harangue of his stupid cousin.

Jack kisses the tickets, then jumps on Fabrizio's back and rides him around
the pub. It's like they won the lottery.

                                   JACK

Goin' home... to the land o' the free and the home of the real hot-dogs! On

royalty, ragazzo mio!!

numbers as Boss Tweed gives out with a speech.

BOSS TWEED
Your honor... yes, and the law of the land... lies in the balance. The
Conscription Act of 1863 was handed down by President Lincoln himself ...

A YOUNG MEMBER of the crowd steps forward as Boss Tweed turns to look at
those backing him on the platform: Killoran, a CAVALRY OFFICER in fancy
dress ... and, out of sight of the crowd, Johnny Sirocco. Their
expressions are not reassuring.
