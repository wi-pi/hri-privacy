          The bus slows to a stop in the middle of the road.
          In the distance, blue lights flash in front of a road block.
          A few people gather.

                          DRIVER
           Y'all stay put. Let me find out
           what's going on.
          As the driver gets up, a WLBT-TV news truck whizzes by
          followed by a police motorcycle. Aibileen leans in the aisle
          and looks ahead.
          The driver returns. The young black man speaks up.

           YOUNG BLACK MAN
           What happen up there, Mister?

                          DRIVER
           Colored people off. White people
           lemme know where y'all are going.
           I'll get you as close as I can.

           80.

                         
          As the young black man helps Aibileen down the aisle, a white
          passenger taps the driver on the shoulder.

                          WHITE PASSENGER
           What's going on?
          Aibileen and the young man walk down the stairs.

          There is a faint noise. Larry hears it first and then Phil
          and then, as they strain to identify it, they see a tiny
          dot on the road ahead of them, which grows and grows as
          they watch it, and they peer hard into the wind to identify
          it and... it's a motorcycle cop.

                         front of the car!

          the car tears loose and flies backwards, smashing into the
          cop's motorcycle, leaving him holding the radio and its

The BAR GIRL comes around the corner with NICK, guiding him
to a flight of narrow stairs. She has one hand around his
waist and the other down the front of his pants.

			BAR GIRL
	You like to call me Linda now?

			NICK 
	Linda, yeah.

			BAR GIRL 
	You call me Linda, just like home.

Suddenly NICK draws to a stop, staring at a small window at
the end of the corridor. He tears himself loose from the BAR
GIRL and pushes up against the glass.

EXT. NARROW STREET (NICK'S POV) - NIGHT

Seated on the sidewalk against the wall of the opposite
building is an OLD MAN surrounded by a collection of white
ceramic elephants. A truck roars by in front of him.
Motorcycles sputter past and PEDESTRIANS hurry in both
directions. The OLD MAN sits motionless, like the guardian of
some timeless, silent kingdom.

INT. CORRIDOR - BAR - NIGHT

NICK spins away from the window.

			NICK

          Lisbeth, this is Martin Vanger.

                        MARTIN
          How do you do.
                         SALANDER
          Fine.
She comes past them without another word. Martin can't
help noticing her wasp and handcuff tattoos. Looks after
her as she disappears into the cottage. It's hard to
believe, but he has to ask:

                         MARTIN
          Girlfriend?

                 That's comforting. Are you hungry?

                 No.
       Busy setting up her laptop on his desk, starting it up,
       sitting down at it, she's all but ignoring him.
                               BLOMKVIST
                 I used to have a motorcycle.    When I
                 was 19.

                               SALANDER
                 I know.
       She hands him her own dog-eared Bible and a copy of the
       list of names and initials he gave her -

                               SALANDER
                 The five cases from Harriet's

                 three I'm sure about.

       Five more? Blomkvist stares at her but she's turned back
       to her laptop, bringing up police reports and crime scene
       photos.

       Salander browses through an iPhoto album of old
       photographs of Blomkvist and the motorcycle he mentioned.
       In some of them, Erika is with him. In all of them, he's
       wearing a leather jacket not unlike Salander's.

       He's just woken up in a tangle of blankets on the couch
       to see her at his laptop. She closes the album, leaving
       on the screen what she was looking at before: his iMovie
       of the parade and some annotated police files.

                  I'm going to have to go to Norsjo.

       He opens the door to leave and sees on the porch -
       The charred corpse of the cat. Its legs - sawn off and
       arranged in the shape of a swastika - lie in the middle
       of a dark circle of blood.

       He seems too startled to move, but when Salander sees
       it, she immediately gets her camera and begins framing
       close-ups of the cat parts, and its head resting atop
       the seat of her motorcycle.

       Blomkvist stares off at Harald's house ...

      a torn piece of his shirt to his bleeding head - and
      almost gasps.

     a bag of groceries as well.  They are all singing and moving
     with the jaunty step of the newly carefree.  Katie spots a

     HALABY is tough -- his denim, his leather, his bike, his long

     George is on the floor with Matt and Katie, playing War.
     Katie points to the Harley emblem on his leather jacket.

     Erin's in bed, hooked up to an IV, looking exhausted.  All
     untouched food tray is beside her bed.  George is standing
     across the room from her, arms crossed tight across his
     chest, keeping his distance.

                               ERIN
            They said that'd be tomorrow.  They just
            wanna keep an eye on me another night.

                               GEORGE
            Fine.  I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.

     A moment of thick silence.

                               ERIN
            Thank you.

                               GEORGE
                        (giving nothing)
            Mm-hm.

     As she watches him reach for his motorcycle helmet, to leave,
     she's hit with a wave of regret.

                               ERIN
            George, hang on.
                        (he pauses)
            Look ... I'm sorry.  I just --

     There's a KNOCK at the door, and Ed enters.  George looks at
     him.  Not interested in her apologies.

                               GEORGE
            I'll drop 'em by tomorrow.

     And Erin watches George leave the room, then turns to Ed.

                               ERIN
            If you're here to fire me, your timing's
            lousy.

            I'm not gonna fire you.
                        (beat)
            I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and
            that woulda made me look like a shit.

            You embarrassed me, Erin.

The street level of the office building is filthy and houses

windows and a big sign saying "Office Space For Rent" along

INT. OFFICE ON SIXTH FLOOR
    
Two men are in the room, JOE and ED. Joe leans up against a
rack of filing cabinets. He is in his late twenties. He
looks like a run down, heavy metal rocker - wears a blue
denim shirt open, T-shirt underneath, black denim jeans and
motorcycle boots. His black belt has silver studs. He's
smoking a cigarette and is laughing at something the man at
the desk has said. His laugh is easy and his grin is
infectious.
    
The man at the desk, Ed, wears a clean, crisp black suit,
like a business man's but unlike a business man his blonde
hair is long enough to go over his shoulders.

          The overpass's collapsed section is now just a MOUNTAINOUS
          PILE OF RUBBLE that leads down to the road below.
          
          Eli steps onto the rubble. About to make his way down when he
          FREEZES. He hears something. The faintest of sounds. He takes
          cover, peering down at the road beneath the overpass to see:
          
          TWO PEOPLE walking together on the road. We see everything
          from ELI'S P.O.V. - too far to make out much detail, but
          apparently it is a MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE.
          
          The man pushes along an OLD WHEELBARROW covered by a tarp as
          the woman, seemingly his wife, walks alongside. The barrow's
          rusted wheel gives out a plaintive, rhythmic SQUEAK.
          
          Eli ducks down again as he hears something else. This time
          much louder. The menacing growl of MOTORCYCLE ENGINES.
          
          FOUR BIKES IN TOTAL. Riding out of the horizon, closing in on
          the couple. They see the bikes coming and panic. Try
          desperately to steer the barrow off the road.
          
          The bikes screech to a halt and the FOUR RIDERS dismount.
          Brandishing a variety of weapons. The couple make a run for
          it but they're quickly chased down and tackled to the ground.
          
          The woman SCREAMS and struggles helplessly as the bikers
          swarm over the man like a pack of predatory animals.
          
          The woman is pulled to the ground and the clothes stripped
          from her. Eli turns away. He knows what comes next.

          They ferret through the items, scavenging a few items - we
          don't see what - and stuffing them into an old cloth satchel.
          They leave the rest strewn in the road and ride off in the
          direction they came, dust pluming in their wake.
          
                                                                 14.

          a cross over their ravaged bodies as he mutters a prayer
          under his breath. Then stands and continues on down the road.

          Behind the main counter a convoluted Rube Goldberg-esque
          STILL is running. An ENGINEER in a leather apron pours the
          remnants of a can of motor oil into the still's funnel.
          
          Attached to the still is an old MOTORCYCLE MIRROR. In its
          reflection the engineer sees Eli checking out the store.
          
          Without turning around, he reaches surreptitiously behind the
          counter for something.
          
          Eli turns toward the counter - to find the engineer training
          a PUMP-ACTION SHOTGUN right at him.

          As the assembled townsfolk disperse, FOUR MOTORCYCLES roar
          into town and pull up outside the Palladium.
          
          As the riders dismount, one detaches a CLOTH SATCHEL from his
          bike's cargo rack. The four riders head inside. They each
          have long, straggly hair and brutish expressions.
          
          We recognize them now as the BIKER BANDITS who killed the
          couple on the road under the freeway overpass.

isn't so drunk that he doesn't sense what this is about.
He looks behind him. Indeed, the other two goons are
there. Ashoka straddles the big cycle.

Knowing what's  coming, Max nevertheless unleashes a

in the nose, nailing Hasari to the wall as Max collapses
at Hasari's feet. Hasari grabs his nose with one hand
and kneels beside the fallen Max... as a shadow moves
and startles Hasari. He peers into the dark... and
Poomina steps into the light.

WITH ASHOKA
He pulls the boy's ear, REVS the ENGINE to go... and
senses someone close. He turns to find an American
hovering at his shoulder.
                       MAX
         You know, I have to say you
         really don't look Jewish. I
         believe that's mine.

He reaches for the necklace with the Hebrew letter.
Ashoka recognizes Max. Looks around for help. There is
none.

         scarring will be minimal.

EXT. OUTSIDE CYBERDELIA. NIGHT.

        Kate and Curtis are sucking face, oblivious to the busy
        world around them. Dade and Phreak watch, more than a
        little disgusted.

                                DADE
                    Who's that?

                                PHREAK
                    That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks
                    slick all day.

        Kate and Curtis start to take off on Curtis' motorcycle.
        Kate and Dade make eye contact briefly. The motorcycle
        speeds off into the night.

INT. DADE'S ROOM.

        The clock says it's 4:16. As the camera pans up to Dade,
        it changes to 4:17. Dade is hacking again. It's the
        school's administration system. Dade schedules a test of
        the school sprinkler system for 9:30am.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDIR.

        Dade stands alone in the hall, watching the time closely.
        Phreak rounds a corner and meets Dade.

                                PHREAK
                    What's up?

        Dade doesn't answer. He watches the time a couple of more
        seconds, then opens an umbrella. Immediately the fire
        sprinklers turn on. Phreak starts getting drenched. He
        realizes what is happening.

                                PHREAK
                                (amused and highly impressed)
        Oh my God. You...

        A bell rings and students pour out into the halls by the
        hundreds. They're all being showered on. A tall
        cheerleader bounces by Phreak, pushing her pom-pom in his
        face.

          My guess is that he lives close to
          where he's making the calls, and it
          makes sense he'd be living in
          Rawalpindi because there's an Al

          INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY CIA SECTION - BRIEFING ROOM

          We focus on a MAP of Pakistan on the wall. Maya is indicating
          neighborhoods in Rawalpindi. She's briefing Bradley, Hakim,
          Larry and a few other people.

                         MAYA
          It would be convenient for him to
          drop tapes off if he's sending either
          from bin Laden or from an
          intermediary. When he wants to make
          a call, he leaves the house, walks a
          few blocks, then switches on the
          phone. We need to keep canvassing
          the neighborhood until we find him.

          Larry is at the wheel, moving slowly through a dangerous
          part of town. The streets narrow.
          Two motorcycles suddenly pull around in front of Larry's van
          and stop. The riders pull out guns.

          Larry tries reversing but a compact car wheels in right behind
          them, and Larry slams on the brakes. The TECH raises an M4.

          The boys spring up, speaking in terrified whispers.

          They race up a nearby ladder, but Michael stumbles against a
          table, upsetting some gear. It clatters loudly. They cower
          as they hear boots tromping up the steps outside. Then the
          windmill doors are thrown open, pinning them in the bright
          headlights of the vehicles.
                         
          As they're marched out, we see what they see: A German car -
          two motorcycles. Six Germans, including the officer who was
          in charge of them.

she hits "select all" and "delete" --

ON THE COMPUTER - A BLANK DOCUMENT. She types: "Hi Mom,
things are great, grades are up. Hanging with friends.
Stop worrying. I'm fine."

Bella presses "send", and the cheery e-mail disappears.
Bella rises, returns to her rocking chair, staring out

Bella exits to find Charlie out by the street, stuffing
trash into the bins. He talks with neighbor, Bob Marks, who
also attends to his trash: two old, beat up motorcycles.           

                          CHARLIE
              It's about time you got rid of those,
              Bob. Seen one too many bikers smeared
              on the highway.

                          BOB
              Save the lecture, Chief. Soon as the
              garbage truck hauls `em off, you and
              my wife can rest easy.
                    (starts off, but stops)
              Oh, hey, what's the word on that bear

The apparition of EDWARD REAPPEARS in her path this time.           
She stops.

                          EDWARD
              Turn around, Bella.     This is

              Stop.   Now.

to see them clearly -- and stops, realizing --

              ... You're not them.

dilapidated, rusting MOTORCYCLES.

                          JACOB
              Scrap metal. You shouldn't have.

                          BELLA
              I rescued them from the dump. They'd
              cost more than they're worth to fix...
              unless one had a mechanic-type friend.
                          JACOB
              Me, being the mechanic-type friend?
                   (off her shrug)
              Since when are you into motorcycles?

                          BELLA
              Recently.

                          JACOB
                   (studying the bikes)
              The parts alone will be pricey.

                          BELLA
              I have a college fund I can dig into.

Tim bursts from the tree-line, he's almost to the pavement,       
he`s going to escape --                                           

BAM! Something YANKS him out of frame at an unnatural             
angle. His SCREAM is abruptly choked off, leaving nothing

              If we're going to be working on this
              every day, we should probably include
              some homework. Don't want the Dads to
              think I'm a bad influence on you.

Bella drives along the La Push cliffs. Jacob rides shotgun.
He studies a grease-blackened motorcycle crankshaft.

                          JACOB
              We got lucky at the dump. You know
              how much a new crankshaft goes for?

                          BELLA
              Sure, I spend all my free time on
              crankshaft-dot-com.

                          JACOB
              Scary as hell, but a total rush.

BELLA'S POV - A DIVER (Paul) takes a running start and           
FLINGS himself into the air, twisting and cartwheeling down.

Bella is intrigued, sees the potential for adrenaline - for      
Edward.

There's that bitter edge again.   She looks at him.

                 You look scared.

                            BELLA
                 I'm not.

She's lying. PULL BACK to see she's straddling the now
completed motorcycle. Jacob stands next to her, holding the
bike up. There's an intimacy to their proximity. INCLUDE --

EXT. LA PUSH - CLEARING IN THE FOREST (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

The bike is aimed down a dirt road.     Jacob runs through the     
instructions:

                          JACOB
               Brake?
                    (she taps it)

               Right. Gas?
                    (she grips it)
               You ready?

Bella nods.   Jacob grins... then KICK-STARTS the bike.

                           JACOB
              Bank it!   Bank - hit the brake!

Jacob races toward her. She reaches the turn, doesn't bank,
goes straight... and flies right into a wall of trees.

As she lies on the ground dazed, Jacob hurries up.

                          JACOB
              What, are you training for the X-games?

She looks around for Edward.   He's gone.

                          BELLA
              I want to go again.

                          JACOB
              Forget it. I'm revoking your                       
              motorcycle privileges. Man, look at

Indeed, blood drips down her forehead. He pulls off his          
shirt to mop it up. She shrinks away --                          

                          BELLA

              You're apologizing for bleeding?

                          JACOB
              It's just blood, Bella.

He bends over her, carefully tending her head. She finds
herself looking at him. His dark eyes, his bare chest and        
smooth skin. He glances at her.

              where to look. Is there something I
              should see -- ?

              No, that's too dangerous --

way. Beat.

              The motorcycles - that clearing in the              
              woods.                                              
He nods slowly, then turns to go.    She stops him.

              Don't go. There are dangerous things                
              out there; more than you know.                      

He looks at her with a wry smile. Then pulls her into a           
hug. Her cheek against his bare chest. She takes in the           
closeness... then he soundlessly heads out her door. A beat
-- Bella starts pulling on clothes.

               A dirty bar hidden away on a dark street, its cracked, moon-
               white sign the only evidence it exists.

               Corky's truck swings into a space in front of a couple of 
               large motorcycles.  She flips her collar and heads for the 
               door.

               INT.  THE WATERING HOLE - NIGHT

               The smell of leather and cigarette smoke fills Corky's nose

               Corky sits as the fat bartender waddles over.

               VROOM! Outside a roaring MOTORCYCLE comes to a stop. Then 
               over the sound of an IDLING ENGINE come familiar if indistinct 
               VOICES and LAUGHTER.

               Miles opens his bleary eyes and listens.

               FOOTSTEPS pound on the balcony outside, and Jack lets himself 
               in, flushed and exuberant.

               He pounds on the wall, then goes into the bathroom and without 
               closing the door unzips his pants to PEE.

                         Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty

                         your system. Congratulations. Mission 
                         accomplished.

               A hungover Miles gets up and looks out the door Jack has 
               left open. Down in the parking lot he sees --

               STEPHANIE

               atop a mid-sized MOTORCYCLE, wearing a weathered fringed 
               suede jacket. She gives him a big friendly wave.

               MILES

               returns the wave and goes back inside.

                                     MILES
                         You didn't invite Stephanie to come

               With a FLUSH Jack emerges from the bathroom and opens his

                         off today, so she and I are going on

DUKE and GONZO are up and off.  The DWARF chases after them
with the (very large) check in his hand.

They sweep out through the Lounge door, unaware of it
swinging back into the face of the pursuing DWARF.

            I tell you, my man.  This is the

topping off oil in the forks, last minute bolt tightening.

DUKE wanders through.

            gives me a lot of crap about it, so

            "cover this race" in any
            conventional press sense was absurd.

A HORN HONKS.  A shiny BLACK BRONCO with DRIVER.  LACERDA
hangs out of the window.

                         LACERDA
            It's great, isn't it?!  Jump in!

DUKE gets into the Bronco and they head into the DUST CLOUD.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

IN THE BRONCO.

DUKE hangs on with his beer.  Nothing all around but the
HUGE IMPENETRABLE CLOUD OF DUST.  LACERDA snaps madly away
at nothing at all!

EXT. DESERT - DAY

IN THE BRONCO.

DUKE hangs on with his beer.  Nothing all around but the
HUGE IMPENETRABLE CLOUD OF DUST.  LACERDA snaps madly away
at nothing at all!

            I'll just keep trying different
            combos of film and lenses till I
            find one that works in this dust!

The SOUND OF MOTORCYCLES RACING...

We hear music and voices singing:

                         BATTLE HYMN
            "...As we go marching on
            When I reach my final campground,
            in
            that land beyond the sun,
            And the Great Commander asks me..."
            [What did he ask you, Rusty?]
            "Did you fight or did you run?"

A moment later, the Bronco races out of the dust.  DUKE
coughs, chokes, drinks beer.

                         BATTLE HYMN
                   (continuing)
            [And what did you tell them,
            Rusty?]
            "We responded to their rifle fire
            with everything we had..."

The sound of gun shots...

A DUNE BUGGY races toward them, loaded down with THREE
RETIRED PETTY OFFICERS, DRUNK AS HELL.  The radio blares:
"THE BATTLE HYMN OF LIEUTENANT CALLEY."

The dune buggy is COVERED WITH OMINOUS SYMBOLS: SCREAMING
EAGLES CARRYING AMERICAN FLAGS IN THEIR CLAWS.  A slant-eyed
Snake being chopped to bits by a buzz-saw made of stars and
stripes.  A MACHINE GUN MOUNT on the passenger side.  They
yell over the roaring engines.

                         DUNE BUGGY DRIVER
            Where's the damn race?

	          Wonder filled the night with his resounding tones. 
	          And on October 30th of 1938, he became what he felt 
	          destined to be: a household name.
	
	What started out as a roguish Halloween prank became the most famous 
	radio show in the history of the galaxy!
	
	Images of the WAR OF THE WORLDS broadcast and panic: listeners huddling

          swings his bat, trying to stave off the Stone General.
          Suddenly - THUNK!
          A circular OBSIDIAN BLADE lands in his wooden bat. He looks

          and punches at their pursuer when he closes in.
          The chase takes them to a PARKING GARAGE as they circle

          gang jackets, black leather vests... Big guys...

          What can I say, Lorn, I've got a
          soft spot for redheads. Why do you
          think I married you?

          The divorce papers called it
          temporary insanity.

          Lucky for you there was a cure.

1. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

A MAN rides a screaming massive Japanese motorcycle - wound out to 
maximum R.P.M. up the street.

								CUT TO:


2. SIGN BY ROADSIDE

The sign reads �KIDS PLAYING - SPEED BUMPS�.

								CUT TO:


3. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

With a whine from hell, the front tire of the motorcycle hits a speed 
bump.

The motorcycle becomes airborne and on the way up slices itself in half 
as it scrapes along the full length of a Datsun Kingcab.

In the air, the rider and motorcycle twist violently as they fly by.

The motorcycle bounces off a black �66 Chevrolet and makes a sound like 
the end of the world.

The rider hits the same Chevy a moment later.  Like a broken ragdoll 
shot from a canon, the man punches through the back window blowing glass 
for a block.  He stops somewhere under the front seat and a bubble of 
blood forms out his nose.

The motorcycle continues on sliding and spinning with an ear-piercing 
howl for one entire city block.

          As the two Becker jetvans arrive at a restricted area, a

          then park.

          art as much as they are demons of speed.
