INT. TWENTY ONE CLUB WASHROOM - NIGHT

Hunsecker and Sidney are washing in adjoining basins.  Coat
off, the former is in one of his punitive moods of silence.
Sidney, despite his throbbing, bandaged finger, is feeling
satisfied and self-confident.  He hums quietly.  Hunsecker
throws him annoyed side-glances, but Sidney refuses to
"catch on".  The following dialogue is spaced between the
washing, the drying and hair-combing.

                         HUNSECKER

            My mother's side--her brother.
            That reminds me, J.J., Susie looks
            run down.  She can stand a vacation
            and so can you.  People say, "Oh,
            the great J.J., he's made of
            iron!", but you can use a rest, guy.

Sidney's cheerfulness annoys Hunsecker.

Then. Something. At the far stall. A pair of men's
shoes. Black. Polished. Facing the stall door.
Waiting...

           Okay.
                         
           She kisses him. Opens up his shirt. Reveals a severely
           bruised torso. He winces a bit from the movement. She
           redresses his wounds, nursing him back to health.
                         
                          CINDY
           That motherfucker.
                         
           She kisses his chest. Dean starts getting underneath Cindy's
           clothes. He places his palm on her belly.
                         
                          DEAN

		Now do I know when?

	He reaches.  First time.  Strokes her hair.

				LUKE
		That moment will come.  And your
		heart is going to whisper, 'here
		it is'

	Winds his fingers.  Around her hand.

				LUKE
		And you'll come through.

	She stares in his eyes.  And dead straight.

				ANNABELLE
		If I miss it, daddy?  You clue

	Okay, he nods.  That's a plan.

	INT. BAR - NIGHT

	The dimly chic bar.  With its soft upscale buzz.  Where Jackie
	told Luke she had cancer.  Tonight, she waits alone.  Watching the
	entrance.  Nursing her drink.  And then...

	...Rachel comes into the place.  Spots Jackie across the room.
	Weaves her way through the tables.

	And she is there.  Slipping into her seat.  Not knowing what to
	say.

				JACKIE
		Thanks for coming out.

				RACHEL
		Neutral ground.  What's up?

	Jackie stares evenly.  Her chin rests across the back of her
	knuckles.  She looks tired, but okay.  Fueled by adrenaline.

				JACKIE
		Luke called.  He says you're
		checking out.  Of the Heartbreak
		Hotel.

	The waitress appears.  Rachel too locked into the moment to notice.
	So...

				JACKIE
		She likes a Stolie, no ice.

          Mike sits on the back porch nursing a beer. Terry stands in
          the yard facing away from him.
                         
                          TERRY
           We were right there, Mike. Right

           nothing. Nothing!
                         
          Terry screams. It's a primal scream. Mike just looks at him.
                         
                          MIKE
           You OK?

          Terry drinks. Mike watches him. Jackie pops out from the

     A view of the house over the meadows.

     The sun setting is behind the mountain peaks, making the

     CALEB and NATHAN are in the dining area.
     It is set for dinner.   Only two chairs.

     NATHAN is at the table, nursing a bottle of Peroni beer.

     CALEB stands by panoramic window, looking at the view.

                           NATHAN
               So?

     CALEB turns.

                         CALEB
               Sorry. I was just ordering my

               Don't order. Just speak.

               She's fascinating. When you talk

     The judge is too stunned to respond. The others in the              
     court can't believe what they've just heard. The Mayor of

     The hospital is in the long attic of Valjean's factory.             

     Valjean hurries into the hospital, breathless. He sees a
     nursing sister outside Fantine's room.

                         VALJEAN
               Is her daughter with her?

                         NURSE
               No, monsieur. Her guardian sent
               this.

     She gives Valjean a note. He reads it with mounting anger.

                         VALJEAN
               `Money not enough. Send more.

     Fantine lies in bed, delirious. She is dressed in pure              
     white. Her eyes are closed.

             The boy has tried to persuade her, but she is
             far too ashamed, I think.  If she was given a
             little time...  You understand? 

                          FRENCH 
             Of course.  Your son... Todd's father...

                          DUSSANDER 
             He is not without blame, believe me.  The
             hours he works.  The meals he has missed.  
             They take a toll on a family.  I was raised
             to believe that a man's family came before 
             his work or anything else.  I tried to teach
             my son that... but --

                          FRENCH 
             There's only so much we can teach our kids, 
             Mr. Bowden.  ...What about Monica's mother or
             father?  Couldn't they talk to her? 

                          DUSSANDER 
             Her mother, Sabrina, lives in a nursing home
             in Florida.  I'm afraid after her husband
             died she lost her will to live.  

                          FRENCH 
             Probably not the best person for Monica to
             speak to.  

                          DUSSANDER
             Indeed.  

                          FRENCH 
             Mr. Bowden, I don't have to remind you, I'm 
             sure, of Todd's stellar academic record.

             Yes.  I keep his certificates on the wall of

          Curtis walks around his truck to get a better look at the
          depot. The dirt lot is piled high with containers.
          He studies the "FOR SALE" sign, then a smaller sign next to
          it that lists available sizes.
          Curtis turns back to his truck and rubs his face, still
          shaking things off. He looks up at the sky. Clear and blue.
          A thought comes to him. He checks his watch.

          Curtis' truck pulls into the parking lot of the Pleasant
          Grove Apartments. It's a well manicured, new construction
          facility. The words "AN ASSISTED LIVING COMMUNITY" are
          written under the apartment name on the sign out front.

          Curtis stands by the door for apartment 212 in an interior

           45.

                         
          A passing ATTENDANT guides an elderly WOMAN down the hallway.
          Curtis nods to them.
          The door opens. SARAH(61), a plainly dressed woman much too
          young to live in a nursing home, looks surprised.

           Come in.

                          CURTIS

          I think the break is just about

Kate puts a TWENTY DOLLAR BILL down.

The bartender pours her another shot.

Kate has clearly been drinking for awhile -- she's curled up

                     What <u>could</u> I tell him?  There's

                     Japs, but I don't like 'em neither.

          Mini dances with a few friends in a very short mini-skirt and

          Diane is beautiful, but there is an essential hardness to her
          that comes from a life spent trading on her looks. The
          blouse and mini-skirt she wears are inappropriately revealing
          for the occasion of her daughter's birthday.

                  you just as soon as I can. Mahalo.

     Looking as though he's about to vomit, Matt hangs up, regards
     the flyer on the coffee table before him.

                               SID (O.S.)
                  Hey, boss.

     Matt looks up to see Sid in his boxers.

                            SID (CONT'D)
                  Did you call him?

                            MATT
                  None of your business. And put some
                  clothes on. And you're not sleeping in
                  Alex's room. In fact, you should
                  really go home, son.

               Jules, on the other hand, just has a cup of coffee and a 
               muffin. He seems far away in thought. The Waitress pours a 
               refill for both men,

                         on swine.
