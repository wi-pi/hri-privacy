          In a sitting area, LELAND "LEE" JANUS, 60's, a vigorous
          pit-bull in tux shirt and bow-tie, turns from the TV --

          Those number crunchers can get a
          little over-zealous, can't they,
          but Christ, when we write the GAAP
          rules like some kind of abstract
          painting. Stare at that liability
          hard enough and before long it'll
          turn into an asset.

          The Division Chief, Franks, other Group Chiefs huddle
          over another, blank, MONITOR.
          ANGLE: ON THE BLANK MONITOR, suddenly, an image pops on --
          desert seen from seven miles up. A wide shot of sand and
          more sand.
          The room lets out soft YEAHS as the image shifts, finding
          a distant highway cutting through it.

      LORD MANSFIELD before the painting, shielding it from us.
      ON ZOFFANY as his eyes fall on the window. LORD MANSFIELD
      follows his gaze, to DIDO alone in the gardens, reading.

      POV: THROUGH THE WINDOW, as DIDO feels their gaze. She
      falters. Her eyes dart through the glass, beyond LORD
      MANSFIELD, to the canvas....The sight causes her to stand -
      drawn to the window to see more clearly.
      The camera, too, draws in on the portrait, now. And as it
      is revealed to DIDO, so too, is it finally revealed to us.

      It is a serenely sensitive representation of two delicate
      English ladies - one part black, as they stand as equals,
      against Kenwood's iconic gardens.

      CLOSE on DIDO, shaken, taking in the extraordinary image.
      Off both men, each as moved as she is.

          Shuts the door behind him. Mark's never been in a room like
          this - oil paintings of du Pont ancestors; foxhounds, horses,
          hunts. Leather-bound books share space with framed OLD STAMPS
          and antique (and not so antique) PISTOLS. Framed PHOTOS of
          the same man (JOHN DU PONT - 50, thin, beak-nosed, blond-grey
          hair) with Presidents Ford, Nixon, Reagan... Henry Kissinger.
                         
          Mark's standing, gazing at the photos, when the door opens,
          revealing JOHN DU PONT, a police-issue HOLSTER dangling from
          one hand. He stops and breathlessly regards Mark.

     hangs a disturbing PAINTING: the portrait of a clown, a young

     hunched. He wears a stuporous ear-to-ear smile that looks
     like one continuous deep scar.

                          JANE CHAMBERS (cont'd)
               The clown in the painting is the book's
               main character, Gwynplain. When he was a
               child he had his mouth slashed ear to ear
               and then sold to the 16th century Spanish
               aristocracy to be used as a court jester.

	In varying KANE makeups he tears through scenes and actors: laughing 
	with AGNES MOOREHEAD on the cabin set; charming RUTH WARRICK on 
the 

	breakfast table set; berating DOROTHY COMMINGORE on the Great Hall 
	set...
	
	He speeds back and forth and back and forth from the set to the camera 
	in the Campaign Headquarters set, never happy with the shot. . .
	
	Gregg Toland watches, bemused, as Welles shifts tiny prop pieces on the 
	set. . .
	
	Welles bullies and screams and pleads and seduces. Like an obsessed 
	artistic tornado he is seemingly everywhere at once. We see him 
	rejecting matte paintings and in makeup and rewriting the script and 
	trying on costumes and selecting props and leaping into odd positions 
	looking for the perfect camera angle.

	          lapels. He takes their voices.
	
	In this country we still have our voices. And we can sing with them. 
	And we can argue with them. And we can be heard. Because we are . . . 
	for the moment . . . free. No one can tell us what to say or how to say 
	it, can they? We have no brown shirt thugs here ruling our lives, do 
	we? No one can take our voices, can they? Because we are free.
	
	I am one voice and that is all. My picture is one voice. Men are dying 
	in Europe now -- and Americans soon will be -- so that we can surmount 
	the tyrants and the dictators. Will you send a message across this 
	country that one man can take away our voices?
	
	So ... who is Mr. Hearst and who is Mr. Welles? Mr. Hearst built a 
	palace of brick and mortar and starting little wars and corpses piled

       Like Bumpy used to do every Thanksgiving, Frank and his
       brothers, from the back of the truck, hand out hundreds of
       freshly-butchered turkeys to the poor.

212    INT. MAMA LUCAS'S TEANECK, N.J. HOUSE - DAY                  212

       Frank, in an apron, carries in a huge cooked turkey as the
       extended Lucas family gathers around the table. It's like
       Norman Rockwell painting -

       Richie alone at his kitchen table with a sandwich and a
       beer. The Macy's parade plays silently on his TV.

       A doorbell summons Trupo. He comes through his entry.
       Opens the front door. Finds no one there - except a large
       live turkey on the doorstep. He stares at it nonplussed,
       then looks up to a sound - a whoosh - as flames engulf the
       interior and spit out the windows of his Shelby Mustang ...

       family engaged in several conversations at once, laughing -

                   I used to sit here with Ana in my old
                   car. She hated it. Now I don't even
                   have a car. Or her.

      Frank glances to where his favorite diner used to be, and
      across the street to where he shot Tango. It isn't a fruit
      stand any more.

                   Who the fuck would buy those?

      A car equipped with sub-woofer bass comes booming past.
      Frank stares at it with the same pained look Bumpy had at
      the discount emporium.

                                RICHIE
                   Your brothers know you're out?
                                FRANK
                   I haven't talked to them in years. It's
                   better that way. For them. I don't know
                   where they are. Went back to Greensboro
                   when they got out, I guess.

          The car speeds along the empty highway, carving through thick
          forests of pine trees.
          Inside the car it's quiet. Patrick's stare is fixed to the
          road -- the rhythm of the white lines that pulse by. Angie
          rests her head against the passenger window, the BLUR of the

          the passing of time.

26 years of experience working against him. He figures anything big enough
to sink the ship they're going to see in time to turn. But the ship's too
big, with too small a rudder... it can't corner worth shit. Everything he
knows is wrong.

ROSE is ignoring this conversation. She has the art-nouveau comb with the
jade butterfly on the handle in her hands, turning it slowly. She is
watching a monitor, which shows the ruins of Suite B-52/56. PUSH IN until
the image fills frame.

103 INT. ROSE'S SUITE

... 1912. Like in a dream the beautiful woodwork and satin upholstery
emerge from the rusted ruin. Jack is overwhelmed by the opulence of the
room. He sets his sketchbood and drawing materials on the marble table.

                                   ROSE

Will this light do? Don't artists need good light?

                                   JACK

                            (bad French accent)

Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions.

                          (seeing the paintings)

Hey... Monet!

He crouches next to the paintings stacked against the wall.

                                   JACK

Isn't he great... the use of color? I saw him once... through a hole in
this garden fence in Giverny.

She goes into the adjoining walk-in wardrobe closet. He sees her go to the
safe and start working the combination. He's fascinated.

                                   ROSE

Cal insist on luggin this thing everywhere.

                                   JACK

Should I be expecting him anytime soon?

                                   ROSE

Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out.

CLUNK! She unlocks the safe. Glancing up, she meets his eyes in the mirror
behind the safe. She opens it and removes the necklace, then holds it out
to Jack who takes it nervously.

The room is empty except for Andrews. An ashtray falls off the table.
Behind him Jack and Rose run into the room, out of breath and soaked. They
run through, toward the aft revolving door... then Rose recognizes him. She
sees that his lifebelt is off, lying on a table.

                                   ROSE

Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?

Andrews picks up his lifebelt and hands it to her.

Good luck to you, Rose.

                         ADULT PI (V.O.)
               I met Christ in the mountains when
               I was 12. We were visiting
               relatives, tea growers in Munnar.
               It was our third day there; Ravi
               and I were terribly bored.

     Ravi walks up to Pi, coins in hand, and whispers.

                         RAVI (14)
               Challenge. I'll give you two

               You must be thirsty. Here, I
               brought you this.

     Not knowing what else to do, Pi takes the glass and drinks.
     An awkward pause as he searches for something - anything - to
     say. He finally points up to one of the paintings.

                         PI
               Why would a god do that? Why would
               he send his own son to suffer for
               the sins of ordinary people?

     The Priest smiles down upon Pi.

                         PRIEST
               Because He loves us. God made
               Himself approachable to us - human -
               so we could understand Him.

EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY

A BURNING FLARED-OUT SUN.  The camera pans down to DUKE
DRIVING THE WRECKED WHALE.  A piece of the fence flies out
of the back seat as he takes a bump.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            There was only one road back to L.A.
            US Interstate 15, just a flat-out
            high speed burn through Baker and
            Barstow and Berdoo, then on to the
            Hollywood Freeway straight into
            frantic oblivion: safety, obscurity,
            just another freak in the Freak
            Kingdom.

DUKE sees THE HARDWARE BARN, A RUSTIC OLD FARM BUILDING
facing the road with a single gas pump outside and a neon
sign that flashes beer.

                         DUKE
            Ahhh.  Wonderful.

DUKE PULLS OFF THE ROAD and parks.  Gets out and walks in.

INT. HARDWARE BARN - BAKER, CALIFORNIA - DAY

DUKE enters the DARK, CLUTTERED INTERIOR.  Scattered all
about the store are BITS OF AMERICANA... OLD BARRELS, WAGON
WHEELS, WOODEN YOKES.  A STUFFED HORSE HANGS FROM THE
RAFTERS.  The sunlight shafts through high windows.  AN OLD
MAN is repairing an iron pot-bellied stove near the wooden
bar.  A NORMAN ROCKWELL PAINTING... ONLY REAL.

                         PROPRIETOR
            What'll you have?

DUKE can't quite believe this place -- too good to be true.

                   (doubtfully)
            Ballantine Ale...?

THE PROPRIETOR serves the ale up ice cold.  DUKE SMILES AND
RELAXES.

                         DUKE
            Hard to find it served like this
            anymore.

As he drinks, DUKE toys with a rack of key chains -- LITTLE

          The broad thoroughfare now all that remains of whatever town
          once stood here. Many of the old storefronts still largely
          intact but patched up with salvaged materials. The asphalt
          street warped and cracked, parking meters bent and smashed.
          
          It's a lot like the abandoned town Eli passed through
          earlier, except VERY MUCH ALIVE - BUSTLING WITH TOWNSFOLK.
          
          It's at once a familiar and also a disturbing sight - like an
          old Norman Rockwell painting of classic small-town America,
          but filtered through the devastating eye of an apocalypse. An
          unsettling juxtaposition of the old world and the new.

          The centerpiece of the town is a GRAND THEATER at the head of
          the main street. THE PALLADIUM. Like the rest of the town,
          badly damaged and shoddily fixed-up. But still standing.

     Somerset looks at the photos in his hand, hesitant.  These
     photos show Mr. Gold's corpse, not covered in any way.

                   This has got to be it.

     Somerset puts the painting down, resting it on its bottom edge.
     The frame is backed by a thick sheet of brown paper.  He points
     to where the wire used to be screwed into the frame, and to
     where it has been re-screwed.

                   It has to be.  He changed the wire to
                   rehang it.

     Somerset tears along the edge of the brown paper to get to the
     space between it and the canvas.  He tears out the entire sheet.
     Mills helps pull it away, but there's nothing there.  Empty.
     Mills looks at both sides of the paper, then tosses it away.

                                 MILLS
                   It's nothing.

     Somerset pays the painting down, face up.  He pokes his finger
     on the painted surface.  Mills watches as Somerset kneels, takes
     out a credit card and presses it's edge against the canvas,
     trying to peel up some of the paint.

          Rebecca shows Sara into a room full of paintings. In the

          exhibition.

          They stop in front of Richard Prince's "Nurse of
          Greenmeadow." It's a portrait of a woman in a nurse's mask.
          Her eyes peer directly at the viewer. Blood is smeared on her
          smock.

                         REBECCA
          This is my favorite.
          Sara steps closer to examine it. Rebecca stays behind her.

          I love how he captures her
          personality through her eyes. It's
          like she really wants to help you.
          Rebecca's hands tug anxiously at her shirt. She really wants
          Sara to like this painting.
          Sara moves even closer. She squints, trying to see what
          Rebecca sees. The woman's expression in the painting is
          actually pretty sinister.
          Sara's a little freaked out... but she turns to see Rebecca's
          hopeful expression. Sara brightens.

pleased to hear his good humor. He puts an arm around her.

          You're wonderful, Ma! It's the old
          boy, all right. That's father!

              (laughing gaily)
          You're a naughty boy, Bruno. But
          you can always make me laugh.
              (she rises)
          Now get shaved, dear, before your
          father gets home.

Bruno's fist crashes down on the little table, upsetting it,
as he gets to his feet.

                      BRUNO
          I'm sick and tired of bowing and
          scraping to the king.

                         MRS. ANTHONY
                 (placating him)
          Now,    now, Let's not lose control.
          Come    see my painting, dear --
                 (she leads him toward
                  an easel)
          I do    wish you'd take up painting.
          It's    such a soothing pastime.

They look at the painting.

The painting is a horrible mess. Out of the violence of the
pattern a man's face can be discerned, wild-eyed and
distorted. We hear laughter from Bruno.

              (bewildered)
          It is? I was trying to paint Saint
          Francis.

At this moment there is the sound of the front door opening.
Then immediately the telephone bell rings in the hall. Bruno
is instantly alert, as if he had been expecting a call. He
goes toward the door to the hall, as the butler enters.

                      BUTLER
              (to Bruno)
          They are ready with your call to
          Southampton, Sir.

Bruno's father MR. ANTHONY, purposefully enters the living
room. He an impeccably dressed business man with an
uncompromising eye. His entrance momentarily blocks Bruno's
exit.

          Well, there you are.

                      MRS. ANTONY (CONT'D)
              (she sighs and rises,
               winding it up)
          Well, Miss Burton, it was very nice
          of you to call. You must excuse me
          now. I must get back to my painting.
          Do you care for painting, Miss Burton?
          I find it so soothing.
              (shakes Anne's hand)
          You must come again sometime.

She goes out. Anne is left helpless, standing in the middle
of the room. She picks up her purse and is about to go when
she hears a voice:
                      BRUNO'S VOICE
          Oh, Miss Burton!

Anne turns back in direction of the voice. CAMERA   PULLS
BACK until we can see the feet of Bruno protruding  from behind
a chair in which he is sitting. He has obviously   heard the
entire conversation between Anne and his mother.   Bruno rises.
He is in dressing gown and pajamas.

                       BRUNO
          I'm afraid mother wasn't very helpful,
          was she?
              (he strolls toward
               Anne)
          You know she hasn't been well for a
          long time. She's a little -- how
          shall I say -- confused.
              (shakes his head
               commiseratingly)
          Poor mother.

Anne is too stunned to speak.

                      BRUNO
          You know, I'm very upset with Guy.
          He shouldn't have sent you on an
          errand like this.

                      ANNE
          Guy doesn't know I'm here, Mr. Antony.

INT. LOFT - DAY

An abstract painting on a wall fills the screen.  Light
laughter is heard, as well as the sophisticated music;
offscreen brunch guests chatter indistinctly.

            These things are delicious!  What
            in the world are they?

Holly walks onto the screen in front of the painting.  She
holds an almost empty tray of hors d'oeuvres; she wears a
uniform.

            Oh, um, those are quail eggs.

            Oh, they're very good.

Holly walks past the painting towards the female brunch
guest.  A man walks in front of her.  Chatter, light
laughter, and music are still heard; a party is in progress.

several clusters of brunch guests.  They are eating and
drinking.  No one pays any attention to her.

	EXT. DOLL-SHOP - NIGHT

	We see Madeleine, inside, painting a doll's face. Louis
	and Claudia arrive outside.

				CLAUDIA
		All her dolls resemble me.


	POV

	Claudia's face, with the dolls in the background. The
	resemblance is uncanny.

				CLAUDIA
		Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never
		change either.

				LOUIS
		You are neither, Claudia. Now stop
		this -

	Madeleine sees Claudia from inside. She waves.

		Yes, and very beautiful.

				LOUIS
		Your lips, they didn't move.

				ARMAND
		They did, but too fast for you to
		see them. No magic, just grace and
		speed.

	The boy is watching Louis. Armand's hand beckons and
	the boy draws up to Louis in the candlelight. He places
	his arms on Louis' shoulders. Louis glances at Armand,
	who smiles. Louis sees the puncture marks on the boy's
	neck.

				ARMAND
		He wants you...

	Louis is utterly confused. Can't resist. Drinks his
	blood.

	The boy's body presses against him, sensual, willing.
	The other vampires appear all around Louis, who
	suddenly senses it and draws away, ashamed.

	Claudia watches warily, from a distance. Armand beckons
	at her and Louis and open a door in the wall which
	reveals a stone staircase.


	INT. MEDIEVAL ROOM

	Medieval chairs, table, an old coffin, a bed in one
	corner, a blazing fire. A medieval painting of Satan,
	being banished from heaven, above the fire. Armand
	places the boy on the bed, settling him so he sleeps.

				ARMAND
		Disappointing, isn't it? To come so
		far and find so little. Jaded
		ingenues, amusing themselves with
		make- believe...

				LOUIS
		We had feared we were the only
		ones...

				ARMAND
		But how did you come into
		existence?

	He glances at Louis, then at Claudia, who averts her
	eyes.

				ARMAND
		You don't want to answer... Two
		vampires from the new world, come
		to guide us into the new era as all
		we love slowly rots and fades away.

	She touches his face.

				CLAUDIA
		Is that what I should do Louis? Let
		you go? My father? My lover? My
		Louis, who made me?

	There are tears in her eyes. Louis lifts her up in his
	arms.

				LOUIS
		He can protect us, Claudia.

				CLAUDIA
		You really believe that?


	EXT. DOLL-SHIP - NIGHT

	Claudia, staring at the dolls. We see Madeleine inside,
	painting a doll. She sees Claudia and smiles and waves.


	INT. THEATRE - NIGHT

	Louis, sitting alone in the box, as the curtains draw
	back, to show Santiago as death, as before. Louis takes
	advantage of the darkness to slip away.


	INT. ARMAND'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Armand opens the door to Louis' knock.

				ARMAND
		I was waiting for you...

				LOUIS

          INT KITTREDGE'S APARTMENT LIVING ROOM DAWN
          JOHN FLANDERS KITTREDGE and LOUISA KITTREDGE ("FLAN" and
          "OUISA") , an attractive couple in their 40s, in their night
          clothes are in an uncharacteristic state of shock.
          Some sort of horrible disaster has happened to them.
          THEY survey their living room which under normal
          circumstances would appear to be a serene haven.
          But why are they-so aghast? And terrified?
          Has the apartment been violated?
          The Fifth Avenue apartment, red and cozy, threadbare with
          the legacy of years of kids and dogs running in and out, is
          filled with beautiful objects chosen with care. Even though
          the apartment is 19th Century in feel, a lot of modern
          paintings hang on the walls.
          No. No visible disaster here.
          But then why FLAN and OUISA's emotional state? THEY run
          between the hall and the living room.

                         OUISA
          Is anything gone?
          OUISA opens the front closet with trepidation. But nothing
          leaps out. SHE sees a mink is still there..

                         FLAW
          How can I look? I'm shaking.

                         OUISA
          My god! The Kandinsky!
          0UISA runs into the living room. SHE can see by the
          discoloration on that wall that a painting is missing.

                         OUISA Y
          It's gone! Call the police!

          There it is!
          An early abstract painting by Kandinsky leans against a
          Philadelphia Chippendale chair: the painting is wild and
          brilliantly colored.

                         0UISA
          Thank god!
          SHE picks the painting up and flips it around. It's a double
          sided painting. The artist, Kandinsky, had painted in
          different styles on either side of the canvas.

          One side of the painting is geometric and somber; the other
          side is all chaos and brilliant colors.
          OUISA replaces the framed canvas on the wall where it
          belongs, but the side she chooses to display is the
          geometric side. SHE admires it.
          FLAN opens the door from the hall into

          THE OFFICE.
          A computer. Calendars. File cabinets. Bulletin boards with
          prints of paintings tacked on. FLAN checks - the slide
          projector is there. FLAN opens and closes cabinet drawers.
          OUISA appears in the doorway of the office.

                         OUISA
          We could've been killed.

          Here's dinner. All ready.

                         OUISA

          This room has not been in use for a while.
          The overhead chandelier is very bright and harsh.
          A sewing machine is in the corner there.
          Bookkeeping items at one end of the long table.
          Nineteenth century Victorian mythological paintings hang.on
          the walls. FLAN adjusts the rheostat to dim the lights in
          the chandelier.

          mats and silverware and quickly sets the table.

    The saddest eyes you ever saw.

    We are looking at an El Greco drawing.       It is a study for
    one of his paintings.

    PULL BACK TO REVEAL --

    A bunch of art students are doing sketches of the eyes,
    the elongated fingers, the slender hands El Greco drew so
    brilliantly.

    Most of the students are around 20.        A couple of suburban
    housewives are there too.

    And one older man.

    This is LUTHER WHITNEY. Mid 60s, very fit, neatly
    dressed. At quick glance, he seems as if he might be a
    successful company executive.

    As we watch him draw we can tell he is capable of great
    concentration. And patient. With eyes that miss
    nothing: He has pilot's eyes.

    We'll find out more about him as time goes on, but this
    is all you really have to know: Luther Whitney is the
    hero of this piece. As we watch him draw --

    Luther's sketchbook. He is finishing his work on the
    eyes, and he's caught the sadness: It's good stuff.

    Luther. It's not good enough for him.        He looks at his
    work a moment, shakes his head.

                                GIRL STUDENT
               Don't give up.

                                LUTHER
               I never do.

                                GIRL STUDENT
               May I?

    She's indicated his sketchbook.      He nods.   She starts
    thumbing through.

    The sketchbook as the pages turn.

    Detail work. Eyes and hands. The eyes are good.         The
    hands are better. Very skillful.

     John stares out the window at the city beyond.    Life seems
     so close.

     He looks back into the large communal visiting room; a dozen
     round tables and plastic chairs. The concrete block walls
     are covered with naive paintings in bright colors and messages
     of hope. Luke plays at his feet with a basket of Legos.

     The door at the far side buzzes, a guard opens it and
     prisoners in red jump-suits marked VISITING ROOM enter.

     Lara enters and looks around. She is pale, thin and her
     hair has returned to its natural color. Lara hurries to him
     and gives him a real kiss. She breaks and steps to Luke,
     who plays with his back to her.

                            LARA
                Hi honey. Can Mommy get a kiss?

               Oh, yes. He'd say there's no
               point to them. They're just for
               fun. Apart from school concerts,
               of course, which are no fun at
               all, so we go to those. The
               proper ones don't help you get

               Yes. I will. I know. Sometimes it
               seems as though that's what all
               this slog is for. If I get to
               University, I'm going to read
               what I want and think about what
               I want and listen to what I want.
               And I'm going to look at
               paintings and go to French films
               and talk to people who know lots
               about lots.

                         DAVID
               Good for you. Which University?

                         JENNY
               Oxford. If I'm lucky. Did you go
               anywhere?

                         DAVID
               I studied at what I believe they
               call the University of Life. And
               I didn't get a very good degree
               there.

     Jenny smiles.

                         JENNY
               This is me. Thank you.

     She gets out of the car with the cello. David stares after
     her for a moment, then drives off.

29   INT. DANNY'S FLAT. DAY                                      29

     A beautiful, large, airy sitting room in the first-floor
     flat in Bedford Square. The flat is unusually and
     tastefully decorated, opulent and indicative of Bohemian
     good taste. Jenny is sipping a glass of white wine and
     walking around the room enthralled, looking at Danny's
     existing Pre-Raphaelite art collection; he has three or
     four big paintings proudly displayed on his walls. Danny
     is talking her through them while Helen and David, sitting
     on the sofa, watch - David proudly, Helen impassively.

                         DANNY
               A couple of years ago you could
               pick these up for fifty quid, you
               know. Nobody was interested.

                         JENNY
               Really? Fifty pounds? I don't
               believe you.

     Suddenly Jenny sees a cello in the corner of the room - a
     good one.

                         JENNY
               That's not a Lockey-Hill!

                         DANNY
               There aren't many people who come
               in here and say that.

     While David and Helen watch, Danny and Jenny dance. Danny's
     a good dancer; Jenny is nervous at first, but becomes more
     comfortable and more expressive, with Danny's help.

                         JENNY
                   (knowing that she should

               I'm still trying to work out what
               makes good things good. It's
               hard, isn't it?

                         DANNY
               The thing is, Jenny, you know,
               without necessarily being able to
               explain why. You've got taste.
               That's not even half the
               battle. That's the whole war.

     Jenny smiles at him with gratitude. There is a sudden
     closeness between them. David is watching them carefully.
     They return to their table.

                         DAVID
               Jenny, we should go. It's late.

               In spite of herself, Tabby laughs at this. This gives Kelly

               When he leaves ABE opens his eyes and listens to the door 
               CLOSE downstairs.

                         Oh, that's all right. Actually, I'm 
                         here to see Tabby. Just to do a little 
                         painting with her.

               her hand.

                         You did.

               She goes back to painting. Kelly stands there for a minute, 
               waiting for her to say something else, give him an invitation.

               She doesn't. Until she looks up and sees him standing in the 
               same place.

                         Well you're here now. Go ahead. Set 
                         your canvas up. Use one of the ones 
                         in the corner.

               Kelly looks through them and picks one.

               Kelly busies himself pulling out paints and other supplies.

               He can't help but look at her. The light hits her hair and 
               she glows. She catches him looking.

                         So, what do we have here, a little

                         That would be stock boy at the Shop

                         If you stop, you might not be able 
                         to start again. Or you might start

                                     XIOU-XIOU
                         Each line has a whole drawing 
                         contained in it. Each drawing has a 
                         whole life contained in it.

                                     KELLY
                         Oh, that's all?

               Kelly watches her for a minute, the delicate whoop and swirl 
               of her strokes.

               He dips a brush into the ink and watches Xiou-Xiou's 
               restrained and confident movements.

               Eve leans against the doorframe.

                                     EVE
                         Hey you two. I'll try not to act 
                         surprised. It might spoil the moment.

               Kelly puts down the paintbrush.

                         I want a drink. Let me borrow a couple 
                         bucks.

                                     BART
                         I told you not to play him for money.

                         I was trying to be nice. He's your 
                         friend.

               Bart returns the pump and screws in the gas cap.

                                     BART
                         Exactly. You should know better. 
                         What do you want.

                         Mountain Dew -

               Just then he glances towards the gas station and sees EVE, 
               set up in the adjacent abandoned lot. She's got the van parked 
               there with the sliding door open and paintings propped around 
               on display.

                                     KELLY
                         -- Oh shit.

               But Eve has seen him. She shields her eyes with her hand and 
               calls to him.

                                     EVE
                         Kelly!

               Kelly backtracks towards the car.

                                     BART
                         That woman's calling you.

               Eve walks over to them. Kelly can't get out of it.

                                     KELLY
                              (low)
                         Bart. Meet my mom.

               Eve smiles brightly.

                         I never ask you anything but you

               She examines it and takes out a wet sponge. She wipes it 
               across the back of the canvas.

               She works silently for a minute. Kelly watches her. She cuts 
               a small piece of canvas to repair the hole.

               A small narrow room. Handsome wall paintings -- a Tuscan hill
               town. Very slow day.
          
               Nicky and Elliot sitting with a carafe of wine, a bottle of
               mineral water and some bread sticks. Glancing at menus
               intermittently.

                         I'm trying to think. When did you
                         start looking so terrible? You look
                         awful.

EXT. KATTEGAT SEA, JUTLAND, DENMARK, 1920'S, DAY

FADE IN:

A rectangle of ferociously stormy sea viewed from battered
cliffs. Silver waves are whipped by a wind that flies at us,
stinging, relentless. Somewhere, unseen in the barren
landscape, something is at its mercy - we hear the RUSTLE and
PUNCH of the weather going at it...

INT. WOMAN'S EYE

The same scene reflected across the surface of a woman's
brown eye, intense with emotion, curiosity. Gradually, the
WEATHER SOUNDS are overtaken by VOICES coming up. At first
the SOCIAL CHATTER is PERIPHERAL, then the VOICES grow more
STRIDENT, OPPRESSIVE. The eye blinks.


INT. GALLERY, COPENHAGEN, DENMARK, EVENING

A painting of the same sea, captured with remarkable accuracy
of feeling. A HUBBUB OF GABBLING VOICES. Too many people in
a low-ceilinged room. One voice dominates now -

                     OLDER WOMAN (O.S.)

where her handsome husband EINAR WEGENER is being showered
with praise. A portly goateed man dominates the scene -
RASMUSSEN, Einar's dealer.

Einar manages to laugh now as the dog runs BARKING in

There are lights on in the Widow House.


INT. WIDOW HOUSE, STUDIO, NIGHT

Gerda closes the book she's been reading, looks up to see
Einar, working, engrossed. An almost trance-like state. She
watches him a while, then approaches, rests her head against
his back. He's comfortable with this, but works on.

                       GERDA
             Such concentration. Sometimes when you're
             working, I think you're going to slip
             through the surface of the painting and
             vanish.

He smiles a little.

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             Sink into the bog. Like your friend's kite
             when you were a boy.

                        EINAR
             Hans.   It was Hans' kite I crashed.

Einar enjoys the memory for a moment.

                       EINAR (cont'd)
             Poor Hans. He was so proud of it...
             I couldn't believe he even let me
             have a turn...

                       GERDA
             He's probably still sitting on a
             rock, sobbing his heart out.

Einar sets down his brush, turns toward her, away from his
work, smiles.

                       EINAR
             He's a dealer in Paris, peddling
             Old Masters to rich Americans.

                       GERDA
             Oh. So we don't need to worry
             about Hans.

Einar rides it out.    Gerda doesn't miss a beat.

                       GERDA
             No, she stayed behind in Denmark.

                       ENTHUSIASTIC AMERICAN WOMAN
             Oh, I was so hoping to meet her.

Einar looks down, away, affected... Gerda's swept off by the
gallery owner, leaving Einar in the company of the paintings
of his own banished self.


INT. PARIS APARTMENT, BEDROOM, NIGHT

Gerda and Einar in bed, close, tenderness on both sides.
Gerda gently kisses Einar, then begins to work her way down
his torso. He closes his eyes, wills himself to let this
happen... Gerda begins to fellate him... He struggles with
his breathing, intensely challenged

                       EINAR
             Gerda... please... I can't.

She continues... He's overwhelmed with panic, pushes her off.

                       EINAR (cont'd)
             No...

The attempt at intimacy is over, failed. Einar's full of
guilt, distress. Gerda's hurt, lost. Neither moves -
emotional paralysis.


INT. PARIS APARTMENT, STUDIO,    - NEXT DAY

Gerda works on a self-portrait. Einar appears. Gerda
hurries, to greet him, summons a playful mood, born of
desperation.

                       GERDA
             Will you sit for me? Just as you
             are. We haven't done that since
             art school. You enjoyed it then...

He smiles.    She strokes his face, encouraged.

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             The teacher suddenly at the mercy of the
             student. You found it exciting.

Gerda curls in to him.    He gently extricates himself.

Gerda feels ashamed, can't help herself:

                       GERDA
             I miss you. I miss you working beside me.

Einar hesitates, then admits:

                       EINAR
             I can't remember the landscape any more.      I
             can't remember Vejle.

Gerda struggles to adjust to this, then:

                       GERDA
             Well you could help me with this
             background. What does it need...?

Einar looks at the painting, can hardly pull it into focus...

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             An kettlehole lake? A farmhouse, far off?                  *

He gently stops her -

             Gerda...

He's not going to do it.        Turns away, goes out.

Gerda watches from the window: Einar in the street below, on
through the crowds until he's out of sight.


EXT. RUE DE NUIT, DAY

Different part of town, different atmosphere. Prostitutes on
the corner CLUCK indulgent as Einar passes. He looks self-
consciously about, enters a dingy house as another man comes
out. They barely acknowledge one another.

          I've a new dealer coming over later.    I'd
          like you to meet him.

                    EINAR
          I don't want a new dealer. It doesn't make
          sense for me. I'm hardly working anyway.

                    GERDA
          That might change.

                    EINAR
          I don't think so.    I'm happy helping you.

She goes to contradict, but he cuts her off:

                       EINAR (cont'd)
          No dealer.     Thank you.

                    GERDA

          Dinner at La Dauphine at eight, then back
          here to see the paintings.

Gerda's out of the door, leaving Einar alone with the news.


INT. LA DAUPHINE RESTAURANT, NIGHT

An intimate place by the Pont Neuf. An empty chair at the
table. Gerda and Hans wait. Hans smokes.

          It was handmade, and I've had it

          reminded me. I'll tease him about

She goes ahead of Hans, sees: Lili on the chaise, in
imitation of a pose in a painting on the wall behind her...
dangerously charged, her cheek flushed, eyes shining. A tray
with crystal glasses.

                          GERDA (cont'd)
             Lili...

Gerda reorientates herself in the proceedings, turns to Hans
who stands struggling to make sense of the scene before him:

                       GERDA (CONT'D) (cont'd)
             Hans, may I introduce Lili Wegener -
             Einar's cousin from home.

Now Lili's up, her hand held out.          Hans takes it...

                       LILI
             You can't imagine how happy I am.

He holds on to her hand, instinctively kind...

                       LILI (cont'd)
             We met before in Vejle, but you probably
             don't remember...

Hans is utterly wrongfooted...

                       GERDA
             Can I take your coat Hans?

                       HANS
             Of course...

He comes to, allows Gerda to relieve him of it. She takes it
away. Lili continues, frighteningly animated...

                       LILI
             A digestif, Hans? It's so chilly all of a
             sudden. I feel the cold these days. I
             don't know why...

                       LILI
             I know, but now I'm back, I can sit
             for you again, can't I...?   That
             worked well before, Gerda, didn't
             it...?

Lili and Gerda take each other in, on a new footing...


INT. PARIS APARTMENT, STUDIO, DAY - MONTAGE

Gerda paints Lili who has found a new stillness. A more
serious spirit beneath the translucent skin. A sense of her
growing into herself.

We see on the wall now a number of double portraits, telling
the story of a developing negotiation - Gerda and Lili
depicted together, with a sense of close friendship or a
wistful attempt at coupledom.

Now Gerda paints with Lili advising... The two
collaborating, a sense of shared vision.

And throughout, we see Lili fully imagined as a woman, and an
increasingly idealised one - unrealistically lovely...


INT. ETIENNE DUFOUR GALLERY, RAINY NIGHT, ONE MONTH LATER

Another show of `Lili' paintings. A lot of the paintings of
the two as a couple, but Gerda is here alone. She feels it.
She works the room, determined, then sees Hans, across the
crowd. Misses a beat. They make their way toward one
another. An awkward social kiss. Gerda's unusually brittle.

                       HANS
             It's a good crowd.

                       GERDA
             She's a popular girl.   Thank you for
             coming.

                       HANS
             Thank you for asking me.   I thought you'd
             forgotten all about me.

                       GERDA

He reaches for her hand.          Gerda stiffens.

                       HANS
             For God's sake.       Take some kindness where
             you can.

He keeps hold of her hand. Gerda feels the warmth of him.
Her eyes fill.

                       GERDA
             Einar always comes back in the end.      He
             always has...

                       HANS
             Maybe this time... he just can't.

                          GERDA
             I'm sorry.

Gerda shakes her head, gently rejecting Hans.

                       GERDA (cont'd)
             I've never not finished a painting, I don't
             know how to give up.

Hans smiles, rueful.       Finally lets Gerda take back her hand.

INT. PARIS APARTMENT, BEDROOM, NIGHT

Gerda appears in the doorway. Sees Einar sitting in the
chair by the bed. She's struck by how vulnerable he looks.
He looks up, and with genuine regret:

                    EINAR/LILI
          I don't think I can give you what you
          want...

He looks away, ashamed. It's unbearable. Gerda approaches
him. He looks like Lili dressed as Einar.

                    EINAR/LILI (cont'd)
          I don't know how long we can go on like
          this.

           I'm sorry, I know we agreed no more... but
           look at me.

She does - carefully, seeing Lili, just below the surface.

                     GERDA
           You're not insane.

Einar's grateful.     Gerda fights emotion...

                     GERDA (cont'd)
           Did I do this to you?

Einar doesn't understand...

           What...?

                     GERDA
           Sometimes I think if it hadn't been for the
           paintings...

                      EINAR
           Oh no... no, no. You helped bring Lili to
           life, but she was always... she was
           waiting...

                     GERDA
           But now she's making you ill.

           I don't know what to do.     The doctors can't
           help me.

Einar's at the end of the road.     Gerda broaches the subject
she most fears:

           Do you want to try one more...?

looks up from reading. Lili takes a pill, resumes writing.

          Then -- inspired, she begins sketching his EYES. Large and
          exaggerated. Then she fills in the shape of his head. His
          ears. His jaw.
          In a rush, his likeness appears. The parents come over to

           And that one started as me, but then
           Mother turned it into a Chinese boy.
          Huh? Walter peers at Jane... then at Margaret. And then --
          it hits him. He grimaces, embarrassed.

                          WALTER
           Oh, you're Mommy! My apologies,
           Honey. I misconstrued the situation.

                          (SHEEPISH)
           Well I'll just mosey along, before Mr.
           Ulbrich comes back and socks me in the
           eye.

                         ON MARGARET
          A gut decision. She stares at Walter, then smiles slyly.

          INT. BISTRO - NIGHT

          An enchanting bistro. Wine barrels, laughing, twinkly tivoli
          lights. Perfection. Walter flamboyantly enters, escorting
          Margaret. Instantly, the STAFF ERUPTS in excitement:
          "Monsieur Keane! Ah, Monsieur Keane is here! Bonsoir!"

                          WALTER
           Bonsoir, gang! Henri! Sorry I didn't
           call first. Est-ce que tout va bien?

                          MAITRE'D
           Je vais bien, merci! Comment allez-
           vous?

                          WALTER
           Je vais bien! I'm with a beautiful
           woman! Could life be any grander??
          They get led in. Margaret is dazzled. Walter whispers.

                          WALTER
           And I don't even have to pay! I'm set
           because I gave the chef a painting.
           You know what he said? "Nobody paints
           Montmartre like Walter Keane!"

                         LATER
          Margaret and Walter enjoy an intimate dinner. The wine flows.

                          MARGARET
           I can't believe you lived in Paris.

                          WALTER
           Best time of my life...

                          MARGARET
           I've never even been on an airplane.

                          (JOCUND)
           I wanted to be an artist, so I just
           went! Studied painting at the Beaux-
           Arts. Lived in a Left Bank studio. I
           survived on bread and wine...

           Damn right!
          A wistful shrug. He chugs his glass.

                          WALTER
           Of course, walkin' away from the
           bourgeois scene wasn't a snap. I had
           to quit my job. Leave my wife. These

          She stares at her wine.

           I've never acted freely. I was the

                          (SHE SIGHS)
           All my paintings are of Jane, because
           she's all I know.

                          WALTER
           You shouldn't knock your work. I'd
           give an eyetooth to have your talent.
          Margaret is taken aback. He's absolutely sincere.

                          WALTER
           You can look into someone and capture
           them on canvas! You paint people!
           (he gestures sadly)
           I can only paint -- things. My street
           scenes are charming... but at the end
           of the day, it's just a collection of
           sidewalks and buildings.
          Walter goes silent. He has revealed his fears.

          ANGLE - MARGARET
          She doesn't know what to say. Gently, she takes his hand.

                          MARGARET
           Walter, I'd bet you could paint
           anything.

                          MARGARET
           I'm not naive.
           (beat; she laughs)
           Well, I am naive. But I know the man
           I'm marrying. Walter can act rash...
           but he's a good provider. And he's
           wonderful with Jane.

                          (CLEAR-EYED)
           Look -- we're both looking for a fresh
           start. I'm a divorcee with a child.
           Walter is a blessing.
          Dee-Ann bites her tongue. The WAITER brings over the check.
          Sitting on it are TWO FORTUNE COOKIES.
          Hm. Margaret stares, utterly serious. She reaches for one...
          then impulsively grabs the other. She cracks the cookie. Dee-
          Ann waits, curious. Margaret reads... then slowly smiles.

                          MARGARET
           "You are on the threshold of untold
           success."

          INT. ART GALLERY - DAY

          A Modish, happening gallery. The white walls are hung with
          ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM: Slashing angles of color, painted over
          rags and glued bolts. On the floor is SCULPTURE made from
          wood and wire.
          In charge is RUBEN, a fussy man in a goatee. He's schmoozing
          a FANCY LADY. They look at a spattered, distorted painting.

                          RUBEN
           What's brilliant about the composition
           is its spontaneity. The image has no
           visual center of attention.

                          FANCY LADY
           It's quite gestural.

                          RUBEN
           Oh definitely! Strongly influenced by
           the tachistes.

                          FANCY LADY
           I heard Tab Hunter was in here,
           looking at one.

           Well... I'm not allowed to say...
          He NODS HIS HEAD up-and-down: Yes, you're right.

                         OUTSIDE
          A car backfires. Ruben turns -- and winces.

           18.

                         
          Through the windows is Walter, climbing out of his massive
          white Cadillac. He's all done up, in beret and scarf. He
          opens the giant trunk and removes a pile of paintings.
          Ruben cringes knowingly. He whispers:

                          RUBEN
           Oh Christ, don't come in here. Please
           don't come in here...
          The door SLAMS. Walter loudly barges in.

                          WALTER
           Ruben, good day! Do you got a minute?

                          RUBEN
           Walter. In polite society, the word
           is "appointment."

                          FANCY LADY
           (glancing back and forth)
           Uh, I could come back later...
          She anxiously hurries for the door. Ruben fumes.
          Walter ignores it all and starts laying out his wares. First,
          the Parisian street scenes, one after another...

           Haven't I seen that one before?

                          WALTER
           Nah! That was painted in the Fifth
           Arrondissement. This is the Sixth
           Arrondissement!

                          RUBEN

                          (SKEPTICAL)
           I don't understand. You lived in
           Paris for a week. How can you still
           be cranking out paintings?
          Walter laughs. He points to his head.

                          WALTER
           It's all up here.
           (beat; a sentimental

                          FLOURISH)
           And here.
          He points to his heart. Ruben frowns and points to the wall.

           19.

                         

                          RUBEN
           Well, it's not going up here.

           Yes it IS!

                          (CUTTING)
           People want Kandinsky, or Rothko!
           They don't want goopy street scenes.

          CLOSEUP - WALTER
          Ouch! This stings terribly.
          Walter glares at the man, then softly slides aside his works.
          Quietly, he pulls out Margaret's Big Eye paintings.

                          WALTER
           Would they want... this?

                          RUBEN

                          (HE SHUDDERS)
           Good God! You've entered a new
           period.

                          WALTER
           No... they're my wife's.
          Fascinated, Ruben glances through Margaret's oils. Canvas
          after canvas of sad kiddies against gray, bleak backgrounds.

          A DINGY CORRIDOR
          The Keane paintings hang here. The only human in sight is
          Walter, forlorn at a card table. Brochures are stacked, and
          he wears a sailor coat with a dandyish ascot.
          The image is grim. Walter listens to the raucous mob. Until,
          THUMP! -- a sloshed MAN stumbles in. Walter brightens and
          stands.

           23.

                         

                          WALTER
           Ah, beautiful! An art lover! Yes

                          MAN

                          (UNCLEAR)
           I'm, uh, just looking for the john.
          A terrible pause. Walter swallows his outrage... then points.
          The guy smiles and tosses Walter a BUCK, as a tip. Walter is
          stunned. The guy toddles away.
          Beat. The Ladies Room opens, and TWO GOSSIPY WOMEN rush out,
          oblivious to Walter. He glowers. ANOTHER MAN bounds in,
          right up to one of Walter's paintings! He stops at it.
          Walter gathers a moment of hope. Does he like it?
          Then the man leans down and opens a CLOSET. He removes a tray
          of bar glasses, kicks the door shut, and scoots away.

          ANGLE - WALTER
          He grimaces... beaten. Walter drops his head on the table.
          Not noticing a DRUNK COUPLE stagger in. They pass a Waif,
          then halt -- taken. They lean in. Enthralled... concerned...

                          TIPSY LADY
           Look at that child. She's so sad.

           Is she poor..?

           Are you "Keane"?

          Across the packed room, he spots Banducci with a black eye.
          Walter halts, uncertain. A bristling tension...
          Until -- Banducci suddenly rushes and GRABS him! Walter
          flails, freaked. Banducci DRAGS him into a back kitchen --

          He grins manically and pulls Walter into a hearty HUG.

          Walter freezes up. Until -- Dick grins conspiratorially.

                          DICK
           Hey pal, don't lose any sleep. I eat
           this stuff with a spoon! It gives me
           something to type about, in my column.

          INT. BERKELEY APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

          Margaret is asleep. Suddenly Walter bursts in, drunk and
          jocular. He FLIPS on the lights.

                          WALTER
           Ding-a-ling! Wake up, we're a HIT!
          Margaret rolls over, groggy. Walter jumps on the bed,
          grinning. He tosses her a HANDFUL OF MONEY.

                          WALTER
           What a night! I sold out all your Big
           Eyes!!
          She rubs her eyes, amazed.

                          MARGARET
           There must be two-hundred dollars...

                          WALTER
           They adore you! Cause of that
           article, the joint was PACKED. And
           then, a famous journalist showed up,
           and -- I need more paintings! Now!
          He hungrily KISSES her. She laughs.

                          MARGARET
           Walter, they take at least a week.
           There's layering, shading --

                          WALTER
           Of course! But, this is opportunity!
           Ah, we're gonna make a crackerjack
           team: Me schmoozing up the club, while
           you're back here, doing what you love!
          She stares at him -- then smiles. MUSIC...

          Walter sells Big Eyes. Shoving cash into a cigar box.

          Margaret works, HUMMING serenely. On the easel is a half-
          finished blonde girl in a blue dress.

          Walter buys a new suit. A TAILOR measures him.

          INT. APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

          Margaret finishes painting a sad boy, using a fine brush to
          add a watery rim to his eyes. Magically, this detail brings
          the picture to life. She's pleased.
          Margaret signs "KEANE." There are two finished canvases, the
          sad little girl and boy. Margaret smiles, her heart swelling.
          She loves them. Then, she looks about. Nobody is there to
          share the moment.
          Hm. She thinks -- then picks up the PHONE. She dials.

                          MARGARET
           Mrs. Cava, I'm sorry to bother you so
           late... but would you mind watching
           Jane?

          INT. TAXI - NIGHT

          Margaret rides in the back seat, smiling, her gaze faraway.
          She proudly hugs the bundled paintings to her chest.

          INT. HUNGRY I - NIGHT

          The club is pounding. Margaret enters the throng, carrying
          her work. She looks up -- and has her breath taken away. The

          ENTIRE CLUB, EVERY WALL, IS NOW HUNG WITH KEANE PAINTINGS!
          Whoa...! Pure joy envelops her.
          Then -- she gets jostled. Margaret notices Walter holding
          court with some GROUPIES. She approaches, unnoticed:

          glides into the club -- a vision of perfection with his slick

          gets distracted. By one of Margaret's Big Eye PAINTINGS.
          Walter gasps. He nudges Margaret.
          Olivetti peers at the artwork. Intrigued. Then -- excited.
          He starts gesturing and yapping in ITALIAN. The Blondes shout
          back. Everyone is getting worked-up.
          The big-bosomed Blonde turns to Walter.

           who is the artist?

          ANGLE - MARGARET AND WALTER
          The moment of truth. Margaret opens her mouth... and no sound
          comes out. She clenches up. Stomach tight. Mute.
          Walter gives her a second -- tick tock tick tock. Then -- he
          leaps into Opportunity. He SMACKS his hands.

           It sounds like your husband is trying
           to make the best of an imperfect
           situation.

                          (BEAT)
           You were raised Christian, so you know
           what we are taught: The man is head of
           the household.

          INT. KEANE GALLERY - NIGHT

          Opening night! The gallery is packed with the IN CROWD: Rich
          and drinking. The space is cool -- the walls bright white,
          the art hanging under spotlights. JAZZ plays on the stereo.
          At one painting, a HIPSTER COUPLE stares at the image of a
          sorrowful girl holding an armful of poodle puppies.

                          HIPSTER LADY
           I think it's creepy, maudlin and
           amateurish.

                          HIPSTER MAN
           Exactly. I love it.
          We move in tight on the painting. Underneath is a tag:
          "BEDTIME, by WALTER KEANE. Oil on canvas."
          We drift along, to another painting: "CALICO CAT, by WALTER
          KEANE." Then, another: "IN THE GARDEN, by WALTER KEANE."
          Every painting is now by Walter Keane.
          We move along... finding the Tipsy Man chatting up Dick.

                          TIPSY MAN
           We got in early. We own three.

                          (HE TURNS)
           Thanks, doll.
          He tosses his empty to a PASSING LADY. We reveal the waitress
          is... Margaret. She carries a tray of pigs-in-a-blanket.
          Margaret looks shell-shocked -- faking a happy party face.
          A burst of LAUGHTER. Margaret turns.

          Walter and a group ROAR at a joke. A SEXY GIRL hands Walter
          one of the promo posters. He beams and lays it across her
          back... hugging her waist to "steady" himself as he signs.

          BACK ON MARGARET
          She frowns. Dee-Ann slides into view, slurping champagne.

           I'm curious about your technique. How

                          WALTER
           That? Oh, wow. Probably... months.
           First the thinking, the sketching, and
           then time with just me and the oils.

                          NOSY GUY
           "Oils"? But isn't that acrylic...?
          Huh? Walter glances at the painting, startled.

                          WALTER
           Oh --! You mean that painting! Uhh,
           sorry! It's like a jumble of ideas,
           rattling around in my brain!
          Beat.

                          NOSY GUY
           So where do you get your ideas?

           Why are they... images of children?
          Yikes. Walter starts to sweat. He didn't think this through.

           Well, er, I've just always loved kids.
           Though mostly I was influenced by my
           darling daughter...
          An odd beat.

           I remember when she was a baby...
          Walter gets a far-off look.

                          WALTER
           Yeah. Cute little thing. I'd stare
           into those big orbs. Sometimes I'd
           get out my Brownie and snap a photo...
           but... that's not subjective. You
           know? It doesn't capture your

           painting her...

           Keane's work is completely without

           has won no awards. He's only
           noteworthy for his appearances in a

           Mr. Keane is why society NEEDS critics!
           To protect them from such atrocities!
          Walter gapes at the TV, outraged. He suddenly grabs a PHONE.

          It's a factory. Big Eyes are everywhere. Margaret frenziedly
          works, surrounded by half-done canvases, solvents, easels.
          She's in a bathrobe -- a cigarette hanging from her lips.
          Startled, she looks up to see Walter.
          He gazes at all the art. At the bulbous faces, eyes watery
          and submissive, trapped in muddy yellows and dire browns. And
          then... Walter grins broadly.

           I dunno. I'm not really comfortable
           with this. Jane and I used to be so
           close... but -- now...

                          WALTER
           Ah, Jane's grand! She's eating ice
           cream! She has new shoes. She has a
           college fund.
          Beat.

                          MARGARET
           Maybe I'm lightheaded from the
           turpentine. I've been in here all day.

                          WALTER
           Well I don't want you feeling like a
           prisoner. Take a break!
          Walter glances at one PAINTING -- then does a take.

          ANGLE - PAINTING
          It's a child in a rusty alley, staring, aching for compassion.
          And, starting to cry. A single tear streams down her cheek.

           43.

                         

                          WALTER
           Is that a tear...? You've gone deep!
          Margaret bites her fingers, worried.

                          MARGARET
           Do you -- like it?

                          WALTER
           I love it! ...How'd you get the eyes
           so lifelike? Is it the highlights?

                          WALTER
           I'm trying! Ah, you know me. See --
           this is why I need your help! I want
           to go on tv, to defend our art.

                          MARGARET
           You're going to be on television?!

                          WALTER
           Yes! But... what will I say??

                          (BEAT)
           Meaning -- what compels me... to
           paint... these paintings??
          A bizarre pause. The two of them look around the room. At
          all the Big Eyes peering down at them.

                          MARGARET
           Maybe you have an unhealthy obsession
           with little girls.

           Good afternoon! Delighted!
           (he reaches the SEXY BLONDE
           CLERK and pinches her ass)
           How many sales today?

                          BLONDE CLERK
           "Sales?" None with this crowd.
          Walter's smile drops, surprised.

                          BLONDE CLERK
           These people are looky-loos! They
           can't afford the paintings. But we
           gave away a heap of posters!
          Huh? Walter peers, baffled. Suddenly -- a loud FRWWIPPPP!
          Walter whirls, startled. Outside, two GIRLS tear a big poster
          off the front window.
          Walter's eyes widen. Slowly, he turns back. At the counter,
          FOLKS and KIDS are grabbing free posters from a box.
          Walter stares. Processing this. And then... being struck by
          an idea of absolute genius...

          INT. STORAGE ROOM - SECONDS LATER

          Walter is on the telephone, peering through the doorway.
          Hiding from the customers. Spying. WHISPERING.

           WALTER (ON THE PHONE)
           It's the craziest thing. I started
           charging for the posters! First a
           nickel... then a dime.
           (struggling to whisper)
           YES, Maggie! It's cuckoo! So it got
           me thinkin': Would you rather sell a
           $500 painting, or a million cheaply-
           reproduced posters?!

           But we're husband and wife. We
           shouldn't have secrets...
          Margaret gulps, fretting. Finally, without options -- she
          flips over the canvas of the lonely blonde.
          And -- Walter is taken aback. His eyebrows raise, shocked.
          Margaret bites her lip. Will he go ballistic?

          ANGLE - WALTER
          He leans right up to the painting.
          His expression is inscrutable. Studying the technique. We
          have no idea what his emotion is.

                          WALTER
           It's a completely different style.

          Another PHOTO OP, but big: A CAMERA CREW rushes about. Lights
          get set-up. Walter, Margaret, and Jane work at easels.
          Walter dabs at a Big Eye. Margaret works on a sad, long-neck
          blonde. Jane paints a goofy flower, like any child.
          Dick Nolan takes notes.

          Walter steers Dick to Jane, cute at her little child's easel.

                          WALTER
           What a talent! Look at these Keanes!
           If you cut open our veins, we bleed
           oil! Er -- turpentine.

           Uh, Dick, you know what I'm goin' for.

           Who's that?

           Ah! A little treat! The fourth

          Margaret and Jane turn, confused. Walter whips open

          THE FRONT DOOR
          Revealing LILY, 10, a quiet girl in bobbed hair. She holds a
          little overnight bag.
          A Buick HONKS, and Walter waves as it drives away. Walter
          stares at the girl, then puts on big hammy airs.

                          WALTER
           Lily, honey, how are you?!
          He gives her a giant hug. She responds stiffly -- a girl who
          doesn't see her father too often.

                          LILY
           I'm fine, Dad. I lost a tooth.

           Yeah, Walter Keane and Gauguin have a
           lot in common. They both walked away
           from successful careers to travel the
           globe, live on a boat...
          We move... finding Margaret alone in a small ANNEX. It
          displays a few of her sad blondes, alongside Jane and Lily's
          paintings of flowers and Mr. Potato-Head. Margaret sits,
          seeming like an adult at the children's table.
          An urbane RICH MAN glides by... and is taken with one of
          Margaret's nubile blondes. He gazes at the lounging figure.
          Margaret sits up. Alert, pleased with his interest.
          She tingles. Then, happily excited, unable to hold it in:

                          MARGARET
           I painted it!

                          RICH MAN

          He smiles flirtatiously. She smiles shyly and shrugs.

           57.

                         
          He steps forward -- then peers closer at the painting. The
          SIGNATURE is a feminine scroll: "MDH Keane"

                          RICH MAN
           "MDH"? You're so... mysterioso.

                          MARGARET
           Yes, we don't use my name, since
           people don't take women's art
           seriously.

                          (BEAT)
           "MDH" are my initials. And more! I'm
           interested in numerology... and as you

           Luckily, my maiden name is Margaret

           of the alphabet, "D" is 4, "H" 8! If
           you add up 1 and 3 in 13, that gives
           you 4, making 4 plus 4 plus 8 equals
           16, then 1 plus 6 equals seven!
          The man's head is spinning. He's lost all interest.
          Across the room, Walter sees this debacle. He marches over.

                          WALTER

           Two nuts that fell from the same tree!

                          SNOBBY ARTIST #2
           Because that nut's a genius! He sells
           paintings! Then he sells pictures of
           the paintings! Then he sells postcards
           of pictures of the paintings.

          Ruben is walking past -- then stops, pained. A window display
          of Keane Big Eyes shares space with paintings of CUTESY
          KITTENS lapping up milk.
          We WIDEN, revealing a whole wall of rip-offs! All with odd

          The Margaret sweatshop is going full-blast. Canvases are
          everywhere: Melancholy MDH ladies. Woeful Keane kids. Even a
          portrait of Natalie Wood, copied from a photo. Margaret dips
          a tiny brush, quickly detailing the tear on a child's cheek...
          when the doorbell CHIMES.
          Hm? Margaret puts down her brush, wipes her hands, then
          hurries out. She opens the door... REVEALING THAT WE'RE IN A
          DIFFERENT HOUSE. A GIANT, PHENOMENAL 1960s EXTRAVAGANZA.

          INT. WOODSIDE HOUSE - SAME TIME

          Margaret runs across the marble floors, past the swooping,
          Modern lines of a California ranch... all-white furniture... a
          kidney-shaped pool glistening blue outside the glass... a cute
          TOY POODLE barking at the door.

           Oh, is that your studio?
          Margaret turns -- and gasps.

                          MARGARET
           No --! You can't go in --

                          DEE-ANN
           I just want a peek. See what the

                          MARGARET
           Dee-Ann, please! STOP --
          Margaret rushes to block her -- but Dee-Ann pushes open the
          door, revealing...

          INT. PAINTING ROOM

          A room full of MDHs and Keanes.
          Dee-Ann stops, puzzled. She glances at Margaret -- who has
          turned white as a ghost.
          Immensely curious, Dee-Ann slowly enters. She peers around at
          the two styles of paintings...
          A strained silence. Finally, Margaret whispers.

                          MARGARET
           W-Walter paints in here too.
          Hmm.
          Dee-Ann walks about, examining the canvases. Then, her gaze
          settles on the Big Eye that Margaret was working on.
          Below the easel is the wet brush on the open jar of paint.
          Margaret sucks in her breath. Dee-Ann sees this.

                          DEE-ANN
           Is Walter home??
          Margaret has no answer.
          The two friends look at each other... Dee-Ann waiting...
          wondering if Margaret is going to lie to her...

           You KNOW I don't like anyone seeing my

          Walter rushes to the Waif, then for show grabs up the wet
          brush and quickly starts to "finish" the painting.
          Suddenly -- an odd expression crosses his face. He eyeballs
          the canvas, realizing he doesn't know what to do.
          A furtive glance. Then, unbowed, he hastily dips the brush
          and slaps a little black onto the shaded background.
          Walter spins, victorious.

           No. I can never come. No! I

          Jane glares glumly.
          Margaret peers hopelessly at her daughter... then goes inside.

          INT. WOODSIDE HOUSE

          Margaret strolls to her studio. WE SEE the poodle scampering
          behind her on its cute little legs. She enters the

          INT. PAINTING ROOM

          Margaret doesn't notice the tiny dog follow her in. She LOCKS
          the door, then turns -- surprised.

                          MARGARET
           Where did you appear from? Didn't you
           hear? No visitors!
          Rembrandt wags his tail, his little eyes bright. Margaret
          peers.

                          MARGARET
           Is this what it's come to? You're the
           only living soul I can tell my secret?
           (she lowers her voice)
           Well -- I painted them all!
           (she shudders with release)
           It's TRUE! I did every single one --
          She gestures, then catches sight of a Walter street scene.

                          MARGARET
           Well, every one except that street
           scene.

                          (BEAT)
           But I did the rest. Every Big Eye!
           And nobody will ever know. But YOU.
          Rembrandt pants and BARKS.
          Margaret chuckles, then goes to work. She pulls a CURTAIN
          across the sliding glass door. At her easel, she squirts a
          tube into a well and starts mixing colors.
          Rembrandt jumps on the couch.

          Margaret goes over to a CLOSET. Rembrandt follows, curious.

          IN THE CLOSET
          Margaret turns on the bare bulb inside. It's filled with old
          easels... cans... junk...

                          MARGARET
           I think there's a scrap back here...
          She rummages, sliding the junk aside. In back is a TATTERED

          WOODEN CRATE.
          Hm?

                          MARGARET
           Well what's this?
          Margaret swings the bulb closer. The crate is covered with
          SHIPPING INSTRUCTIONS and international markings.
          Margaret's interest is piqued. She tugs at the lid, pulling
          it off. Revealing inside a STACK OF STREET SCENE PAINTINGS.
          Ten or fifteen of Walter's canvases.
          Or so it seems.

          TIGHT - MARGARET
          She peers closer.

          TIGHT - THE PAINTINGS
          The top painting is a typical Parisian street scene: Cobble
          stones, a man carrying baguettes, an old lady selling roses...
          But down in the bottom corner is the signature: "S. CENIC"

          TIGHT - MARGARET
          She sucks in her breath, shocked. She examines the painting.
          Then, she hurriedly grabs the next canvas. It's another
          sunlit scene: A quaint Parisian cafe, a man playing accordian,
          and in the bottom right corner... the signature: "S. CENIC"
          WHAT?! Margaret grabs the next canvas. "S. CENIC"
          The next canvas.
          The next canvas!
          They all are signed "S. CENIC"
          Margaret starts hyperventilating.

           66.

                         
          She thinks, then suddenly bolts from the closet.

          A grandfather clock says 10:15. Margaret sits gloomily,
          staring at the clock. Clutching a drink.

                         LATER
          2:30 a.m. Margaret still stares at the clock. She's stewing.
          Suddenly, keys in the door. Walter swings in, tanked and full
          of life. He skids across the marble, humming to himself --
          when -- he's startled by his wife. He jerks.

                          WALTER
           I had a helluva night. Worked three
           or four clubs.
           (he winks, loosey-goosey)
           Stumbled onto some hot gossip: Madame
           Chiang Kai-shek is coming to town!
           Straight from Taipei! I think we
           should present her with a painting --
           get Dick to flack it...

                          (HE THINKS)
           Or the heck with Dick. I met a new
           guy at UPI...

                          MARGARET
           Maybe you should give her one of your
           street scenes.

                          (HAZY)
           You think? I dunno -- I thought you
           could whip off a doodle of Chinatown.
           With a cute little kid, sort of a big-
           eyed slanty-eyed thing...
          Margaret's anger is raging. She glares, steely.

          Margaret stares, eyes sharp.

                          MARGARET
           Cenic is the name of the artist who
           did all your early paintings.

                          WALTER
           Huhhh?
           (spinning his lie)
           Urgh... oh! CENIC!
           (he laughs crazily)
           Cenic was my nickname in Paris! All
           my art school pals loved my scenic
           views, so they called me "Scenic"!
           But since those Frogs can't pronounce
           a hard "e," I became "Cenic."
          He looks up at her hopefully.
          But she shakes her head.

                          MARGARET
           The more you lie, the smaller you seem.

                          WALTER
           (unyielding, scrambling)
           How DARE you accuse me of lying! I'm
           proud of my early Cenics!

                          MARGARET
           Then why do you paint over the name?
          Walter gasps, floored.
          Margaret bores in.

          He nods.

          INT. HOUSE - LATER

          Margaret sits, unmoving, trapped in the big house. Outside, a
          JAPANESE GARDENER trims the hedges.
          Margaret stares at the walls, a smothering Walter Hall of
          Fame: Framed magazine articles on Walter, smugly posed with
          the Waifs.
          She swallows, then gently opens a dresser drawer. Inside is
          an ORIGINAL WAIF from long ago. A small oil of Jane, when she
          was a toddler.
          Margaret stares... and then her face slowly crumbles.

          INT. PAINTING ROOM - DAY

          Margaret huddles with a SKETCHPAD. Rembrandt is at her feet.
          She's drawing. She looks up, as Walter anxiously enters.
          He's holding a drink. He clears his throat.

                          WALTER
           What are you working on?

           A new MDH. Something for me. It's
           about a woman trapped in an uncaring
           world. I call it, "Escape."
          Walter bites his lip, afraid to talk.

                          WALTER
           I figured out a solution to our
           problems.

          INT. PAINTING ROOM - MONTAGE:

          Margaret easily outlines a head, then two circles for eyes.
          Walter tries copying, but his eyes are misshapen.
          Again, Walter copies, but he's wobbly. Angry, he scratches it
          out.
          Margaret tries to help, guiding his hand. Insulted, he pushes
          her off. He CRUMPLES the page.
          NEW TACTIC: Walter grabs her sketch. He puts it on a LIGHT-
          TABLE. Despairing, he starts to trace it..

                         LATER
          Walter finally paints. We can't see the canvas, but he's very
          meticulous. His expression quite earnest. He adds a final

          filling half the room. Margaret is in the throes of hastily
          creating the MASTERPIECE.
          Sketches are tacked everywhere. Margaret is chain smoking,
          sleep-deprived. The DESIGN is a staggering multiracial CROWD
          of children, mournful, extending to the horizon.
          Walter enters, silently scrutinizing.

          Hawaii, paradise indeed. A dense, tropical forest of deep
          greens and giant blooming flowers.
          Margaret stands on the porch of her small, lovely house,
          breathing in the clean air. She looks lightened.
          In a clearing, Jane plays with some LOCAL TEENS.

          INT. HAWAIIAN HOUSE - SAME TIME

          The house is simple. In one light-filled corner is an EASEL.
          Margaret is painting Nature: Splaying ferns. Wild succulents.
          In the window, a BIRD flies by, its plumage a dazzling red.
          Margaret thinks -- then takes out a tube of RED PAINT. She
          starts to apply the vivid color onto her canvas...
          When -- a RINGING PHONE. Margaret reacts, startled.
          This is unexpected. And unsettling. It RINGS. RINGS.
          RINGS. Finally, she hurries to her one telephone, mounted on
          the kitchen wall. She slowly answers it.

           Whew. It hurts to hear you say those

          Silence. He is feigning "hurt feelings." Struggling for a
          response. Finally, his thoughts sharpen up, smart and shrewd.

          then sees something odd.

          OUTSIDE THE WINDOW
          Coming down the long driveway are two FIGURES. Two small
          WOMEN, patiently walking toward the isolated house.
          Margaret stares, puzzled. The women come closer. They are
          Asian, dressed in formal dresses. Curious, Margaret creeps
          over, spying on them...
          They walk up and ring the bell. DING-DONG! An unsure beat...
          then Margaret opens the door. The ladies smile politely.

          Walter smiles triumphantly -- until -- his happiness melts

           Mr. Keane. There has been a lot of
           innuendo and contradictory testimony
           about the genesis of the "big-eyed
           waifs." Would you mind clarifying to
           this court, once and for all, who
           spawned these paintings?
          Walter sprints back into the witness stand. He sits, then
          reacts coyly, as if he's surprised.

                          WALTER
           Why -- I created the children.
          Walter starts to stand again -- but the Judge SLAMS his bench.

                          JUDGE
           The choreography is not necessary.
           Just sit down and testify.
          Oh. Walter sits, then gathers his thoughts...
          We slowly PUSH IN. He smiles, wistfully...

                          WALTER
           I've had a wonderful life. I've been
           an artist, a world traveler, a friend
           of untold celebrities...
           (he gets misty-eyed)
           But when I look back at it all, when I
           peer into my heart and define what
           mattered...

          A look between them -- and then she cocks a half-smile and

		Okay. Well, one day my father

		just started screaming at her -- 
		at us -- at evil. And... 

				MELVIN
			(very quickly)
		... my father didn't leave his

		Go ahead, Simon. Your father

		and... really, come on.

				SIMON
		I was trying to defend my mother 
		and make peace, in the lamest way. 
		I said, "she's not naked -- it's 
		art." And then he started hitting

		After that he talked to me less

		for college, my dad came into my 
		room. He held out his hand. It 
		was filled with money. A big wad 
		of sweaty money.

    A strange ROARING sound...


    CLOSE ON A YOUNG WOMAN

    ...in darkness. Light begins to spill on her from the right
    - revealing her face, lost in thought. This is RACHEL
    SINGER - pretty, painfully young looking. A surgical
    dressing covers half her face.

    As we pull back a little we see that two YOUNG MEN sit
    either side of her. They are STEPHAN GOLD (thirties) thick-
    set, capable, and DAVID PERETZ (late twenties), dark-haired
    and pale-faced.

    The three faces in the darkness, each looking straight
    ahead - something from a Caravaggio painting.

    The roaring, which we realise is the sound of ENGINES,
    gradually runs down into silence.

    The light from the bay door which is opening off-screen
    begins to flood the scene with HARSH DAYLIGHT, revealing
    the inside of a CARGO PLANE.

    Stephan turns to look at the growing light. Then he turns
    to Rachel.

                         STEPHAN
              Breathe.

    He stands. Rachel turns to look at David but he is standing
    too, his face a mask.
    Rachel gathers herself, then stands and turns to follow the
    other two, walking towards the light.

    As the three approach the opening and descend the ramp of
    the bay door, we hear a woman's voice:

                         SARAH (V.O)
              We should never forget how young
              they were.

EXT.  ISLAND - DAY

The monsoon pours down.  Wind whips the palm trees.  The
waves are gray and angry, tearing at the beach.

INT.  CAVE - DAY

As the rain pours down outside, Chuck studies the sodden,
ruined photograph of Kelly, which is really only a gray mess.

          She's probably found someone else.  I
          would have.

Chuck dips his finger into one of the bowls of colors and
streaks it slowly across his face.  To exorcise his
loneliness, he will paint on the most expressive canvas there
is:  his own body.

CHUCK PAINTING HIMSELF - MONTAGE

Close-up on scarred fingers, as they paint on Chuck's face
and body.  Color on skin.  Tight dramatic shots of Chuck
being transformed.

Chuck takes white paint and covers his hand.  Then he presses
it into his chest and makes a handprint.  He draws a yellow
spiral on his leg, then takes red and makes jagged lightning
bolts on his chest on either side of the hand.

WATER

Shimmers in a gourd.  Chuck's face swims into focus.  It has
been painted white.  Looking at himself in the reflection, he
dots on blue stars with dark blue from squid ink.

EXT.  CAVE - LATER

The rains have stopped.  The island is washed bright and
green.

ON CHUCK

As he stands up in the cove.  His face is white with blue
stars.  Handprints circle his torso, flanked by red lightning
bolts.  Braided cords circle his biceps.  Bone necklaces hang
from his neck.  Feathers jut out from his hair.

EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY

Chuck goes from tree to tree, making handprints along his
path.  Chuck was here.  This is his mark.

		Come on, let's go.
 
They all get up except Claudia. She is left so completely shaken by the

move. Giulia, after giving Corrado a defiant look, turns and smiles at the 
young man who had stopped to wait for her.

				GOFFREDO 
		Anybody can hold a brush in his hand. All you 
		need is to buy some oils and start painting. 
		Even Rembrandt did the same.
 
Giulia laughs with a strange sense of excitement, then takes Goffredo by the 
arm and leaves. Claudia remains alone. She watches the group heading towards 
the house,  Giulia holding tight to  Goffredo, Ettore  to Patrizia. Their 
voices are heard, somewhat unclear.

after a few steps through the corridor, they separate with a friendly gesture 
towards each other. Patrizia goes into her room while Claudia prepares to 
descend the wide stairway. Coming up the same stairway are Giulia and the 
young Prince, Goffredo.  There is something of an embarrassing moment between 
them. Then Giulia, aware of Claudia's presence, detaches herself from 
Goffredo and, as they reach the top of the stairs, she comes over to Claudia 
and takes her by the wrist in order to confide with her more intimately.

She laughs with an obvious sense of amusement, but she is also tickled by her 
own vanity. Claudia looks at her without knowing what to say to her.

		Please, you come too...

Seeing the two of them arriving together, the young Prince feels 
disappointed. But he knows he has to cover his intentions with a show of good 
manners. When the two women reach the top of the stairs, he bows to Claudia 
in a most respectful fashion. Then he leads them down a low and narrow 
corridor to a door they pass through.
 
The attic is bright and spacious, with slanted roof, and two huge windows. It 
is filled with paintings, easels, canvases, brushes and oils. As soon as 
Giulia enters the studio, she moves away from Claudia and attaches herself to 
the young Prince who is setting up one of his paintings on an easel beside 
one of the windows. Claudia looks around the room with a sense of 
indifference. Going over to the window, she looks out and sees a vast 
panorama of the countryside. 

Giulia looks at the painting with a certain amount of surprise. It is a 
picture of a nude woman; a shapely figure, slightly plump, in the manner of 
Renoir.

		Claudia, come and see. It's a nude.
 
Claudia is looking through the paintings that lean up against the wall face 
backwards. She turns one around: a nude woman. A second: another nude woman. 
A third: the same.

D'Artagnan bows, steps to the lifesize portrait of Louis

INT.  A DARK APARTMENT IN PARIS - NIGHT

The lock rattles, and the door swings open.  D'Artagnan
enters, lifting a lantern to throw light on the dark room.
It is Athos' apartment, the one he visited earlier; now he
finds it empty, devoid of clues.  He stands there alone.

He turns to leave, then glimpses a familiar painting hanging
beside the door.  Lifting his light he studies the portrait:
Athos, Aramis, Porthos and himself -- four Musketeers, beat
friends, in their prime.  Together then, inseparable.

          The stage door slams shut. Ali picks up the strand of beads.
          Holds them up in the light, watching them shimmer.
          She goes to the front of club, where a smattering of L.A.
          HIPSTERS enter. There's a GLASS DISPLAY CASE full of photos
          of the acts. Ali looks at the pictures of the Girls in their
          elaborate costumes and provocative poses.
          She's unintentionally made her way to the front door. Black
          curtains obscure her view inside. She peers in. HEARS cool

          Ali MOVES down a DIMLY LIT HALLWAY. More beautiful photos of

          The phones in the master control booth and ringing off the
          hook...the public's reaction to Ali's Bre'r Rabbit routine.
          Ali used his ability to command presence in media to promote

                   You want me to buy you a drink?
          Ali's dad sits on a crate, painting the door of a delivery
          truck. He looks up...Ali is there. Emotion wells up in
          both men. The younger "rebelistic" son, seeing his father,
          who is so like him. The older hep-cat who got cheated by
          life of his potential and promise. In this case, his boy,
          his boy's name, pride and reflected glory...

          He's out! Ali is victorious! His fist is raised. His
          cartoon face shouts his victory...the people's champion.
          There's more. There's knocked-out white policemen, knocked-
          out black soldiers, knocked-out landlords, knocked-out South
          Africa, knocked-out planes and tanks, knocked-out tse-tse
          flies...everything!
          
          So much, it means "ALL"...all expectation. This childish
          painting powerfully affects Ali. The kids look at him.

	light. She is utterly real and entirely nude. The folds of
	her flesh almost seem to glow ...

Abner calls from another wagon.

				ABNER
		Colonel, we got a wagon full of
		officer's uniforms and more powder
		and muskets here.

Ignoring Abner, Marion, sits down on a stump with a pile
of Cornwallis' papers and starts to read.

EXT.  SNOW'S ISLAND - NIGHT

Marion sits at Cornwallis' ornate, folding campaign desk,
reading Cornwallis' journal, surrounded by Cornwallis'
field gear which includes furniture, music boxes, oil
paintings and an elaborate folding commode.  The TWO GREAT
DANES sit nearby, eyeing Marion warily.

The men have divided themselves into two groups, one
coarse, the other civilized, each clustered around a
separate fire.

The coarse men, including Dalton, Brother Joseph and
RANDOLPH, a grizzled, black-toothed mountain man, drink
and laugh loudly, wearing Cornwallis' wigs askew.

The civilized men, including Rev. Oliver, Gabriel, Scott,
Fielding and Abner, talk quietly.

Marion puts down the journal and walks over to the
campfire where the rougher men are gathered.  He stands
just inside the firelight and speaks loudly, so that all
can hear:

				MARION
		Today was hard earned but a good
		start.

Marion looks at Dalton, then turns to the other men as
well.

				MARION
		In the future wounded British
		soldiers will be given quarters.

				DALTON
		Like they gave quarter to my family?
		My wife and three children were
		hiding in our root cellar when they
		came.  The Redcoats locked the door
		and torched the house.

				MARION
		You have my sympathy... but the
		order stands.

                         These are all valid comments, but I 
                         think we should see if the artist 
                         has anything to bring to this.

                         Well, I got the idea when I was doing 
                         some research and I discovered that 
                         Cook's Chicken used to be called 
                         Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to 
                         do my project based on this discovery 
                         as kind of a comment on racism... 
                         and the way racism is whitewashed 
                         over in our culture...

                         And how do you think this addresses 
                         the subject of racism?

                         It's complicated... I guess I'm trying 
                         to show how racism used to -- more 
                         out in the open and now it's hidden, 
                         or something...

                                     ROBERTA
                         And how does an image like this help

           The bathtub was in the kitchen
           and took forever to fill up.

He snorts part of his line, anyway, to make sure.

INT. PARTY - NIGHT

The party's winding down - hip-hop kids, Lower East Side types.
Jean and Benny pass through the room, ignoring the two or three
clusters of people - maybe fifteen in all...

Jean encounters a familiar face: an enormous red-haired dealer -
ROCKETS (35). They greet each other as friends.

Rockets leads Jean aside. They stand near a wall where a painting
hangs ("Flats Fixed"). It bears Jean's three-point crown.

                        ROCKETS
             You did that, didn't you?

Jean shrugs.

                         BASQUIAT
             I gave it to Maripol. She let me stay here
             for awhile.

Jean hands him twenty dollars. Rockets hands him two dime bags.
As if thinking better, he hands the bill back to Jean.

                       ROCKETS
            Do one for me and it's free. How's that?

Jean re-pockets his money. He gestures to Rockets as if to say
"fine - it's a deal."

He and Benny sit down across the room and split a bag onto the
window, as before. This time, it's good. They lean back into it,
slumping down into the couch.

Nearby, Rene sits on a couch with THREE STREET KIDS - artists
(who we've seen at Milo's opening). They sit on their knees
looking out a window passing binoculars back and forth.

ARTIST #1 looks through the window with a pair of BINOCULARS. He
points down towards the street, trying to get Rene's attention.

Rene weaves across the room. Suddenly, he stops cold. He's
staring at Jean's painting. He doesn't move.

           Fuck, man, where'd he go? Where's Jean?

           I don't know. I told you, this isn't my
           apartment.

                      ARTIST #3
           I know who did that. That's Jean Michel's.

           Rene, man, check this out. Whoa... He's
           kinda cute.

Rene looks to him and back at the painting. He takes one last
look.

He stumbles towards the window and grabs the binoculars from
Artist #1..

We look through the binoculars' POV at a GUY coming down the
street. He's wearing all black, cowboy boots, and sunglasses.

                      RENE
           Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick.

           Just look at him.

                  (Rene hands the binoculars to
                  him)
           Little silver thingies on his cowboy boots?
           Honey, I don't think so.

He looks around the room again as if looking for Jean.

Jean pauses before one of his own graffiti pieces:

"PLUSH SAFE, HE THINK"

Rene watches in awe. Jean, moving a bit slowly, `signs' his tag
with the copyright sign. He walks off.

           MOTHAFUCKAH!

He hands the binoculars to Artist #3 and runs towards the door.

BINOCULARS POV

We watch as Rene looks frantically for Jean, but can't spot him.
Finally he sees Jean's hair-do bobbing up and down a block away.
He runs towards it.

CLOSE ON: A HAMMER, POUNDING

Jean pounds a nail into one of his pieces, nailing it directly
onto the wall. Everyone stares.

                       RENE
            Oh child... You got no respect. Didn't
            anyone teach you how to mount paintings?

Rene smiles. Jean finishes pounding the last piece into the wall.

CAMERA pulls back to reveal several of Jean's paintings - found
objects with paint on them.

There seems to be a buzz about Jean already. People gather around
his paintings.

Gina arrives. She looks great.

Jean sees Bruno and turns his back to her.

Bruno looks at the paintings with a smile... He gives a cheerful
nod to Annina.

           You're doing well.

INT. GINA'S APARTMENT (KITCHEN) - LATER (NIGHT)

Quietly, Jean kneels on the floor of the kitchen. He paints on an
old window.

He draws figures of three people sitting at a table - obviously a
family. He crosses out one person and paints a dog under the
table.

He crosses everything out.

He mixes the paint in a large bowl and starts again.

Again, he crosses everything out.

           If you're so smart, why are you here with

                       RENE
           You're news. I want the scoop. I write it
           down. When I speak, no one believes me. But
           when I write it down, people know it's
           true.
                  (beat)
           There's never been a black painter in art
           history that's been considered really
           important, you know?

           5:11.

Jean regards a near-finished painting. He writes "5:11" on it. He
crosses it out and re-writes it, "Rene 5:11." Rene looks pleased.

                      BASQUIAT
           That one's for you.

Jean continues painting. Rene slumps down onto the floor, happy -
a parasite content to have a host, impressed with Jean's
limitless energy. Rene closes his eyes.

Milo takes his time looking at the paintings.

Jean continues to work, never wanting to appear impressed by
anyone. He walks on top of the paintings.

Albert and Rene begin to ascend the stairs. Jean continues

JEAN'S POV

We see Annina's legs coming down the stairs.


REVEAL

A man wearing a pin-striped suit and gold-rimmed glasses. The
woman is wrapped in a cashmere shawl.

                        ANNINA NOSEI (O.S)
             Tom and Cynthia Kruger.

                        BASQUIAT (O.S)
             I know.

We SEE that Jean continues to paint, looking down.

                         ANNINA NOSEI
             This is Jean Michel Basquiat.
                    (beat)
             You've seen the SAMO graffiti everywhere.
             That's his. This is the true voice of the
             gutter.

As she speaks, Jean squirms. He grabs a banana from a fruit bowl.
Without peeling it, he takes a big bite. And another. And
another. Everyone looks uncomfortable. Annina starts showing them
the paintings.

                        CYNTHIA KRUGER
             We've seen the graffiti. I work on Wall
             Street. And I've heard wonderful things
             about the paintings. Everybody's talking
             about you.

                        BASQUIAT
             Yeah.

He looks up at them, eating the banana.

                         ANNINA NOSEI
             Here's a very good example of his recent
             work that's not spoken for yet.
                    (beat)
             He's got to work in a basement. He's got so
             much energy that if he worked in a place
             with a window, he'd jump right through it.
             Most of these are reserved already. After
             this week, this work will not be available.

             ... I don't know.... This one's nice, but I
             don't know if I could live with it. That
             green is so... institutional.

He (Kruger) looks up to see two KIDS enter - young black artists,
one of whom we saw with Rene at the loft party.

They walk right into the middle of the room, completely oblivious

ignore the kid..

INT. ANNINA NOSEI GALLERY - NIGHT

Silence.


CLOSE UP PAINTING

We read the words:

"BOOM #2
A CAT POURING TACKS ON ITS TONGUE"

SOMEONE (the big red-haired dealer we met earlier) walks in front
of us.

CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a crowd in a gallery. It is literally
filled with people. Again - all this takes place in silence.

We begin to HEAR Peggy Lee's "Is That All There Is?" It colors
the motion of the crowd.

           How does it feel to have a genius in the
           family?

                      FATHER
           It feels... good!

Jean notices Benny across the room. He slows down and waves.

Jean sees Gina across the room wearing the scarf.

Just beyond her, he sees Big Pink approaching.

There must be ten people between them.

He moves towards her. Suddenly, directly in front of him are the
Krugers.

           Which painting?

                      TOM KRUGER
           The green one.

           Hello, Jean.

                      JACK MILO
           Hi, John... Are your parents here?

                      BASQUIAT
           Well.
                  (inhaling)
           My dad's here with his wife. My mom
           couldn't make it.

He offers the joint to Albert's mother.

                       ESTHER MILO
                  (waving it away)
           No thanks.

Everyone laughs.

                  (to Jean)
           I'd like to do a show with you.
                  (pointing to "Rene 5:11"
                  painting)
           I'm especially interested in that one. I'd
           like to buy it for myself.

Jean spots the very word on the painting ("Rene 5:11") and
freezes for a second.

                      BASQUIAT
           I wasn't gonna sell this one.

He looks around the room for Rene, but doesn't see him. Bruno
remains smiling, waiting for an answer.

                      BRUNO
           You shouldn't have put it in the show. This
           is the one I absolutely have to have. I
           really love it.

                        BASQUIAT
           Sure, ok..

Jean wants out. He feels compromised.

Jean makes his way through the crowd, as we see images of the

                      INTERVIEWER (O.S, CONT'D)
           ... had over fifty articles written about
           you, switched galleries - how many times? -
           DJ'd in the hottest clubs -

Jean looks out the window, yawns and rubs his eyes. He now sports
dreadlocks bundled into groups of spikes sticking out of his
head. He wears a wrinkled Wesleyan College T-shirt, paint-
splattered jeans, and no shoes; just out of bed, it would seem.

An INTERVIEWER - a balding Brit with all the humor of a bank
clerk - tries to buddy up with Jean on camera.

                       INTERVIEWER   (CONT'D)
           ... one of the youngest    artists ever to be
           included in the Whitney    Biennial, also
           produced a rap record.    It's said you're
           quite the ladies man -    even dated Madonna
           for a couple months!!!
                  (takes a breath)
           All at the ripe old age    of 24. One might
           ask: is there anything    left for Jean Michel
           Basquiat to do?

Jean and the interviewer face each other in front of one of
Jean's paintings. Jean stares at the interviewer, incredulous.

                       INTERVIEWER (CONT'D)
           What is it that gets you out of bed in the
           morning?
                  (nervous laugh)

                      BASQUIAT
           I hate this. Turn that off.

Jean walks off camera and disappears into his bedroom.

Shenge (the former limo driver, now working as Jean's assistant)
assembles stretchers.

           I use a lot of colors - not only black.

birds flying in the trees.

The birds. We see the statue in the middle of the park, but we
have no idea where we are until we see the Mays Dept. Store sign.
The birds circle in flocks, never lighting on the trees.


EXT. THE FACTORY (ENTRANCE) - DAY

Jean presses a buzzer. He's admitted. He carries his bike on his
shoulder.


INT. THE FACTORY - DAY

Jean enters a broad, high-ceilinged studio. It's neat. Paintings
lie on the floor.

Andy's back is turned to him. As Jean gets closer, he sees that
Andy's assistant FRANK is peeing on canvas covered with copper
pigment. We hear the SOUND of the piss.

Frank holds a bottle of beer in his hand.

birds flying in the trees.


ANGLE ON

The birds. We see the statue in the middle of the park, but we
have no idea where we are until we see the Mays Dept. Store sign.
The birds circle in flocks, never lighting on the trees.


EXT. THE FACTORY (ENTRANCE) - DAY

Jean presses a buzzer. He's admitted. He carries his bike on his
shoulder.


INT. THE FACTORY - DAY

Jean enters a broad, high-ceilinged studio. It's neat. Paintings
lie on the floor.

Andy's back is turned to him. As Jean gets closer, he sees that
Andy's assistant FRANK is peeing on canvas covered with copper
pigment. We hear the SOUND of the piss.

Frank holds a bottle of beer in his hand.

                      ANDY WARHOL
           A little more to the right, Frank. OK...
           Good. Now up... You got a little more?

Jean notices a bunch of Andy's wigs on a desk.

                      BASQUIAT
           What's with the wigs?

                      ANDY WARHOL
           I'm going to send them to my friends for
           Christmas presents.

           You think those are good presents? Who
           wants an old wig?

Jean makes a grimace. He walks up to the painting Frank's peeing
on.

           Piss painting?

           Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It
           makes a good green.

Jean and Andy collaborate on a large canvas. Andy outlines a
Mobil Oil winged horse.

Jean paints it out. To the side he paints a penguin with a hat.

           Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously,
           Jean. That's why you can't stop taking
           drugs. You always think people don't like
           you. Everyone likes you.

Jean paints out part of Andy's logo.

                      ANDY    WARHOL
           Bruno called. In    Europe, people are saying
           you're gonna die    from drugs. They think
           they can cash in    on your death.

                      BASQUIAT
           When I was poor, everybody doubted I could
           make it. When I got rich, everyone said,
           `yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' Now
           everyone says `he's killing himself.' So I
           clean up, and then they say `Look. His
           art's dead.' I don't take drugs, anyway.
           I'm healthy now.

Jean obliterates Andy's logo.

                      ANDY WARHOL
           If you say so. You sleep until 5:00 p.m.
           You call at four in the morning. You never
           show up anywhere on time - if you show up.

Andy paints back in part of the horse.

           I can't even see what's good anymore.

Andy steps back and squints as he examines Jean's work.

                      ANDY WARHOL (CONT'D)
           Yeah, I see what you mean about the white.

The screen is filled with the cover of the New York Times
Magazine. Jean is featured on the cover, without his dreadlocks.


INT. GREAT JONES ST. LOFT - NIGHT

As Shenge opens the door, a CROWD of people spill out. They pour
into the loft. The studio is crowded with PEOPLE. (Many of them
we recognize from earlier scenes in Mudd Club, Jean's opening,
etc). On the wall there is a portrait of Jean by Andy. The
background is a piss painting.

Inside, Jean kneels on the floor in the corner of the loft with a
bunch of people around him - girls, mostly. Twenty-five copies of
the Times Magazine lay stacked on the floor.

Crouching on one knee, Jean signs a copy for a BRUNETTE.

INT. GREAT JONES ST. LOFT - DAY

Washed in sunlight, a large painting leans against the wall, the
words "HAITIAN BASEBALL FACTORIES" scrawled through its center.

Jean lays down, watching TV.

He looks older now, more worn. His face is slightly swollen. His
complexion is discolored.

Shenge covers a triptych with wide brush strokes of yellow paint.
He circles a large, primitive figure of a black man drawn with
magic marker in the center. He is careful to leave the figure
intact.

                      BASQUIAT
           Paint it out.

                       SHENGE

                      BASQUIAT
           Yeah... Maybe just his arms.

                  (Shenge paints out the arms)
           Put some Cerulean Blue there.

Jean points to the lower corner.

Shenge picks up the phone, which has been RINGING for some time.

Basquiat points at the painting.

           How much is something like that?

Jean raises his hand and pumps five fingers three times in the
air.

                      MARIA
           Fifteen. Reasonable.

Ellen makes a snotty face.

           It's unfinished.
                  (to Shenge)

Shenge gives Jean a stupefied look.

           Blue? Where?

women.

           Don't look at me like that. It hurts my
           feelings.

He points. Unsure, Shenge picks up the brush and paints one of
the corners.

Maria browses through a stack of paintings leaning against the
wall.

                      MARIA
           I love these.

           God... I just can't even care anymore.
           Compare this to a mountain or a tree.
           Who're y'all trying to kid? That's what I
           think. I was just in the Himalayas, and
           like - OK - is this important? No. I mean,

Jean gets to his feet. He dips a long, thin brush into black
paint and nonchalantly crosses out the half figure that Shenge is
carefully surrounding with blue.

She's not even worth a response. Jean looks around, numb.

Jean enters the gallery. Cleaned up. Healthier. Bruises healing.

                  (to Mary)
           It'll never fit.

                      MARY BOONE
           It'll be ok.

                      ALBERT MILO
           You better take a look. Why's your door so
           small? The ceilings are sixteen feet and
           your door's the size of a mouse hole!

                      MARY BOONE

           Why are your paintings so big? Just go
           home. I'll get it in.

                       ALBERT MILO

           Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk

INT. ALBERT MILO'S LOFT - DAY

Albert shows Jean through a series of large rooms filled with
enormous paintings.

It looks like the Cairo Museum.

They pause before a painting.

                      ALBERT MILO
           This is painted on a backdrop from the
           Kabuki theater in Japan. I painted it after
           Joseph Beuys died. A rebirth painting. I
           felt like he could've painted it, or maybe
           someone else was painting it instead of me.
           The Chinese calligraphers used to change
           their name mid-career so they could start
           over as someone else..

           it's written about in newspapers. I'm
           surprised when anybody comes to my

Hana comes through the Cloisters into the garden as the gurgling

28	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

Close on the HERODOTUS.  The Patient opens its cover, held together by 
leather ties.  Loose PAPERS, PHOTOGRAPHS, HAND-DRAWN MAPS AND SKETCHES 
are all collected between the pages.  He claws at some water-colors 
which appear to be based on CAVE PAINTINGS - figures, dark-skinned 
warriors of the stone age, some with bows in their hands, others with 
plumes in their hair - arranged in abstract patterns uncannily like 
those of Matisse.  Some appear to be swimming, another is diving.  Then 
the Patient loses control of the papers and the whole parcel SPILLS to 
the floor with a crack.

A SHOT RINGS OUT, disturbing the evening meal.  Alm�sy and others go

along the long thin line of stone.  The children watch intently.  He 
turns and bows.

               with opera posters; and over the fireplace there is a painting

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY

Vibius defeats an opponent -- he stands over him.  He
looks around at the crowd.  Then he tosses down his sword
and walks off.

The crowd goes mad with pleasure.  Vibius eats it up,
raising his arms and soaking up the applause.

Maximus watches from the holding cells.  He smiles.

The drums continue...

EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

Proximo supervises as a huge banner is unfurled.  It
covers the side of a tall building.

It shows a dramatic painting of Maximus.

Proximo supervises happily as torches and braziers are lit
to illuminate the mammoth banner.

The drums continue...

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY

The ending of a group fight -- Proximo's gladiators
triumphant.

The crowd waits for the delicious act of defiance.  We
note many placard and banners honoring "MAXIMUS THE
MERCIFUL."

Maximus, Vibius, Juba and a few other gladiators toss down
their weapons and walk off, leaving their opponents alive.

The crowd roars.  They have completely embraced Maximus
and his fellow gladiators.

Gracchus, in the stands, laughs.

The drums finally conclude.

and then braces herself, stands, and quickly leaves with
the Centurion.

          Around a bend, a decorative archway over the road, a town
          visible a few miles further on. They stop in their
          tracks. On one side of the timber structure a portrait
          of Josef Stalin. On the other the local Mongolian
          leader, a red star on his military cap. In the centre,
          the hammer and sickle over a painting of a brown hand
          shaking a white one. Small flags of both nations flap
          ominously.

          Dwight and Toby are painting the cabinets and kitchen
          table white.

          Everywhere we look is white, the walls, ceiling,
          furniture -- all of it. Only the old Baldwin upright
          piano has escaped painting. Dwight eyes it
          suspiciously.

          starts to paint the foot pedals.
65   H)   SAME SCENE - LATER                                     65
          Dwight's face tells us that something still doesn't
          suit him. He glances at Toby, Toby nods, and they
          converge on the piano.

          Very carefully, Dwight and Toby finish painting the
          dark ivory keys to match the rest of the room. ELVIS
          SCREAMS OUT the last line, "You can do anything, but
          stay off of my blue suede shoes!"

          They stand up, look around -- Arctic white is every-
          where. Dwight likes it. Toby is less sure.

                          THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                The next morning we found her, in a
                stone well on a neighboring
                property. I climbed down to her,
                but slipped and broke my leg, and
                while we waited for the rescue team
                to pull us out she died in my arms.
                If you've had a child... my whole
                everything just focused down to one
                thing, to hold her and make her
                feel safe. But no matter what I
                said to her, I couldn't stop her
                shaking, crying. Her last moments
                on this earth were filled with
                terror. Of a stone golem.

      She gives him the envelope with the certified check. He
      shakes her hand, then deftly adjusts his grip so that just
      for a moment he holds her hand as you would hold a child's.

      The clock on the wall advances from 1:30am to 5:50am, and

                    in the transmission.
          The second sailor holds aloft the banana peel sealed in a

          Chevy-Nova with its camouflage paint job.
          A THIRD SAILOR is rummaging through the boxes in the open

                    Well, I think he used that nine
                    hundred dollars to buy his Lincoln.
                    He's giving my mom a joyride in it

          finishes painting the hood with the words: PAY UP OR DIE.

          If any such be here-
          As it were sin to doubt - that love this

                         PAINTING
          Wherein you see me smeared; if any fear
          Lesser his person than an ill report;
          If any think brave death outweighs bad
          life,
          And that his country's dearer than

                         HIMSELF;
          Let him alone, or so many so minded,
          Wave thus, to express his disposition,

          AND FOLLOW MARTIUS!

							CUT TO:

	INT. MR. MARSCHAL'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING

	This brownstone has been home to the Marschal's for many, many
	years.  It's filled with a lifetime of memories.  Memories shared
	by two people.

	Two rocking chairs sit side by side near the windows that
	overlook the street...  A corner table displays fancy wooden
	chess set.  The game half-finished, frozen in a layer of dust...
	An easel stands before a piano.  The incomplete water color
	painting of a smiling elderly woman sitting on the piano bench
	sits sadly on the faded yellow paper.

	Malcolm takes in the living room silently.  He stands near the
	open door.

	Cole walks through the room.  Tiny eyes searching carefully.  He
	leans behind the sofa looking for something.  Malcolm watches
	Cole with a crinkled brow.

	Cole peeks behind the old piano crammed against the wall.

			     MR. MARSCHAL
		Maybe Jill will play for us when
		she gets back.

	Cole turns to find Mr. Marschal standing with a glass of
	lemonade.  Cole takes it from his shaking hands.

			     COLE
		Thank you.

	Mr. Marschal shuffles over to the sofa.  Takes a seat.

	Cole begins surveying the room again.  Beat.  His eyes finally
	come to rest on a plant seated in the corner.  He stares at it...
	THE LEAVES OF THE PLANT SHAKE SLIGHTLY FROM A BREEZE.

	Cole puts down his glass on a table and walks over to the plant.
	Cole kneels down and starts to push the potted plant aside.  THE
	POT SCREECHES ON THE WOODEN FLOOR.

	Malcolm calls to Cole under his breath.

		Cole, what's happening...

	Cole quickly gets up and rushes out of the tent.  His foot
	catches one of the chairs the tent is fastened to.  He stumbles
	out.  He doesn't realize one of the bedsheets comes loose.  It
	folds to the ground.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALL - NIGHT

	He doesn't stop as he moves through the shadowy hall and pushes
	open his mother's bedroom door.

							CUT TO:

	INT. LYNN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Cole stands in the doorway to his mother's bedroom.  He looks
	over the room carefully.  Everything is still.

	Lynn's room is sparse.  No paintings, no accessaries.  A bed
	without a frame sits in the corner.  A table with a sewing
	machine fills the other side of the room.

	HIS MOTHER'S VOICE turns his attention back to the bed.

			     LYNN
		Cole, what's happening to you?

	Cole looks down and finds his mother laying in her bed.  Her face
	contorted in deep sadness as she speaks in her sleep.

			     LYNN
		Is someone hurting you?...  I'll
		beat their asses.

	Cole smiles at his mother as he moves to her side.  Touches her
	face with his tiny fingers.

			     COLE
			(whispers)
		Momma, you sleep now.

	His touch seems to have an effect.  Lynn becomes still in her
	sleep.  Cole watches her carefully.

Jean exits. Bateman straightens some magazines in his 
office, lifts a painting off the wall and puts it back at a 
slightly different angle. He fiddles with some pencils in a 
beer stein. He puts on some MUSIC and flips through a 
Sports Illustrated. He buzzes Jean. She comes in a moment

The taxi bumps to a halt.

INT. ESPACE RESTAURANT- NIGHT 

A cavernous garage, harshly spot-lit, decorated in 
self-conscious brutalist chic. Iron girders, walls of waxed 
plaster featuring exposed rusted pipes, a huge Schnabel 
smashed-plate painting on one wall. The tables and chairs are 
made of extremely uncomfortable 
bolted steel.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
I'm on the verge of tears by the time we arrive at Espace 
since I'm positive we won't have a decent table, but we do, 
and relief washes over me in an awesome wave.

Tm Price and two downtown types, STASH and VANDEN, are 
already seated. Vanden is about twenty, pretty and sullen, 
with green streaks in her black hair. Stash is pale, with 
ragged black hair and bad skin.

They are all trying to read large stainless steel menus 
that look like minimalist art.

PRICE 
The menu's in braille.

He gets up to greet them, giving Evelyn a suspiciously long

A bare room, lit by one light bulb. The walls are blank

Bateman pours lime over Paul Owen's body, which is lying in 
a bathtub. He plays Huey Lewis, smokes a cigar, watches the 
body dissolve.

INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

Bateman is letting himself into the apartment. It is very 
similar to Bateman's, but even more minimalist. The walls 
are white-pigmented concrete with a large minimalist painting 
on the wall. One wall is covered in a trendy, large-scale 
scientific drawing above a long, black leather couch.

BATEMAN 
Where to send the bastard? Dallas? Pans?

He throws some clothes into a suitcase, randomly grabbing 
toiletries and shoving them in.

BATEMAN 
Singapore? London. I'll send the asshole to London.

He puts some music on to help muffle his voice, then leans 
over the answering machine.

He does a passable imitation of Owen's speech.

Hi, this is Paul. I've been called away to London

                No, this is adult. And by the way,
                you decided to be straight?
                Please. Of course you were
                programmed. By nature or nurture,
                or both.

      NATHAN stands.

                           NATHAN (CONT'D)
                To be honest, Caleb, you're kind of
                annoying me now. This is your
                insecurity talking, not your
                intellect.

      CALEB opens his mouth to reply, but NATHAN shuts him down.

                          NATHAN (CONT'D)
                Come with me.

      INT. HOUSE/POLLOCK ROOM - DAY

      NATHAN and CALEB stand in front of the Pollock drip painting.

                          NATHAN
                You know this guy, right?

          Jackson Pollock. The drip painter.
          He let his mind go blank, and his
          hand go where it wanted. Not
          deliberate, not random. Someplace
          in between. They called it
          automatic art.

NATHAN gazes at the canvas.

          Let's make this like Star Trek,
          okay? Engage intellect.

                      CALEB
          ... What?

                    NATHAN
          I'm Kirk. Your head is the warp
          drive. `Engage intellect'. What
          if Pollock had reversed the
          challenge? Instead of trying to
          make art without thinking, he said:
          I can't paint anything unless I
          know exactly why I'm doing it.
          What would have happened?

CALEB thinks.

                    CALEB
          He never would have made a single
          mark.

NATHAN clicks his fingers.

                    NATHAN
          See? There's my guy. There's my
          buddy, who actually thinks before
          he opens his mouth. He'd never
          have made a single mark. The
          challenge is not to act
          automatically. It's to find an
          action that is not automatic. From
          talking, to breathing, to painting.

NATHAN glances back at CALEB.

                    NATHAN (CONT'D)
          To fucking. Even falling in love.

A beat.

NATHAN kills his beer.

                    NATHAN (CONT'D)
          For the record, Ava is not acting
          as if she likes you.

     As NATHAN and AVA talk, NATHAN reaches out to AVA. His hand
     touches the side of her cheek. The gesture is not quite
     neutral. Feels predatory, but not unambiguously so.

     Then he tugs at the material of her shirt. Pulling up the
     sleeve from her wrist. Revealing the robot structure of her
     arm.

     AVA pulls away.       Tugs the material back down -

     - and NATHAN takes a corrective movement step to regain his
     balance. Showing that he is drunk.

     Only now -

     - CALEB turns.

     And freezes.    Seeing the television.

     On the screen, NATHAN reaches down to the table.

     He picks up the drawing AVA was working on, and he looks at
     it for a moment.

     They exchange a few words.

     Then abruptly NATHAN rips drawing in half.      Drops it on the
     floor. Then turns, and exits.

     Leaving AVA alone.

     INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT

     On CCTV, we watch CALEB walk fast down the glass corridor.

     INT. HOUSE/POLLOCK ROOM - NIGHT

     CALEB enters the Jackson Pollock room.

     Standing by the painting, he can see KYOKO.

                              CALEB
                  Kyoko.

     KYOKO turns at the sound of her name, but doesn't respond.

                            CALEB (CONT'D)
                  Kyoko - where's Nathan?

     She doesn't answer.

                            CALEB (CONT'D)
                  Jesus! You really don't speak a
                  word of English?

     CALEB walks over to her, and takes hold of her wrist.
                                                           74.

	In the books, we see pictures, lithographs, paintings and 
	drawings...

				  ANNIE (V.O.)
		"A million years before the birth of 
		man, they grazed the vast empty plains of 
		grass and crossed to other continents 
		over bridges of rocks... They first knew 
		man as the hunted knows the hunter, for 
		long before man saw horses as a means to 
		killing other beasts, man killed them for
