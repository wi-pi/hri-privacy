                Close the shutters.

      Paulo moves over to the window and starts closing the
      shutters. The sun is slowly shuttered out.

                          CARRIE (CONT'D)
                All of them.

      The room is dark except for the bright sunlight straining to
      get in between the cracks of the closed shutters. Carrie is
      asleep. Miranda sits on the bed. Carrie stirs, half waking...
      Miranda smiles.

                           MIRANDA
                Morning.

                Did I dream it?

      Miranda shakes her head, no. Carrie closes her eyes, falls
      back asleep.

      Dark. Carrie is still asleep. Charlotte sits on the bed. She
      gently shakes Carrie. Carrie opens her eyes.

                          CHARLOTTE
                Carrie, it's dinner time. You slept
                the whole day.

      A "tingling of glass" sound wakes Carrie. She opens her eyes

      breakfast tray.

                           SAMANTHA
                Honey, you have to eat a little

      Samantha holds up a bowl of yogurt. Carrie adjusts on her
      pillows a little. Samantha feeds Carrie a spoonful of yogurt.

      All four girls are laying in the sun in bathing suits reading

      beach chair.

                The sun feels nice.

                Jesus, honey. Wax much?

      Miranda looks up at Samantha. Samantha indicates her swimsuit
      crotch area...which is badly in need of a wax. Miranda grabs
      her towel and covers her crotch area.

                          MIRANDA
                -- What? I didn't know I was going

      A romantic open-air restaurant on the beach. A MARIACHI BAND
      is serenading HONEYMOON COUPLES. A MALE HOST leads the girls
      across the small dance floor to their table. As they walk
      Miranda notices a slow dancing TWENTY-SOMETHING HONEYMOON
      COUPLE kissing -- very much in love.

                 Thank god for that Mariachi band or
                 I'd be able to hear my own

                 After everything I know... After
                 twenty years of everything we've
                 learned -- I threw it all away for
                 the thrill of putting his name on
                 the honeymoon suite.
                     (beat)

                 No-- I think we're on their

       She points to the TWENTY-SOMETHING COUPLE at a nearby table--
       who have progressed to graphic French kissing.

                 He couldn't get out of the car.
                 After everything he'd already put
                 me through -- he couldn't make the
                 effort and get out of the car? I
                 made the effort -- I put a bird on
                 my head.

                Rosenfeld? You know what he's gonna
                do? He's gonna bring the Sheik to
                Atlantic City, where we can rebuild
                all those resorts there, put
                everybody back to work.

             mother, then by Costa. For the

             life, and since we found the
             apartment, he can't be Edwards.
             To be seen, to be recognized, is a
             horrifying thing to Asher. He has
             no identity and wants it that way.

             hundred dollars at a 'no questions
             asked' facelift clinic in
