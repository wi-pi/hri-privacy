            What kind of chromium is it?

                               ERIN
            There's more than one kind?

                               FRANKEL
            Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does
            all kinds of good things for the body.
            There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and
            then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium,
            which, depending on the amounts, can be very
            harmful.

                               ERIN
            Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?

                               FRANKEL
            With repeated exposure to toxic levels --
            God, anything, really -- respiratory
            disease, liver failure, heart failure,
            reproductive failure, chronic headaches,
            bone or organ deterioration -- plus, of
            course, any type of cancer.

     He rattles it off coolly.  Just facts.  Erin's stunned.

                               ERIN
            So that stuff -- it kills people.

                               FRANKEL
            Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly
            carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.

                               ERIN
            Well, how do I find out what kind of
            chromium is up in Hinkley?

                               FRANKEL
            Have you been to the water board?

                Yeah. Just. Like. Need some fresh
                air, somethin' --

      PANIC flashes in his eyes as he moves toward the door,
      suddenly CRUMPLES TO THE FLOOR, out cold --

                          TOMICA
                Eric!

      They all hurry over to him --

128   EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET - DAY                               128

      An AMBULANCE blares through the night, running red lights,
      hurtling toward the hulking edifice of CEDARS SINAI --

129   INT. CEDARS - EAZY'S ROOM - DAY                             129

      Eazy lies in a propped-up hospital bed, watching TV. He
      doesn't look ill, just annoyed with the situation. Tomica
      sits in a chair beside him, flipping through a magazine.

      A young DOCTOR walks in, carrying a chart. He looks troubled,
      preoccupied. His eyes dart from Tomica... to Eazy.

                          TOMICA
                You gonna say something? Is it a
                respiratory infection -- pneumonia?
                                                       133.


                    DOCTOR
          Yes, well, it is those things...
          and more, I'm afraid... We ran a
          full blood battery and -- (beat)
          Mr. Wright, I'm sorry but you've
          tested positive for the HIV virus.

Tomica reflexively stands, her hand over her mouth. Eazy
squints, smiles, looks at the Doctor like he's crazy.

                    EAZY
          Get the fuck outta here.

                    DOCTOR
          The normal T-cell count is anywhere
          between 500 and 1500. Right now,
          your T-cell count is... 14.

Tomica just stands there, mouth agape, speechless. Eazy's
smile slowly fades to a look of pure dread.

That's so impressive!
