          EXT. PAXTON SEAFOODS PIER - DAY

          Richard docks the boat at the Paxton Seafood pier.   Located in
          the town's harbor, the packing plant consists of three large
          warehouses, and buzzes with activity.   Fishing boats line the
          pier, unload their fish, and forklifts take the fish to be
          processed.   Everything is clean and organized.
          Richard and Margaret walk down the pier.   He points to the SEALS
          that swim everywhere and eat fish scraps.   Damn, they're cute.
          Richard waves hello to WORKERS.   An elderly Phillipino man, BEK
          BEK, yells at them as he walks into a warehouse.

          BEK BEK
          Hey, Richard!   That the lucky lady?

          RICHARD
          Yes sir, it is!

          BEK BEK
          (to Margaret)

          MARGARET
          That's great to hear.

The Riepers' house is clean and tidy. They are a low middle-class family on a modest income.

HONORA 
Oh! . . . Mackerel. We'll have them for lunch tomorrow.

Herbert comes up behind Honora, gives her a peck on cheek and puts his hand on her bum.

HERBERT 
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?

HONORA 
playfully shoves his hand away.

HONORA 
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.

HERBERT 
sighs as HONORA puts the frying pan on the stove.

young student boarder, STEVE BAYLISS, appears in doorway, nervously clutching a record.

STEVE 
Excuse me . . . would you mind if I put my long-playing record on?

HERBERT 
You're partial to a nice bit of mackerel, aren't you, STEVE?

STEVE 
 Well . . . actually, I'm not much of a fish man, Mr. Rieper.

The Rat and Stacy are escorted by the host to a

	I think I'll have the Seafood Salad

	Excellent.

The Rat leans back in the booth. He is starting to
feel in control now. Then something hits him. The
panic sweeps across his face.

Slowly, The Rat reaches back to check his wallet.
It's gone.

minute. He excuses himself and walks over to the

                         I wasn't.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I've been asked out on dates before, 
                         and that's what it sounded like.

                                     JO
                         Do you like seafood? I know a good 
                         seafood place.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. A SEAFOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               On the Virginia side of the Potomac. KAFFEE and JO are sitting 
               at a table, finishing up dinner.

                                     JO
                         My third case was a Drunk and 
                         Disorderly. The trial lasted nine 
                         weeks. I rounded up 31 people who 
                         were in the bar that night.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Nine weeks on a D and D? What was 
                         the prosecutor offering?

                                     JO
                         15 days.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (pause)
                         Well, you sure hustled the shit outta 
                         him.

                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
            Not my jurisdiction.  The city
            limits are two point two miles
            beyond the rest area.  Can you make
            it that far?

                         DUKE
            I'll try.  I've been wanting to go
            to Baker for a long time.  I've
            heard a lot about it.

The PATROLMAN holds the door for DUKE who gets in.

                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
            Excellent seafood.  With a mind
            like yours, you'll probably want to
            try the land-crab.  Try the Majestic
            Diner.

The PATROLMAN slams the door shut.

EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY

DUKE drives away -- teeth gritted.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            I felt raped.  The Pig had done me
            on all fronts, and now he was going
            off to chuckle about it -- on the
            west side of town, waiting for me
            to make a run for L.A.

DUKE drives past the rest area to an intersection where he
signals to turn right into Baker.  As he approaches the turn
he sees the HITCHHIKER!  As DUKE slows to make the turn
their eyes meet.  DUKE is about to wave -- but the HITCHHIKER
drops his thumb.

                         DUKE
            Great Jesus, it's him.

DUKE, spooked, SPINS THE RED SHARK round -- ROARS BACK THE
WAY HE CAME.

            I gave the cabbie an extra ten
            bucks to make sure she gets there
            safe.  Also, I told him I'd be
            there myself in an hour, and if she
            wasn't, I'd come back out here and
            rip his lungs out.

                         DUKE
            That's good.  You can't be subtle
            in this town.

                         GONZO
            As your attorney, I advise you to
            tell me where you put the goddamn
            mescaline.

                         DUKE
            Maybe we should take it easy tonight.

                         GONZO
            Right.  Let's find a good seafood
            restaurant and eat some red salmon.
            I feel a powerful lust for red
            salmon...

The electric WHITE WHALE heads off down the Strip.  The
sun's going down behind the scrub hills, a good Kristofferson
tune croaks on the radio in the warm dusk.

INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - BATHROOM - NEXT MORNING

GONZO throws up in the toilet bowl.

In the background, DUKE opens curtains.  Daylight blinds him.

                         DUKE
            Come on, we're going to be late.

GONZO looks up at his sick reflection -- wipes his mouth
with a towel.

                         GONZO
            This goddamn mescaline.  Why the
            fuck can't they make it a little
            less pure?  Maybe mix it up with
            Rolaids or something.

                  Okay, well let me run in here. I'll
                  see you later tonight.

                              OSCAR
                  Love you.

                            WANDA
                  Love you too.

        Wanda hangs up the phone. She looks at it for a beat. Then
        puts it back in her purse and heads into the warehouse.


A11     EXT. FARMER JOE'S PARKING LOT- DAY- MOMENTS LATER         A11

        We see the entrance of Farmer Joe's, and shoppers coming in
        and out. Oscar looks around for a beat, and takes off his
        hoody, and puts it into his back pocket. We follow him into-


11      INT. FARMER JOE'S- DAY- MOMENTS LATER                        11

        It is a moderately sized grocery store, but several SHOPPERS
        move about the aisles. Oscar walks over to the seafood
        section where Cato CALDWELL, a 22 year old charismatic Black       
        male stands behind the counter wearing a Deli apron.

        Cato sees Oscar and smiles brightly. He takes a pile of fish       
        off the scale, bags it, ands it to an older BLACK WOMAN. He
        takes off his clear glove and slaps hands with Oscar over the
        counter.

                            CATO                                           
                  Sup Osc, bruh?

                            OSCAR
                  Shit. What's good?

                            CATO                                           
                  You lookin for Emi?

                            OSCAR
                  Yeah. He here today?

                           KATIE (CONT'D)
                 I'm not sure what type of fish he
                 wants. And most of these recipes
                 are different on this site.

       Oscar watches her with a look of pity. Suddenly, an idea
       flashes before his eyes.

       He pulls out his cellphone, quickly dials a number, and holds
       it to his ear.


12     INT. GRANDMA BONNIE'S HOUSE- KITCHEN- CONTINUOUS             12

       We see GRANDMA BONNIE, a black woman in her early 70's ,
       putting flowers into a vase on her kitchen counter.

       A cordless phone RINGS on the counter. She looks at the phone
       for a beat then she cheers up.
