                       Good evening. We're here today                       
                       with Ronnie Barnhardt, head of

                       Well, being a mall security guard
                       basically requires the same skill
                       set that someone in say the FBI
                       has. You have to use logic and
                       evidence and old-fashioned common
                       sense as well as the latest
                       technology to deduce the criminal
                       mind. It's what I do.
          
          All of a sudden, STEVIE AND THE SKATERS come up behind            
          Ronnie. They look into the camera lens and start                  
          smiling. Ronnie turns around and sees them, but tries to          
          focus on the reporter.

                         Hi, there, I'm new in town. Can you 
                         direct me to Carnegie Hall, or should 
                         I just go fuck myself --

John looks down at Ripely.
A KEYPAD is mounted at the head of the tube.
A red button:  "EMERG-OPEN"
That's plain enough.

		All right --

He presses it.
The Tube opens with a loud BLAST of compressed air.
The Monks at the door recoil at the sound.

			ABBOT
		When we left Earth seventy years ago, it
		was on the brink of a New Dark Age.
		Technology was on the verge of destroying
		the planet's environment.  A computer virus
		was threatening to wipe away all recorded
		knowledge.  There didn't seem to be any
		way it could be averted.  In the almost
		forty years since we were towed out here
		in hypersleep, the news that came with 
		occasional supply ships only got worse.
		Finally, the ships stopped coming.  We 
		had to resign ourselves to the fact that
		worst had come to pass, and the Earth
		no longer existed.

Now she gives him that look.

		    (slowly)
		Uh...All right... Forget the Earth - How

A new look overtakes the Abbot's face.  A look of fear.  
Now she's getting to him - or is she?
He abruptly stands.

		Your mind is troubled.  You need to rest

IN THE TRIBUNAL ROOM - NIGHT

As he continues we move down a row of stern Monk faces, ending

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

A large circular room with wooden walls stretching thirty feet
high.  Light creeps in through stained glass windows.

Hundreds of monks sits in a gallery that looms over
the floor of the Tribunal.  On the floor:

The Abbot and the five eldest Monks sit at a long table facing
the witness stand.  On the stand:

RIPLEY

Considers the faces that surround her.  Fear.  Hate.

Ripley turns to the Abbot.

			RIPLEY
		Yes, the ship brought it.  Not evil. It
		brought the Alien.  I told you, it's here.

			ABBOT
		We know the name of the evil it brought.
		It brought technology.  Technology to

		Destruction!

		I was on the Earth less than a year ago.
		It's still there.  People, cities, all

A murmur through the crowd.  Some are listening to her.
The Abbot looks around.  He must be in command.

		    (matter of fact)

			RIPLEY
		You left that part out.

			JOHN
		The order was more of a counter culture,
		a reaction to the Technology that was
		beginning to take over everyone's lives.
		It was a simple enough idea - Read, don't 
		watch disk.  Walk, don't pump more carbons
		into the air.  The earliest members
		renounced technology.  Started to collect
		the remaining books.  Nobody would have
		noticed if it hadn't been for the Virus.

		Your Abbot talked about that.  The
		New Plague.

		A computer virus.  A bad program.  By

		After a scare like that, thousands flocked

		for written information.  For our books.
		They abandoned the modern ways --

		I think I can see how this comes out.

Warped by years of water dripping from above.

held high...

Rusted.  Open.  And all around them.

She touches the cool, familiar material.  Smiles.
Now she knows this is not a dream.
She turns and SPRINGS the trap in front of her --
SNAP!!


THE FOUR

Slowly make their way down the corridor, one hand holding a
candle high, the other poking a piece of wood into the trap in
front of them... SNAP-SNAP...SNAP. SNAP.
walking carefully around the yet unfired traps....


THE DOOR TO THE TECHNOLOGY ROOM

A huge wooden door with no knob or handle.  Looks like it could
almost be part of the wall.  John and Ripley are the first to
it.  They put down their planks and begin to feel around the
edges of the door for some purchase.
The Abbot joins them.


BACK IN THE CORRIDOR

Anthony lags behind.  He senses a presence in the hallway.
Hears a sound behind him.
We see a GLIMPSE of something --
He turns towards the sound --

Empty hallway.

He thinks.  Starts forward again -- with his ear cocked to the
rear... SNAP!


AT THE DOOR

Ripley, John and The Abbot knock on the door, walls.
Ripley leans her head against the wall in frustration and
exhaustion.  To get this far, and be locked out.
She feels sick to her stomach.
How long since she had food?
She looks over at John.
He is staring at her.
He turns red at being caught.  Cute.

		I just - are you allright?

		Tied.  Without sleep, food -- I just
		feel my age.
		       (smiles)
		Figuring hyperspace time, I'm almost a

The wall beneath his fist sounds hollow.
Fingernails find the edge of the plank and pull --
The plank slides aside on tiny, rusty pneumatic pistons.

A primitive KEYBOARD.  Circa late twentieth century.

The Door starts to slide down --

The Alien is feet away --
INCHES...

The door seats itself closed with a solid THUD.

Ripley, panting, rests eyes closed against the rough wooden
door.  A beat.
She turns to the room for the first time and finds --


WINDMILLS

Real Man of LaMancha wood and cloth windmills.  Two story high
arms slowly rotating.  Moving enormous volumes of air through
the wind tunnel-like room.  As far as the eye can see.
Turning, creaking.
WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
But no electronics.  No radio.  No weapons.
This is the Technology Room.

Ripley collapses to the floor and loses consciousness.  

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SULACO ESCAPE SHIP #4 (DREAM)

Yellow warning lights PULSE.  Those goddamned STROBES are
flickering on and off.  Steam blasts out overhead pipes.

The blue-spark pilot light muzzles of a FLAME THROWER shyly
pokes out from behind a console.  It's owner cautiously
follows...


RIPLEY

She's breathing heavy.
She's wearing a sweat soaked tank top.
Her eyes flit from side to side.  Then up.  Then down.
She pokes the weapon out ahead of her and moves into the pod.
She silently crosses the distance to Newt's sleep tube:


IN THE TUBE

Newt sleeps peacefully.
Ripley allows herself one maternal smile, then remembers.
Her grip TIGHTENS in the Flame Thrower in her hands.
She flips a switch to HI HEAT.
Moves around the sleep tubes...

A noise to her left.
She WHIRLS --

Pulls the trigger on the flame thrower -- click.  Nothing.
She tries again -- a half-hearted burp, but no flame.
She begins to panic --

Senses the Alien's presence.
Looks left, right, up - no Alien...
Looks down:

The Alien's tail is COMING UP BETWEEN HER LEGS.
She turns --

Right into it's grasp.
The useless flamethrower SKITTERS across the floor.
She PUMMELS the beast with balled up fists.

			ANTHONY
		More than that.  There are pumps beneath

								CUT TO:

INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM

John stands by a ladder that runs up to a trap door in the 
ceiling.  Holds a torch.
Ripley is on the ground with Anthony, his injured leg splayed 
out in front of him.  Skin is palid.

			ANTHONY
		Don't have second thoughts.  Blind and
		crippled I would only slow you down.
		Give him time to figure out what you're
		doing.  Just leave me my staff.

			RIPLEY
		Okay.  Good luck.

She shakes his hand.  He pulls her closer.
Anthony's empty eye sockets seem to see as he looks at Ripley.

			ANTHONY
		Ripley, I know.  Good luck.

			RIPLEY
		Sit tight.

Ripley crosses to John.  Poised at the bottom of the ladder they
look up at the trap door on the ceiling.

Lit from within by daylight beaming down from above -- pours
into the sea a short distance from them.

		Opens to the surface.  Water flows in
		and out.  I don't know how.  There's one

		What do we do?

John points to three small leather and wood coracles bobbing at
the end of their ropes.

			JOHN
		We cross.


INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM - DAY

Anthony has dragged himself to a sitting position against the
bottom of one of the windmills.  He winces as he prods his
tender ankle with the end of his staff.  It SPARKS.
The large canvas arms of the windmill rotate above his head.
The wind blows through his hair.
WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
Feels good.

Anthony reaches up and waves his hand of his "eyes."

			ANTHONY
		Now the seer can only see what God wants
		him to.  Forty years on a planet of Monks
		and I've finally found religion.

A floor board CREAKS.
Anthony strains to hear:

			ANTHONY
		John?  Ripley?

WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
He knows it is not.

As Ripley takes the torch away from the water, tiny ripples move
across the surface.
She doesn't notice.


A SHAPE

Passes underneath the boat.  A swimming CREATURE.  The Alien.
Thanks to the reflective qualities of water, it appears HUGE.
Dwarfs their coracle.


INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM - NIGHT

All the windmills are BURNING.
Flaming arms lazily turning.
Anthony is not in sight.
Whoosh...Whoosh...


THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OCEAN - NIGHT

Another dock with ladders going up and down.
Ripley and John climb out of the coracle.
Don't waste time tying off.  They go  --


UP THE LADDER

A hundred foot climb.  The wood is twisted.
Rungs have been torn away in some places.
They pull themselves up sections that have only the tiniest
foothold.  The temperature rises as they do.
Sweat runs into their eyes.

Soon they can see the floor above them:
BLACKENED by intense heat.
They climb.


INT. UNDERGROUND WHEAT FIELDS - NIGHT

Ripley and John come up from the level below.

			RIPLEY
		Holy shit.

John crosses himself.

Another testament to the terrible battle with the Alien.
Reduced to just a huge, blackened floor.
All the crops burned to ash --
Their charred stalks mingled with the corpses of roasted Monks.
Their nostrils assailed by the stench of the dead --
Ripley would puke if she had any food in her body.

She looks at him. He meets her gaze. A beat.

guess that's your call.

DIAMOND

What sort of father would you make? You told me once the only thing that
matters is knowledge. That's wrong. Science and technology can only take
you so far - in the end it's our humanity that maners. That's what makes us
great. You're a wonderful scientist, Will -but what sort of person are you?
What would you do if it was your child?

She looks straight into his eyes. Finally he answers. Softly -

WILL

I don't know how to do it - not the humanity part, that's easy compared to
getting into the city. I just don't know...

Down here - it's called Funeral Rock. It sits at the bottom of the temple.
From there you can make your way into the city. Even so, you still have to
cross the river.

                         the intelligence workload. You're

                         question as I see it isn't "why should 
                         you work for N.S.A." it's "why

INT.  HESS FAMILY ROOM - DAY

Morgan and Bo and Merrill are seated together on the sofa. 
All three are wearing foil helmets.  Beat.

Graham stares at his family huddled on the couch.  Beat. 
Graham takes in the news as he moves to the stairs.  He takes
a seat on the second to last step.

He sits obscured by the balusters.  Beat.

                    GRAHAM
          Tell me something Morgan.  In that
          book of your, did they happen to
          detail what would happen if they
          were hostile?

                    MORGAN
          Yes.  They would invade us using
          only ground tactics.  Hand to hand
          combat.  They wouldn't use their
          technology or fight an airborne
          battle, because they would know we
          would eventually use nuclear
          weapons and the planet would be
          useless to them.

          I'm sorry, what book is this?

          Did they say what our chances would
          be if they did invade?

                    MORGAN
          They said one of two things could
          happen.  One, they fight and are
          defeated and leave to return again
          with full forces hundreds or even
          thousands of years later.

          Through the street darts Mary, eyes berserk in search for herher
          son. She looks at her watch. And up... up ahead, by steps
          apartment - Aaron, levitating in air.
          Hancock explains this defiance of gravity. He gently lowers
          Aaron on the sidewalk, before his mother.
          She beckons him. Like a shield, she envelops him with her arms.
          She stares up at Hancock - her eyes, stricken with fear. Or
          possibly, they were awestruck.

She turns to see Dushan scribbling again.

                     SOFYA
          STOP IT!   STOP WRITING NOW!

Valentin glances at Sasha, uncomfortable at these
outbursts. A long pause. Dushan tries to relieve the
tension.

                    DUSHAN
          In defense of my gift, let me
          demonstrate. It's quite
          remarkable, really.

He gets up, places a record on the gramophone, needle on
the record. What comes forth is not music, but Tolstoy's
voice.

It is a recording of a recent speech against capital
punishment. His voice booms, tinny and distorted. Dushan
walks to the machine, stares at it in awe. Valentin is
completely caught up in the technology.

                    VALENTIN
          It's your voice. It's wonderful.

They all listen for a moment, look to Tolstoy for a
response.

                    TOLSTOY
          It's tiresome. Another
          remarkable invention will
          supercede it.

Valentin blushes and looks at the table. Dushan tries to
hide his disappointment.

                    TOLSTOY
          Please excuse me.

Tolstoy rises, leaves the table, walks out onto the lawn.
Dushan gets up quickly, bumping the table as he goes. Tea
spills. Valentin moves to wipe it up, sneezes, a barrage of
irritable blessings.

                    DUSHAN
          Leo Nikolayevich is something of
          a Luddite, I fear.

Sofya crosses to the machine, removes the record from the
gramophone, replaces it with another Dushan has brought.

Suddenly, the air is filled with   the final duet from
Mozart's Il Nozze di Figaro. She   returns to her place.
There is a long moment where all   take in the sublimity of
it. Tolstoy walks slowly back to   the table. He stands
completely still. Tears fill his   eyes and roll down his
cheeks.

          MARY SUE (CONT'D)
          He was working on a book that showed how
          the Russians used narcosynthesis and
          physical torture and how it worked as it
          did. That was interrupted.
          He had a technology oh psychological
          warfare to present to the Defense
          Department. All that was interrupted,
          lost. Each time he sits to write, a new
          attack is launched against him and he
          spends too much time on defending
          himself. I tell him to ignore it, but
          he's so sensitive...

                         FREDDIE
          Who's attacking him?

                         MARY SUE
          People that are scared. People that are
          greedy. Ex-wives...That's what's so nice
          about being at sea. He gets his studies
          done, advances the learning, and he
          writes BOOK II.

                         FREDDIE
          What's a time-hole?
