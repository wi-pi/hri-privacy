He's a wide, thick, coarse-featured big man. Sicilian
from Sunnyside, he's spent 15 years in Attica, Joliet and
Marion penitentiaries. He's strictly a "cowboy": his
natural inclination towards a score is "...get the guns
and let's go." He's been off smack and everything else
for five years. He's clean and sober. He's the nicest
guy on the block and a loving father. If you get in his
way, he'll kill you as soon as look at you. If you asked
him about the contradictions, he wouldn't know what you
were talking about.

Michael stands quietly in the room.  This was once his
father's study, although it is totally redecorated.
Pentangeli starts sweating, and moves toward the young Don,
and kisses his hand.

				PENTANGELI
		Don Corleone, I wish you let me
		know you was coming.  We could have
		prepared something for you.

				MICHAEL
		I didn't want you to know I was
		coming.  You heard what happened in
		my home?

				PENTANGELI
		Michael, yes, we was all relieved...

				MICHAEL
			(furious)
		In my home!  In the same room where
		my wife was sleeping; where my
		children come in their pajamas, and
		play with their toys.

He's terrified Pentangeli with his anger; then, just as
suddenly, he talks quietly, calmly.

				MICHAEL
		I want you to help me take my
		revenge.

				PENTANGELI
		Michael, anything.  What is it I
		can do for you?

				MICHAEL
		I want you to settle these troubles
		with the Rosato Brothers.

				PENTANGELI
		I was just going to contact you,
		Michael; we just had a 'sit-down' -
		in fact, I just come from there.

          EXT. CORIOLES-STREET - NIGHT

          Aufidius and some of his Volscian soldiers, bloody and
          filthy, are on foot.
          They are moving through the outskirts of Corioles, leaving
          the city. Exhausted after the long and failed battle.
          Fires burn from blasted shops and homes. The Romans have
          clearly laid waste to this part of the city.
          There is a minivan stopped ahead of them. Bullets holes
          everywhere. Bodies inside.
          They walk to it. Aufidius looks in. A dead family. Father,
          mother, kids in the back. Bloody toys on the floor of the
          minivan.
          Roman atrocities.
          Aufidius gazes at the bodies. His face hardens.
          He whispers to himself:

                         AUFIDIUS
          Five times, Martius,

          They watch the Frazier-Foreman fight from Jamaica amid the
          wonderful chaos generated by kids and their toys, who crawl
          all over Ali as if he were furniture. Frazier and Foreman
          are in the center of the ring... We SEE Don King in
          Frazier's corner.

          Meanwhile, Frazier bobs and weaves, ducks and moves like he
          did with Ali. Joe throws a left hook, leaning forward with
          it. Before it lands, Foreman unleashes a hard right that
          jolts Frazier SIDEWAYS. Frazier throws another hook that
          misses. Foreman hits him with a combination of right and
          three lefts...two hooks and an uppercut that LIFTS FRAZIER
          OFF THE GROUND. Ali leans in to SEE...

            The Magnum, you know, that's only

            the wall. The movies have driven up
            the price of the Magnum anyway.
            Everybody wants them now. But the
            Wesson .38 - only $250 - and worth
            every dime of it.

            That's the Colt .25 - a fine little
            gun. Don't do a lot of damage, but
            it's as fast as the Devil. Handy
            little gun, you can carry it almost

One-year-old BUNNY is SCREAMING in a rickety crib festooned with

lift her...

cheerful airplane noises, as he DIVES and SWOOPS the shrieking kid,
until he...

in the screaming, and flops her down on the diaper table. She is
screaming LOUDER. He is fumbling with the diaper, the Baby Wipes,
getting a wad of ten or so at once. When...

dangling from the tape stuck to her skin, and SNATCHES up the
phone, hoping with everything in him that it's...

     EXT.  THE HOT HOUSE MASSAGE PARLOR -- AFTERNOON

     It's a madhouse outside The Hot House.  Police action in
     progress.  Cops have formed a barrier, holding off a crowd and
     creating an aisle to the back of a jail-van.  Cops and
     detectives escort various men, women and transvestites into the
     large vehicle.  The crowd, consisting of the dregs of society,
     is angry.  Some spit and throw trash at the cops.

     INT.  THE HOT HOUSE, RECEPTION AREA -- AFTERNOON

     An ANGRY COP pounds his nightstick on a glass cage.  Inside the
     cage sits an oily FAT MAN in front of a wall of sex toys.

                                 FAT MAN
                   Just wait!

                                 FAT MAN
                   Just wait!  I'll come out, just wait!

     INT.  THE HOT HOUSE, CORRIDORS -- AFTERNOON

     All the lights and walls are red.  Mills and Somerset follow a
     COP through the twisting corridors.  ROCK MUSIC THROBS.  They
     reach a door.

               ANGLE ON LENNY

               Now 20, making a model airplane. He's still overweight and 
               looks like his mother dresses him.

               PULL BACK TO REVEAL

               The room is filled with model airplanes. Hundreds of them.

               A KNOCK on Lenny's bedroom door. Mrs. Kagan, grayer, fatter, 
               opens the door and escorts Evan inside. She glares at Evan 
               while pretending to be cheerful.

                                     MRS. KAGAN
                         I've got a surprise for you, Lenny. 
                         You'll never guess who's here.

               Lenny looks up to see Evan, his jaw drops.

               ANGLE ON EVAN

               Looking around, shocked to see:

               PAN ALL THE WAY AROUND THE ROOM.

               Nothing has changed in the past seven years. 

               The same kids' toys, posters and comic books.

               AS WE PAN ALL THE WAY AROUND TO LENNY

               We see he's working on the model again, in his own world. 
               The window of opportunity for conversation has closed.

                                     EVAN
                         Hey, uh, it's me. Evan.

               Silence. Lenny frowns.

                                     EVAN
                         What's that you're working on? A 
                         model?

               Nothing.

                         Well, you look busy, so maybe I should 
                         make this quick. I'd totally 
                         understand if you didn't want to get 
                         into this right now, but that day at 
                         the junkyard, could you help me 
                         remember what happened? Any details?

               No response. Evan picks up a model airplane from the desk.

                         we'll see.

               Evan watches Lenny eagerly as he dumps tons of Evan's junk

               fall on the floor.

          Slim goes into slow motion. How oddly her arm moves downward.
          She looks at the phone. Blinks. Presses OFF.
          Scans the room as if she's never seen it before.
          One of Gracie's toys lies on the floor. Slim stares at it.
          Reaches down to pick it up, but instead of the toy moving up,

          Walter and Odessa are back in Battery Park. The piano is
          still across the street dangling from a winch 15 stories up.
          Walter has just written (yet) another check to the mover.

          unwrap them. Inside are two toys: A Stretch Armstrong and,

          filings are moved about with a magnetic wand to add features
          to a cartoon face.

     In a secluded corner of the library the SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD
     TRUMAN sits at a table surrounded by a stack of glossy women's
     magazines.  By tearing out individual facial features - eyes.
     nose, mouth, ears, chin, hair - from photographs of YOUNG WOMEN
     in the magazine's advertisements, Truman has been able to
     improvise a composite picture of Sylvia.

     The montage is a passable likeness although Truman is not
     completely satisfied with Sylvia's nose.  He toys with
     several nose examples before reluctantly settling for one.
     He stares wistfully at the completed picture.

He walks into a bare living room -- no chairs, tables,
lamps, nothing on the walls. He walks into a spotless,
never-used kitchen and flips on the light, opens a
drawer.

In the drawer is a collection of kids' toys, some found,
some purchased, mostly plastic figures. The action of
opening the door has started some battery-operated
animals moving around in there. Now from his pocket he
takes the plastic superhero he just found and drops it in
and closes the drawer.

He walks back into the living room. He sits on the
floor, leans back against the wall, his clothes still
soaked from the rain. He stares at his thoughts, looking
a bit numb -- and lost.

We START in the kitchen, staring at the drawer that is
now so loaded with toys, it won't shut. Some brightly-
painted soldiers are sticking out of the drawer.

In the living room there are two chairs now, and more
lamps and tables. Our PAN REVEALS that the dog from the
alley is sitting in the living room, watching Catch --
whom we now see is hanging a picture on the wall -- a
mountain scene. He holds the picture in one place, then
moves it to another, wondering. His fight with Sharon
still colors his mood, but he's working through it.

angry, his nose bandaged, eyes blackened a bit from the
blow.

Catch kneels in the sand, beside the boy, and he spills

           Yeah. I've... kind of been saving
           them up.

                         CANDACE
           For Tommy?

He nods. She kneels close to her boy, the toys, pleased
but not quite knowing what to say.

                         CANDACE
           Well, thank you. Thanks a lot.

Catch nods, grins at Tommy who is already at play with
the figures.


ANGLE - SHARON

She has entered the park and witnessed this from a
distance. She is angling toward the playground.


ON CATCH

He watches Tommy at play with the figures, but it's
almost too much for him. He touches the boy and rises,
smiles and nods at Candace and begins to walk off.

     It's beautiful here, striking and sad.  Now on foot,
     Castor follows Eve up a bluff, through a phalanx of 
     graves -- with no idea where she's leading him.

     Finally she stops at a crucifix-topped headstone.  Castor
     joins her and reads the etched marble stone:

cots. They must be no more than two or three years old but their faces end
bodies are those of old, old apeswizened and wrinkled, frail with age.

A double set of bars provide a sort of air-lock. Hanging on them is a sign

"Quarantine. No Entry".

Drak and the Council of Elders stare in at the children. Doctor Zora is
with them - she's nervous, twisting her fingers.

plastic garbage bags with mementos of his relationship with
Clementine.  There are funny little gifts, wind-up toys, some
potatoes dressed as women, some clothing Clementine has left
there, some CD's.  He pulls a big clump of pages out of his
loose-leaf journal and dumps them in the bag.

He gets some clean loose-leaf paper and writes:

	I can't believe I'm crying already.  He
	says, "It takes a long time.  That's why
	it doesn't often happen to people who
	break easily or have sharp edges, or who
	have to be carefully kept.  Generally by
	the time you are Real, most of your hair
	has been loved off, and your eyes drop
	out and you get loose in the joints and
	very shabby.  But these things don't
	matter at all, because once you are Real
	you can't be ugly, except to people who

She's weeping.  Joel is stroking her hair.  They kiss and
begin to make love under the blanket.  It's sweet and gentle
and then it starts to fade.

	No!  Jesus, No!

He looks down and Clementine's tear-streaked face is fading.
She continues as if she's still being made love to, even
though Joel is completely beside himself.  He jumps up naked
and yells at the ceiling.

	Please!  Please!  I've changed my mind!

               Room's not stinky.   Only when you
               do a fart.

     Ma sit's down. She doesn't look at Jack.

                          MA
               OK.

                         JACK
               I don't believe in your stinky

                   (bitter, still not looking
                    at him)
               Fine. That's fine Jack.

     Another long miserable pause. Jack, angry and upset, watches
     her for a while then sits down on the floor and takes out his
     toys from under the TV. He plays quietly.

     Ma looks up at the skylight. As she watches a gust of wind
     blow the leaf away.
     LATER - dusk

     Ma and Jack are in bed, under the duvet in their clothes,
     shuddering with cold. Jack tries the lamp. Nothing. He fixes
     the dents in the shade then lies back down. A terrible
     flatness in the air. Ma is turned away from Jack. She has
     been crying.
