                         Hey. I have some stretcher bars out 
                         in the car. Can somebody help me 
                         bring them in?

                                     BART
                         Of course we'll drop what we're doing 
                         because what you're doing must be 
                         more important.

               Bart doesn't look up. He grabs another book.

                                     KELLY
                         Sure. I mean, I'll help.

               Bart raises his eyebrow. Kelly shrugs off the look.

                                     BART
                         I'll find those reports.

               INT. TABBY'S STUDIO - NIGHT

               Tabby drops the canvas and points at the table. Kelly dumps 
               the bars and stands there looking around.

               At the wood floors and skylights. Couch covered with a sheet.

               Painting, serious ones, with layers of paint and mysterious 
               objects stuck to them lay against the walls. They all seem 
               faded, like a vacation photo that's been through the wash.

               Kelly moves to the PAINTING on the easel.

               Very yellow and pink. Kind of looks like castles.

                                     KELLY
                         Gold. The color of the sun.

               Tabby wrestles with the bolt of canvas.

                         As the viewer, I get to decide what 
                         it is, I'm afraid. And it doesn't 
                         look a thing like it.

          He reaches into a pocket. Pulls out a folded sheet of paper.
          It opens to reveal a MAP of the Pacific. A dot is CIRCLED in

                    This is Howland Island. It's half-
                    way between Honolulu and New
                    Guinea. It has no elevation, no
                    trees, it's a mile wide and a mile
                    and a half long. Hardly anyone
                    knows or cares that it exists.

                    building the runways yet. Maybe
                    if someone I knew could get the
                    President's attention...
          She stares at the map.   The dot.

          Her eyes are clicking through a calculus of their own.

          Curtis rises through the storm shelter's entryway. Out of
          the corner of his eye he catches,

          A MAN PASSING BY.
          Curtis is startled. He turns to see a CREW of MEN from the
          power company hoisting a ladder onto the pole at the corner
          of the house. A power line dangles overhead.
          He turns to see NEIGHBORS in their yards clearing debris.
          Leaves and branches clutter the ground. The aftermath of a
          storm.
          Samantha steps out of the shelter holding Hannah. She
          surveys the damage.

                          CURTIS
           It's fine.
          She walks over to Curtis and hugs him. He kisses Samantha on

           Do you have any vacation time that

           Well, I know that times are hard,

           for you to separate yourself from
           that storm shelter.

                A year and a half into Chris'
                disappearance, each day that goes by now
                feels like two. Dad calls it "suspended
                animation." I kept telling myself that
                he had to get lost to prove his
                independence to himself. But this was no
                day run for the Road Warriors and after
                so much time, I could no longer keep out
                the haunting thoughts.

      Chris, with pack and new hat walks away from camera
      toward the interstate and the brittle mountains beyond.

                             CARINE (V.O.)
                In many ways, my life and even my parents
                had begun to move in new directions. I'd
                fallen in love. And mom and dad had even
                ventured out on a brief vacation. But,
                when a search of tax records uncovered
                Chris' contribution to OXFAM, the weight
                of his disappearance just seemed to lie
                down on us full length.

          legs, its contents spread out over the bed.
          Photographs of a long-forgotten vacation in Puerto Rico
          with Debbie. A Baseball glove.
          A high-school year book. Inside, a page of senior photos.
          He finds his own picture smiling at the thresh-hold of
          adulthood. Underneath his name it reads : "MOST NICEST

                         GUY"
          He studies the image a moment, flips to the inner cover,
          graffitied with hand-written messages from classmates
          including : "Henry don't be such a fag, Eddie Vibes"
          Henry puts the yearbook back in the box. Next to it are a

            Leisure is America's fastest growing
            industry. Did you know that? Think
            about it. Short work weeks, more
            vacation. People need something to
            do with all that time and that's where
            I come in. Leisure Villages, Inc.
            We buy land an hour or so outside
            your metropolitan centers. We set
            up the bungalows, dig some lakes, lay
            out a golf course, you know, fix the
            whole place up so it's usable. Then
            young, personable guys like me show
            the people around. It the guy seems
            tight, we point out the investment
            factor. If he's a swinger, well,
            the bungalows are very private. If
            he's a sports nut, we talk up skiing
            and fishing and tennis.

          AMY sits with a sleeping baby in her arms.

          

                                 AMY
                    I was with Damon for six years. He asked
                    me to marry him on the phone, because
                    he's just so different and cool like
                    that. Said he'd eventually get me a
                    ring, which he didn't, but he did buy
                    himself a ring because isn't that so
                    hilarious and cool that the guy is
                    wearing the ring? Then, my favorite part
                    is, I stayed with him even after he took
                    back his proposal, and introduced the
                    idea of a "relation vacation." Isn't
                    that a cute name? Let me explain the
                    concept: it involves dating a girl from
                    the time she's thirty two to the time
                    she's thirty nine, possibly robbing her
                    of the ability to bear children, and
                    then, after all that, wanting to take a
                    year off. And giving it a fun name that
                    you can put on t-shirts.
                           (looks at the baby, smiles)
                    I left him.

Chuck is focused on his PowerBook with the screen away from
us, Stan is doing tai chi amidst the FedEx containers.  It
feels a little surreal, all those containers surrounding
them.

Stan comes over, looks at the image on the computer.  It's a
sailboat with some technical specifications under it.

                     STAN
          I didn't know we had sailboats.

          attack unless he had everything just
          right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him
          and said, General, if you're not going to
          use my army, could I borrow it for a
          while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant
          just said, let's go.

                         GORDO
             People have tried this before, Jake.
             It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and
             his crew went on vacation in Chicago
             for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched
             in L.A.
                         JAKE
             It never worked before because A, they
             didn't flush the bank enough; B, their

             You   know, this is kind of embarassing,

             I'm   afraid the ticket was in it. But

             While you're back there, could you make

The Salesgirl nods and disappears again.

                         MR. LEWTS
             Carolyn's down this weekend too.
Lily approaches. When she does, Jake pulls her close and
gives her a loving kiss on the lips. It throws Lily for
a second.
                         LILY
             Uh... Everything okay?

             Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my

Lily and Mr. Lewis exchange handshakes.
                         JAKE
             I'm sorry, honey.    I'm almost done.
Jake taps Lily on the back with the hand wrapped around

sycamores.  The tower is immense.  A single ladder runs up

                         SKIPPER
          This is a working ship.  Promptness
          is not a luxury, it's a necessity,
          as is the work to maintain her.  Had
          we been ready, I can assure you we

          I'll be frank with you.  This was
          his mother's idea.  A romp through
          the Caribbean on a sailboat sounds
          more like a vacation than an
          education if you ask me.

		Why, at this juncture, are you
		letting yourself be so concerned
		by business matters?

			     PARRISH
		I don't want anybody buying up my
		life's work and turning it into
		something it wasn't meant to be.  A
		man wants to leave something behind.
		And he wants it left behind the way
		he made it.  And he wants it to be
		run the way he run it -- with a sense
		of honor, of dedication, of truth.
		Okay?

			     JOE
		Okay.

			     PARRISH
		And I don't need your goddamn permis-
		sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't
		need anyone to tell me how to run my
		life.

			     JOE
		Easy, Bill.  You'll give yourself a
		heart attack and ruin my vacation.

	Allison and Susan together by a piano; Parrish, Quince and a
	distracted Joe are gathered near the terrace.  Joe's eyes
	are on Susan across the room.  Her eyes flicker towards him,
	aware of his gaze.

			(to Susan)
		...We're never all together two
		nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas,
		Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's
		going on?

			     SUSAN
		Nothing's going on.  Maybe he
		doesn't want to be alone.  He's go-
		ing to be sixty-five in a minute --

			     ALLISON
		...I don't know, Daddy seems funny
		to me.  Ever since Joe showed.  It's
		like he dropped from the clouds...

	Drew enters.  He nuzzles Susan's neck, out of the corner of
	her eye she sees Joe still observing them.

			     ALLISON (cont'd)
		...When Daddy walked in with him, he
		couldn't even remember his name.  Now
		he's his house guest.  And you know
		how he hates house guests.  What is
		going on?

they asked each other all the questions and are now out of
things to say.  It is too much for BUCK, the natural enemy
of silence, who suddenly claps his hands together and bursts
out animatedly:

                         gets back.

            fuck me. And I wanted someone to
            want me to fuck them. Maybe that

          IRA
          So I have to? I just stopped
          working at a supermarket two weeks
          ago. I'm trying to create some
          financial stability for myself.
          The first time I make any real
          money, I can't just give it to her.

          BOB
          Well that's very selfish.

          IRA
          Well you guys went on a cruise to
          Greece last year. Maybe you
          shouldn't have gone, and saved for
          her college education.

          MOM
          Oh, so after all we've done for
          you, we can't have any fun? We
          should never take a vacation?

          IRA
          I had to drop out of college after
          two years because you couldn't pay
          for it. Now I have to pay for
          hers? Let her figure it out. Let
          her get a job.

          BOB
          I didn't realize I raised such a
          selfish boy. When I was young I
          would have done anything for my
          family.

          IRA
          Then sell your house. Move into a
          smaller house. Use the extra money
          to pay for her college. Or tell
          her to work for a year or two, make
          some money, then she can pay for
          her own college. No one helped me
          out, I'm just digging out from
          under now.

          BOB
          Don't get so high up on your horse
          with all your Hollywood friends. I
          don't like what you're turning
          into.

	THE OUTER PART OF THE BAR AGAIN

	A silhouetted figure appears in the entrance doorway.  The
	word "chill" races from table to table and the place falls
	still.  The bartender pushes a button behind the bar and a
	buzzer goes off in the back room.  Boudreau gets up from his
	table and opens a small viewing port in the door.

	The silhouetted figure is now walking slowly past the silent
	tables.  It's Snyder and he's checking out every face in the
	place.

					BOUDREAU
			Twist, you know this guy?

					TWIST
				(taking a look
				through the viewing port)
			No.  Never saw him before.  He's a
			dick, though.

	Snyder walks all the way to the back, and then retraces his
	route.  About halfway back, he stops at one of the tables,
	recognizing a grifter he knows.  It's the Eirie Kid.

					EIRIE KID
			Hello, Snyder.  What are you doin'
			up here?

					SNYDER
			I'm on vacation.  You seen your
			friend lately?

					EIRIE KID
			Yeh, he packed it in and enrolled
			in detective school.

	Snyder, in no mood for jokes, grabs Eirie by the hair and
	slams his face into the table.  Eirie just stays there; he
	knows it doesn't pay to assault a detective.  Twist is
	watching all this intently from the viewing port.

					SNYDER
			You see him, you tell him to pay
			his debts before I get him.

	Eirie raises his head slowly, but says nothing.  There is a
	slight trickle of blood from his nose.  Snyder turns and
	walks slowly out of the bar.  When he is a safe distance
	down the street, the chatter and drinking resume.

								CUT TO:

	THE INSIDE ROOM AGAIN

	Twist gives an all clear signal and returns to the table
	where he and Boudreau were talking.  Boudreau reads from a
	list of names.  Twist listens with a certain preoccupation.
	He's still thinking about the little confrontation he just
	witnessed.

          water spills over the ring and down onto Prew.

          "accidentally" kicks over the second bucket.
