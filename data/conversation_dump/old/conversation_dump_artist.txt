                 can't deny it was convenient for me in
                 maintaining a low profile.  She was a

     YURI kisses his sleeping son, NICOLAI, now three years old.

     He places a gift at the end of his bed - an expensive-looking

     At the same time he spies an object in Nicolai's toy box - a toy
     gun.

     INT.  KITCHEN / LIVING ROOM - NEW YORK APARTMENT.  NIGHT.

     YURI tosses the toy gun in the trash.

      Bloom turns to Stephen and the Chink with a "this is crazy

      Bloom, Stephen and Penelope crouch nearby, watching her work.

      slides it across the table to him.

      On it, written over and over in a dozen different stylized

                         OUISA
          My god! The Kandinsky!
          0UISA runs into the living room. SHE can see by the
          discoloration on that wall that a painting is missing.

                         OUISA Y
          It's gone! Call the police!

                         FLAN
          There it is!
          An early abstract painting by Kandinsky leans against a
          Philadelphia Chippendale chair: the painting is wild and
          brilliantly colored.

                         0UISA
          Thank god!
          SHE picks the painting up and flips it around. It's a double
          sided painting. The artist, Kandinsky, had painted in
          different styles on either side of the canvas.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         2
          One side of the painting is geometric and somber; the other
          side is all chaos and brilliant colors.
          OUISA replaces the framed canvas on the wall where it
          belongs, but the side she chooses to display is the
          geometric side. SHE admires it.
          FLAN opens the door from the hall into

          THE OFFICE.
          A computer. Calendars. File cabinets. Bulletin boards with
          prints of paintings tacked on. FLAN checks - the slide
          projector is there. FLAN opens and closes cabinet drawers.
          OUISA appears in the doorway of the office.

                         OUISA
          We could've been killed.

                         FLAN
          Don't say that. The silver Victorian inkwell!
          FLAN runs past OUISA down the hall back to the living room.
          OUISA follows HIM back into

          OUISA in bed turns off the light.
           FLAN looks out the window onto the park.

          For a while. We almost lost it. If I didn't

EXT. COLUMBIA ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Lucien throws his jacket over Allen's shoulder and leads him
into the wild city around the corner.

                    LUCIEN
          Welcome to the edge of the world.

The sound of the IRT screeching takes us to the SUBWAY MAP
from Allen's dorm room which comes to life.

A RED LINE glides down the map from Columbia University all
the way...to Greenwich Village.

It's pure bohemia here.
                                                           17.


Smoke, artists flirting, arguing. Allen sees...

A black man making out with a white woman. An older, elegant
woman sharing a cigarette with a boy half her age.

She stares seductively at Allen. Lucien enjoying himself
immensely. This is what a first time looks like.

                    LUCIEN
          Allen in Wonderland.

Lucien grabs a DRUNK YOUNG GIRL from the crowd, kisses her
passionately. Then lets her go, keeps walking.

          Do you know her?!

                    LUCIEN
          No, and I don't plan on it. She
          tasted like imported sophistication
          and domestic cigarettes.


INT. BATHROOM, 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHT

A makeshift bar in a sink full of ice. Lucien scavenges

DAVID KAMMERER, the man we saw dead at the film's opening,

                    DAVID
          What there is, darlings and
          demoiselles, is a circle. Life is
          round. Patterns, routines, a wheel

She's opened the package.  She pulls out the bottles of salsa
and the letter.

                     CHUCK
          Our apologies that it never made it to

          He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry

There is a moment where neither knows what to say.

                     BETTINA
          You look familiar.

Her eyes start to register recognition.  She glances at the
magazine with Chuck's picture on it.  She picks it up.

                     BETTINA
          I can't believe this.  I -- I -- They
          are... You're a gifted artist.  You're
          into something very powerful.  Primal.

BATEMAN 
Come on, you dumb son of a bitch. 
(Helping him into his jacket) 
I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a 
bottle of Absolut waiting for us.

INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
The living room floor has been meticulously covered with 
newspaper.

Owen is slumped drunkenly in a white Eames chair, a glass 
in his hand. Bateman is looking through his CDs.

BATEMAN 
You like Huey Lewis and the News?

OWEN 
They're okay.
BATEMAN 
Their early work was a little too New Wave for my 
taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really 
came into their own, commercially and artistically.

Bateman walks to his bathroom, taking a large ax out of the
shower. He takes two Valium.

BATEMAN 
(Said partly from the bathroom) 
The whole album has a clear, crisp sound and a new sheen of 
consummate professionalism that gives the songs a big boost.
Bateman comes back out and leans the ax against the wall. 
He walks to the foyer and puts on a raincoat, watching Owen 
from behind ail the time.

BATEMAN 
He's been compared to ELvis Costello but I think 
Huey has a more bitter, cynical sense of humor.

Owen is absent-mindedly leafing through the Barneys 
catalogue.

OWEN 
Hey, Halberstam?

BATEMAN 
Yes, Owen?

Bina lobs the little army man into a trash can across the

          Anyway, this is the other artist I
          was telling you about. Her stuff is

A buoyant Afropunk beat wafts through the bedroom. Bina plops
down on the bed next to Alike.

                    ALIKE
          This is straight. You'll burn me a

                     BINA
          Yeah, I have a bunch of other
          stuff, too.
              (beat)
          So who do you hang out with? I
          don't really see you with anybody.

Alike shrugs and rifles through her backpack. She pulls out
her composition book. Awkward silence.

                    BINA (CONT'D)
          I didn't mean it like that. I was
          just asking because I was curious.
          I don't really like anybody that
          goes there either.

                    ALIKE
          My friend Laura used to go there.
          Not now, but she's going back.

      Alone, he looks around the dressing room. At the walls. The
      ceiling fan. Finally at his reflection. He holds his own

      Slowly, inevitably the sound from the auditorium grows.
      Thousands of people shouting his name: "JAMES BROWN JAMES

            Lucy was a potentially fatal
            millstone on both our necks.  There
            was absolutely no choice but to cut
            her adrift and hope her memory was
            fucked.

GONZO unrolls a couple of bills -- pays off a CAB DRIVER --
waves to LUCY in the back with her paintings.  She's starting
to come down...

GONZO gets back in the WHITE WHALE and slaps his hands
together as if washing his hands of the situation.

                           Vexing people, the samurai. Blood-thirsty,
                           honorable, cruel, fabulousl y artistic. Wanted to
                           write a book about them for years, but no

     The room is filled with unframed canvasses, many of them
     copies of paintings by the Old Masters.

     Whale rolls out the easel, lifts a half-painted canvas into
     position.  He stares at the blotches of color, trying to
     remember what he intended to paint.

     Whale pulls out a heavy volume on Rembrandt, opens to a
     black-and-white plate of "The Polish Rider."  We CUT TO:

     INT. WHALE HOUSE - DUDLEY - NIGHT (1908)

     A rough pencil outline of the same painting.  Whale, age 16,
     sits on his bed, ignoring the roughhousing of the three
     younger BROTHERS who share the room.  The door opens and
     Whale's mother SARAH enters.

                    I have my class tonight.

     Both have Midlands accents, like head colds that flatten
     their speech.  Whale holds up the sketch to show his mother.

                                     SARAH WHALE
                    Don't get above yarself, Jimmy.
                    Leave the drawring to the artists.

     Whale squeezes the pad behind the bed, jumps up.

                    Quite so, mum.  To the privy.

     And he heads cheerfully out of the room.  His mother shakes
     her head.

     But Whale is already out the door.  We CUT TO:

     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

     Whale studies his face in the mirror.  He gives his white

                    that.

     Clay takes a moment to size up Whale -- whose innocent,
     slightly befuddled smile makes him appear about as
     threatening as a box of cornflakes.

     when a flash of lightning reveals the face of the Monster.

          The modern stalls are crowded with trendy BOHEMIANS. Abstract
          lines, speckles of color. We drift away... and find Margaret,
          alone in her stall with Jane. Margaret sits patiently,
          surrounded by Big Eye paintings and charcoal portraits. In
          contrast with the neighbors, her work seems... quaint.

          Beat -- then she nods, agreeing. She gestures.
          The little BOY sits. Margaret clips a fresh sheet of paper,
          sharpens her charcoal... and... goes motionless. Studying the
          boy's face. He gazes back.
          Then -- inspired, she begins sketching his EYES. Large and
          exaggerated. Then she fills in the shape of his head. His
          ears. His jaw.
          In a rush, his likeness appears. The parents come over to
          peek -- then gasp. Margaret is good. She sketches faster.
          Focused. Until a LOUD, PLUMMY VOICE drifts in...

           Your work is very powerful. There's
           so much emotion in those eyes.
          OUCH! Walter's smile collapses.

                          TIPSY LADY
           Is something wrong?

                          WALTER

                          (REELING)
           Huh? Uh... no. No. I just didn't
           realize you meant... the waif.

                          TIPSY MAN
           (beat; he CHUCKLES)
           Oh, I get it...! The artist doesn't
           wanna part with his favorite piece...
          The man winks, then pulls out a WAD OF BILLS.
          Walter stares morosely.

          INT. HUNGRY I - LATER

          Walter sits at the bar, toasted, drinking. In a dark place.
          His misery is interrupted by happy Banducci, groping two GALS.

                          BANDUCCI
           Hello, Picasso! Nice crowd, eh?

                          WALTER

           closet you parked me in.

           Whoah! Watch it with the purple

          Banducci PUSHES Walter away.

           25.

                         
          In reaction, Walter sloppily SMACKS him.
          Riled, Banducci suddenly takes a SWING! Walter stumbles, and
          Banducci's punch accidently HITS the GIRL.
          Ow! She topples. Walter gasps.
          He SWATS Banducci -- then RUNS! Cameras FLASH. Wild whoops.
          Walter barrels down the hall, Banducci chasing. The brawl's
          gone nuts. Walter grabs a Waif and SMASHES it over Banducci's
          head. CRASH! Banducci drops.

           Don't even try, Walter. He doesn't
           speak a lick of English.
          Walter stares hungrily.

          ANGLE - OLIVETTI
          glides into the club -- a vision of perfection with his slick
          hair and sunglasses. He approaches closer, closer... when he
          gets distracted. By one of Margaret's Big Eye PAINTINGS.
          Walter gasps. He nudges Margaret.
          Olivetti peers at the artwork. Intrigued. Then -- excited.
          He starts gesturing and yapping in ITALIAN. The Blondes shout
          back. Everyone is getting worked-up.
          The big-bosomed Blonde turns to Walter.

                          EUROPEAN BLONDE
           Mr. Olivetti is enchanted with the
           painting. He would like to know...
           who is the artist?

          ANGLE - MARGARET AND WALTER
          The moment of truth. Margaret opens her mouth... and no sound
          comes out. She clenches up. Stomach tight. Mute.
          Walter gives her a second -- tick tock tick tock. Then -- he
          leaps into Opportunity. He SMACKS his hands.

                          WALTER
           I am!
          Walter swoops over and grabs Olivetti in a hearty clasp.

                          WALTER
           It's a delight to meet you, Signore!
           Buon giorno! Have you been an art
           lover for long..?
          We move in tight on MARGARET, as the SOUND DIALS DOWN.

                          WALTER'S VOICE
           I call that piece "The Waif." Isn't
           it striking? With its juxtaposition
           of girl, cat, and stairs... and its
           almost Flemish use of underpigment...
          The SOUND dims... then goes SILENT.
          Margaret stares in shock, unmoving.
          Time seems to stop. She is frozen in grief. Until --

           That's worth more than 1000 critics!
           (he CLAPS his hands)
           Hey, maybe she'll come to our opening.

           But... isn't it strange? Artists get
           shown. They don't build their own
           galleries.

           Says who?! Like John Q. Public cares?
           He's FED UP with abstract neoformalism!
          She responds -- but he sexily puts his finger to her mouth.

           He digs real art. Your art! It's
           beautiful. You're beautiful...
          Walter starts rubbing against her, dancing sensually. She
          laughs, embarrassed, her wet paint brushes smearing his chest.
          She relents and relaxes. They dance around...

           Yeah. Cute little thing. I'd stare

           get out my Brownie and snap a photo...

          a tiny brush, quickly detailing the tear on a child's cheek...
          when the doorbell CHIMES.
          Hm? Margaret puts down her brush, wipes her hands, then
          hurries out. She opens the door... REVEALING THAT WE'RE IN A
          DIFFERENT HOUSE. A GIANT, PHENOMENAL 1960s EXTRAVAGANZA.

           Oh, is that your studio?

          A room full of MDHs and Keanes.
          Dee-Ann stops, puzzled. She glances at Margaret -- who has
          turned white as a ghost.
          Immensely curious, Dee-Ann slowly enters. She peers around at
          the two styles of paintings...
          A strained silence. Finally, Margaret whispers.

           W-Walter paints in here too.
          Hmm.
          Dee-Ann walks about, examining the canvases. Then, her gaze
          settles on the Big Eye that Margaret was working on.
          Below the easel is the wet brush on the open jar of paint.
          Margaret sucks in her breath. Dee-Ann sees this.

                          DEE-ANN
           Is Walter home??
          Margaret has no answer.
          The two friends look at each other... Dee-Ann waiting...
          wondering if Margaret is going to lie to her...

           Cenic was my nickname in Paris! All

          All life drains from his face. His eyes go glazed. He speaks
          mechanically. Tiredly...

                          WALTER
           I studied art in Paris. I went to
           school at the Beaux-Arts. The Grand
           Chaumiere. I spent hours in the

           Have you even been to Paris?
          Walter blanches. He shakes, broken up.
          He looks away, then staggers to a chair. He falls into it.
          Trembling. Not able to look her in the eye...

                          WALTER
           I wanted... I so wanted to be an
           artist. But -- it just never turned
           out good.

          Then, without comment, she storms away. She SLAMS the door

          standing in the doorway. Not speaking...

          Sweaty, chest heaving, Walter staggers towards her. His face

           I know you're being sarcastic, but
           these are all good ideas. Berlin war
           orphans... early self-portraits...

          Her eyes narrow.

                          MARGARET
           Get out of here. I'm trying to work.
          She brusquely spins away, back to the canvas.
          He shoots her an uncertain, dirty look. What just happened?

          A gargantuan spread. The LIFE ARTICLE is titled "The Man Who
          Paints Those Big Eyes." We PULL OUT...

          INT. NEW YORK TIMES - DAY

          Starchy John Canaday reads the article, gaping in utter
          disbelief. His desk says "JOHN CANADAY, SENIOR ART CRITIC."
          He also has Walter's BOOK, "Tomorrow's Masters Series." We
          WIDEN, revealing he's in the busy New York Times NEWSROOM.

                          CANADAY
           Four... five... SIX pages! Is there
           something here I'm missing?

           He's like -- the Hula-Hoop! He just
           won't go away...!
          He flips a page -- then his jaw drops.

                          (HE GASPS)
           Oh this is ABSURD!
          He GRABS for his phone.

          INT. WORLD'S FAIR HALL OF EDUCATION - DAY

          A panel flicks, and the huge empty space lights up. It's
          overwhelmingly cavernous, a bright, freshly-painted Space Age
          spectacular. Up high hangs The Masterpiece and its 100 kids.
          A sign says "TOMORROW FOREVER."
          Below, two tiny figures walk in: Canaday and an obtuse CIVIC
          LEADER. Canaday stares up in horror. Utterly stupefied.

                          CANADAY
           And WHO was on the selection committee?

                          CIVIC LEADER
           Oh! Well there wasn't a "committee,"
           per se. We just had a luncheon with

          A strange beat. The Jurors glance at each other.
          Walter reacts, like he just heard his name. He strides
          jauntily over to the witness stand.
          The BAILIFF gives the Judge a weird look. Then, he pulls out
          a Bible. Walter slaps down his hand.

          Walter bounces out, a bit manic. He runs back to his lawyer
          table, then spins to address the empty witness stand.

                          WALTER
           Mr. Keane. There has been a lot of
           innuendo and contradictory testimony
           about the genesis of the "big-eyed
           waifs." Would you mind clarifying to
           this court, once and for all, who
           spawned these paintings?
          Walter sprints back into the witness stand. He sits, then
          reacts coyly, as if he's surprised.

                          WALTER
           Why -- I created the children.
          Walter starts to stand again -- but the Judge SLAMS his bench.

           The choreography is not necessary.
           Just sit down and testify.
          Oh. Walter sits, then gathers his thoughts...
          We slowly PUSH IN. He smiles, wistfully...

                          WALTER
           I've had a wonderful life. I've been
           an artist, a world traveler, a friend
           of untold celebrities...
           (he gets misty-eyed)
           But when I look back at it all, when I

          Margaret stares at it in wonder, then quickly signs the cover.

          A brand-new gallery of Margaret's art. The walls are covered
          with NEWLY-PAINTED Waifs and MDH's. We GLIDE through the
          gallery... down the corridors of children and women...
          These paintings of big-eyed children are different. They're
          in magnificent colorful gardens, surrounded by joyful splashes
          of red, orange, green...

                         CLOSING CARDS:
          "Walter never accepted defeat, insisting he was the true
          artist for the rest of his life. He died in 2000, bitter and
          penniless. He never produced another painting."
          "Margaret found personal happiness and remarried. After many
          years in Hawaii, she moved back to San Francisco and opened a
          new gallery. She still paints everyday."
          We move CLOSER to one child, into the face, until the eyes
          fill the frame. And then... finally, we tilt down. Revealing
          that the child is smiling.

           FADE OUT.

        To scattered APPLAUSE, HOOTS and WHISTLES, Salome
        flounces offstage, the snake hung around her shoul-

           quick, high-profit gains in the 80s; he amassed a
           great fortune during the oil crisis. The son is
           sensitive, with complexes and artistic preoccupations,
           and lives under his shadow, trying to please the
           father in everything. Despite being a bit...
           homosexual, the son marries twice, just like the

           revenge.

           OFF HARRY
           I enjoyed making her up, styling her and dressing
           her. Lena could be the Shirley McLaine of "The
           Apartment" and the Audrey Hepburn of "Breakfast at
           Tiffany's", or even Goldie Hawn...

          

          
          Through the 16mm camera we can see the details of Lena's mutating
          image, how it gets constructed. It is true that she reminds us of the
          three actresses that Harry mentions in his voice-off. The members of
          the team assisting her (hair-stylist, makeup artist, costume designer,
          etc. and Lena herself) laugh heartily when they finish setting her up
          with Goldie's blonde long-hair wig with a fringe. And they stare,
          dumbfounded, when she is made-up as Audrey Hepburn in "Breakfast at
          Tiffany's" or "Sabrina". It's a style that fits Lena like a glove.
          They are all fascinated by the change, except Judit, estranged and
          angered by their playfulness.
          (For Judit, Mateo is constructing his ideal woman. She finds all that
          playing around obscene and dangerous).

19 INT. CREMORE NIGHT

The largest, noisiest, gaudiest dive we have yet seen, full to bursting
with bawdy CUSTOMERS even at this late hour. Therels a long bar, where men
and women stand three deep; lots of small tables; a dance floor; and a
stage on which four blowsy DANCING GIRLS are giving out with a ribald
number titled "My Father's Teeth Were Plugged With Zinc."
One end of the bar is entirely taken up by a huge woaden keg with an
attached hose. BAR ATTENDANTS DUMP the unfinished contents of glasses into
the open barrel top as a line of FAR GONE DRUNKS wait their turn for the
hose. Maggie, Jenny's mother, is close to the front of the line, very
drunk, hanging on to a mush-faced HOODLUM.

Two VISITORS watch. One has a pad and makes quick SKETCHES.

VISITOR ONE
Ought to be served in a trough, properly. Will you try some?

ARTIST
Probably. What is it?

VISITOR ONE
All-Sorts. It's made of all that's poured and not drunk, and any they can
salvage that's spilt.

Maggie GRABS the hose, staring at the Artist as she takes a drink. His
hand moves quickly an the page, SKETCHING her.

VISITOR
(to Maggie)
Your health.

She SPITS at him, insulted. The Artist steps forward, puts some of the
All-Sorts from the hose into his glass, and toasts Maggie. She nods and
turns away....
...as Johnny enters, dragging a large SACK across the crowded floor toward
a far door.

Johnny RUSHES toward a wooden pen in the center of the room. There are

He UPENDS the sack over the pit and a dozen live RATS tumble out. A

          And again, with her other fist this time. And now a shot to
          her shoulder. And another. It's painful to watch. But she's
          getting more and more numb to the blows.
          She inspects herself closely... and now reaches down and

          knees. Sara checks the bruises on her head and arms.

          They didn't need to know.
          Rebecca plops down on the bed. Sara looks around. It's a
          typical teenage girl's bedroom. Except, no posters. Just
          drawings covering the walls. The drawings are of teenage
          girls -- more precisely, they're different drawings of one
          teenage girl. They're odd, but compelling.

          INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

          Family and guest sit around a very nice, but not too large
          dining table. The contents of the house are expensive but
          not pretentious.
          Rebecca plays with her food, clearly not wanting to engage
          her parents, who are undaunted. All smiles and warmth.

                         SARA
          Rebecca's a pretty great artist.

                         JEFF
          Yeah, we think Rebecca is so
          talented.
          Rebecca shakes her head, uncomfortable with the flattery.

                         SARA
          She's an awesome roommate, too.

          Sara sits down as the TATTOO ARTIST escorts Rebecca upstairs.
          She looks giddy and nervous. Sara waves. When she's gone,

          "outta town for a gig. will call when back ; )"
          Sara's relieved.

                         STAIRS
          Rebecca walks slowly down the stairs. Wincing in pain. Sara
          puts the phone back in her pocket and stands up.

GUESTS in formal evening attire.  Behind him, a JAZZ TRIO and a 
STRIPTEASE ARTIST are hard at work.  Mr. Reindeer smiles and leans over 
very close to a beautiful WOMAN sitting to his left.

				MR. REINDEER
		Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet, 
		eating her curds and whey...  Along
		came a spider and sat down beside her,
		and extended his hand out to play.

With this, he reaches under the table between her legs.  She turns red 
and Mr. Reindeer laughs and lights a cigarette.

				MR. REINDEER
		Oh dear...  Another Miss Dull Cunt.

Reggie and Drop Shadow enter through a door on the other side of the 
room.  Reggie catches Mr. Reindeer�s eye and smiles.  Reggie reaches in 
his pocket and takes out a silver dollar - flips it in the air - catches 
it - and puts it back in his pocket.  Mr. Reindeer smiles and waves him 
over to the table.  He whispers something in Reggie�s ear - then gives 
him an envelope.

				MR. REINDEER
		When I gave you the silver dollar I
		forgot to give you the contents of
		this envelope.  They are to be 
		returned.  Show it just before the deed...

Reggie pockets the envelope - joins Drop Shadow - and as they are 
leaving the dining room, they join a woman, JUANA, who looks half-
Oriental, half-Cajun.  She wears a strange, short, yellowish-bleached

loud as he writes.

            Part of the artist's job is to get the work
            where I will see it.


EXT. LOWER EAST SIDE ST. - DAY

As he speaks, we see Jean pass the wall of a funeral parlor. He
spraypaints: "SAMO AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO GOD"

                        RENE (CONT'D, O.S.)
            When you first see a new picture, you don't
            want to miss the boat. You have to be very
            careful because you may be staring at Van
            Gogh's ear.

Jean signs his words with his 'logo', a triple pointed crown.

As he presses the spray can, we HEAR the roar of a breaker.

           Jean? Hold this, please.
                  (beat - he sees why Jean's so
                  distracted)
           You'll get there. But it's good to have
           something to fall back on. That's why I
           became an electrician. It pays the rent.
           Y'know, I'm an artist, too.

           I didn't know.

                      GREG
           I sculpt. I'm really just starting to find
           myself. How old are you? Twenty? You're
           just like I used to be. I'm forty-one. And
           I'm glad I haven't gotten any recognition.
           It gave me time to develop.

Jean watches Mary and Milo talking.

                  (to Milo)
           I can't tell you how happy I am with this

Mary yells across the room to Jean.

                       MARY BOONE (CONT'D)
                  (her tone impersonal)
           Excuse me - you - what's your name? Would
           you move those tools there and put them
           somewhere else?

He looks at her.

Milo watches to see what he's going to do.

Jean scrounges in his pockets, pulls out his Xerox cards, and
readies himself as Bruno and Andy enter BALLATO'S RESTAURANT.

                      BENNY
           What're you doing? You're doing something.

                      BASQUIAT
           He's the best painter in the world. I'm
           gonna give him one of these.

                      BENNY
           Don't give him anything, man. Your art's
           worth a lot. Trade. That's what real
           artists do with each other. Besides, he'll
           just use you. He's famous for that.

Benny watches Jean crosses the street. Jean passes the limousine.
Inside, the driver (a 24-year old Rasta) takes a hit from a joint

             I gave it to Maripol. She let me stay here

Jean hands him twenty dollars. Rockets hands him two dime bags.
As if thinking better, he hands the bill back to Jean.

                       ROCKETS
            Do one for me and it's free. How's that?

Jean re-pockets his money. He gestures to Rockets as if to say
"fine - it's a deal."

He and Benny sit down across the room and split a bag onto the
window, as before. This time, it's good. They lean back into it,
slumping down into the couch.

Nearby, Rene sits on a couch with THREE STREET KIDS - artists
(who we've seen at Milo's opening). They sit on their knees
looking out a window passing binoculars back and forth.

ARTIST #1 looks through the window with a pair of BINOCULARS. He
points down towards the street, trying to get Rene's attention.

                       ARTIST #1

He turns to look for Jean.

Jean pounds a nail into one of his pieces, nailing it directly
onto the wall. Everyone stares.

            Oh child... You got no respect. Didn't
            anyone teach you how to mount paintings?

CAMERA pulls back to reveal several of Jean's paintings - found
objects with paint on them.

            This is a very important season in New

A blink.

Silence.

We see the crowd in SLOW MOTION.

Everyone's eyes are shut.

                       RENE (O.S.; CONT'D)
           ... that we give it so much importance?
           Artists are respected by the poor because
           what they do is an honest way to get out of
           the slum using one's sheer self as the
           medium. The money earned is proof pure and
           simple of the value of that individual...
           The Artist.


INT. / EXT. GALLERY - NIGHT

The CAMERA rises higher and higher over the crowd and follows
Jean as he makes his way toward the street.

We begin to DISSOLVE into a MONTAGE of stills of ARTISTS:

                      RENE (O.S.CONT'D)
           The picture a mother's son does in jail
           hangs on her wall as proof that beauty is
           possible even in the most wretched. And
           this is a much different idea than the
           fancier notion that art is a scam and a
           rip-off. But you could never explain to
           someone who uses God's gift to enslave that
           you have used God's gift to be free."

In the dining room on the lower level sit Annina and Rene.
Nearby, at another, smaller table, are seated DAVID MCDERMOTT and
PETER MCGOUGH, two artists dressed in Victorian attire.

Annina beckons him.

Rene looks away from him and talks to a WAITER. Jean waves to

Annina and continues towards Bruno's table.

Seated at a large table are Andy, Bruno, Albert Milo, his wife
and parents, Henry Geldzahler, MELINA PORTOS (a young heiress)
and FRANCESCO and ALBA CLEMENTE and Mary Boone. Dinner's already
served.

At the large table, everyone watches as Milo makes a portrait of
Francesco in a beautiful leatherbound book. It belongs to Mr.
Chow, who is nearby at the bar.

                       ANDY WARHOL

and himself.

                      INTERVIEWER (O.S, CONT'D)
           ... had over fifty articles written about
           you, switched galleries - how many times? -
           DJ'd in the hottest clubs -

Jean looks out the window, yawns and rubs his eyes. He now sports
dreadlocks bundled into groups of spikes sticking out of his
head. He wears a wrinkled Wesleyan College T-shirt, paint-
splattered jeans, and no shoes; just out of bed, it would seem.

An INTERVIEWER - a balding Brit with all the humor of a bank
clerk - tries to buddy up with Jean on camera.

                       INTERVIEWER   (CONT'D)
           ... one of the youngest    artists ever to be
           included in the Whitney    Biennial, also
           produced a rap record.    It's said you're
           quite the ladies man -    even dated Madonna
           for a couple months!!!
                  (takes a breath)
           All at the ripe old age    of 24. One might
           ask: is there anything    left for Jean Michel
           Basquiat to do?

Jean and the interviewer face each other in front of one of
Jean's paintings. Jean stares at the interviewer, incredulous.

                       INTERVIEWER (CONT'D)
           What is it that gets you out of bed in the
           morning?

Jean walks off camera and disappears into his bedroom.

Shenge (the former limo driver, now working as Jean's assistant)
assembles stretchers.

Jean walks off camera like he just received a punch in the
stomach.

The filming of the interview becomes increasingly erratic.

                      INTERVIEWER (CONT'D)
           Let me... just... open something up here.
           You come from a nice, middle class,
           respectable home. Your father is an
           accountant. Why did you at one time live in
           a cardboard box in Tompkins Square?

Jean walks back into frame.

                       INTERVIEWER (CONT'D)
           Or rather, do you think you're being
           exploited or are you yourself exploiting
           the white image of the black artist from
           the ghetto?

                       BASQUIAT
           Are those the only two possibilities?

           You wanna French fry?

                      INTERVIEWER
           OK. One last thing. Is there any anger in
           you? Any anger in your work?

                      BASQUIAT
           Should there be?

                revealing an ATTIC. Nina sprawled on her stomach, stark naked, atop
                Raymond's naked body, her breasts resting on his chest, her legs
                apart, interlocked with his. They look directly at the CAMERA
                awaiting their cue with the calm resignation of two people waiting
                for the Wilshire bus. The MAKEUP GIRL appears in the shot spraying

                disappears as Eli's voice on the sound track calls, "ACTION." The

	          You're right.  You're right.  Of
	          course, one doesn't want to boast. 
	          It's a classic case of technology

	          See that with the rise in price of

	          is committed to film, the blood and
	          bones are gone anyway.  Only the
	          spirit, the illusion remains. 
	          Besides, what's real anymore?

         That's a problem. But don't let it ruin
         the movie. I mean, for example, use the
         orchids in a more dramatic way. Have
         some kind of bang-up, crazy action
         sequence in the swamp. Use the swamp
         better. It's a tremendous fictional
         world. A setting of great dramatic
         possibility.

To the gods, yes... that he is
fallible. As the weight shifts
back to the left pulled now by
powers inside the earth -- it's
alive, this swing, a living
sculpture -- and down through
contact, always down, into terra
firma, striking the ball crisply
-- with character -- a tuning
fork goes off in your heart, your
balls -- such a pure feeling is
the well-struck golf shot -- And
then the follow through to finish,
always on line -- The reverse 'C'
of the Golden Bear, the steelworker's
power and brawn of Carl Sandburg's
Arnold Palmer, the da Vinci of
Hogan, the unfinished symphony of
Roy McAvoy.

                MOLLY
What?    What's unfinished?

              TIN CUP
I have a short follow through --
my swing can look unfinished.

                MOLLY
Why?

              TIN CUP
Some say it's because that's the
best way to play through the winds
of West Texas... and some say it's
because I never finish anything.
You can decide. The point is every
finishing position is unique as if
that is the signature left to the
artist, the warrior athlete who,

                                                       9.
          finally and thereby, has asserted
          his oneness with and power over the
          universe by willing a golf ball to
          go where he wants and how and when,
          because that is what the golf swing
          is about...
                 (finally)
          It is about gaining control of
          your life, and letting go at the
          same time.

stares out, as a black domestic submissively fastens a
priceless bracelet around her lady-master's wrist.

               Stillness. A slow whirling 360-degree shot. The kitchen area
               is empty. The door of the portable toilet is open and no one
               is inside. The makeshift wardrobe is empty except for four or
               five hangers with shirts and jackets. There is no one at the
               desk or exercise bike.
          
               A sound, faint but persistent, like an intake of air.
          
               The bathroom. The toilet bowl has been ripped out and taken
               away, leaving a hole in the floor. Brownish water drips from
               the tap into the wash basin, which is indelibly stained. The
               drip makes a two-part sound and it matches the rhythm of the
               intake of air. One-two. Pause. One-two. The bathtub has been
               sprayed by a graffiti artist. Multi-colored swirls and
               arabesques.

               lotus position, breathing in serious meditation -- a deep

		I must take a firmer hand with them.
		They must know their father can be
		firm.  As our father was firm with
		us.

					LUCILLA
		Our father lost his way.  His

		So let the Senate talk.  They have
		no real power.

		Yes... yes... you always know the

		these matters...

		You know if I didn't have my duty to

		I should go away and paint pictures

A beat.  He is sleepy, he lies back on his bed.

		Still.  Always.

               I believe the phrase Dr. Hoag used
               was 'titanically remote'.  Who
               knows?  Maybe the trauma of having
               my face cut off pulled me out.  Or

               Terrible tragedy.
               Hoag was such a genius -- but
               selfish with his artistry.  I
               actually had to torture his

             Always is, sir. I can give you a
             rough profile; white male, thirty
             to thirty-four. Has some college
             but no degree. Neat in
             appearance. At least six feet
             tall. Very intelligent. Charming
             when necessary. He uses murder as
             a tool, probably in furtherance of
             a criminal endeavor. He's killed
             before and will again unless
             caught.
Laval and Reynaud write furiously.     Gillet is impressed.

             I saw who did this and I can show
             you what he looks like and you can
             go catch him.
Costa is unambiguously sincere. Grace's attitude softens
a bit. She tucks the garrote back in her bag.

                           GRACE

             Go ahead and draw the face of the

Grace taking everything in. Art books, sketch pads.
Piled high on the desk. She looks at the ceiling. SEES

Well, alright. There's something in me, Jack. I feel it. I don't know what
it is, whether I should be an artist, or, I don't know... a dancer. Like
Isadora Duncan.... a wild pagan spirit...

She leaps forward, lands deftly and whirls like a dervish. Then she sees
something ahead and her face lights up.

76 EXT. A DECK PROMENADE / AFT - SUNSET

Painted with orange light, Jack and Rose lean on the A-deck rail aft,
shoulder to shoulder. The ship's lights come on.

It is a magical moment... perfect.

                                   ROSE

So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?

                                   JACK

Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los
Angelas to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a
rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.

                                   ROSE

A whole ten cents?!

                             (not getting it)

Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But
only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the
real artists were doing.

Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel
like it.

                             (turning to him)

Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just
talk about it.

                                   JACK

Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster
until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the
surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.

                                   ROSE

You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?

Sure. If you like.

ROSE is ignoring this conversation. She has the art-nouveau comb with the

Isn't he great... the use of color? I saw him once... through a hole in
this garden fence in Giverny.

She goes into the adjoining walk-in wardrobe closet. He sees her go to the
safe and start working the combination. He's fascinated.

PUSHING IN on the rear window of the Renault, which is completely fogged
up. Rose's hand comes up and slams against the glass for a moment, making a
handprint in the veil of condensation.

INSIDE THE CAR, Jack's overcoat is liek a blanket over them. It stirs and
Rose pulls it down. They are huddled under it, intertwined, still mostly
clothed. Their faces are flushed and they look at each other wonderingly.
She puts her hand on his face, as if making sure he is real.

You're trembling.

			Well, it's not too hard. You'll

			sing. They'll applaud like crazy 
			'cause I can tell them that you're 
			really something and then the piano 
			and drum will give you a little 
			fanfare and you can sing and take 
			off your clothes or not sing. It 
			really doesn't make much difference, 
			really. But since you've never done 
			this before, singing might help.

          That's because you conned me! You
          both fucking conned me. You both
          got under me. You did!

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          Well that doesn't sound so good,
          either. I mean -- and I don't know
          what you're talking about, but --
          let's just assume you want to go
          with that story. Really? That's the
          story you want to go with? That's
          what you want the New York Times to
          hear? That you got conned by the
          very con men who you forced to
          entrap the members of Congress in
          the first place. That's what you
          want to go with? That doesn't sound
          so good for your whole thing.

Richie looks like he's going to be sick.

          And how ironic that the most
          creative minds, the ones who are
          working hardest to get the economy
          of New Jersey going, those are the
          ones that you round up. And why?
          Because what, they're the easiest
          to go after? And what about the
          real bullshit artists? You didn't
          even come close to the big leagues.
          Those big guys. The money men.

                    RICHIE DIMASO
          That's what I was trying to go
          after.

                    IRVING ROSENFELD
          I'm sorry to tell you, you got none
          of 'em.

          You know, Richard, I think we may
          call you as a witness, but
          otherwise you're done. I think you
          better go home.

                         Cook's Chicken used to be called

                         do my project based on this discovery 
                         as kind of a comment on racism... 
                         and the way racism is whitewashed 
                         over in our culture...

                         art object."

fitting in.

          class today. That was a tough
          exercise.

She makes him a little nervous.

A line of skeletons arranged along the walls. Tables
stacked with bones: skulls, spines, rib cages, hands
and feet. Each skeleton sports a label with a price in
U.S. dollars.
Crouched among the bones and packing crates are men work-

scrape and clean and decorticate. They skillfully
assemble their grisly creations, emotionless but like
artists.

                    your Dad and I had to Odessa, our
                    family's homeland, one summer, in
                    southern Ukraine. There's a
                    beautiful river there also named
                    Odessa.

                         live on a government wage.

               A skinny guy with a big nose, glasses and a ratty trench 
               coat taps Harvey on the shoulder. He is soft-spoken, a bit 
               shy and very odd -- a young ROBERT CRUMB.

               INT. HARVEY'S BEDROOM - 1980'S - DAY

               HARVEY and JOYCE lay there quietly, both exhausted. Joyce 
               turns over so her back faces Harvey. He puts his arm around 
               her.

               ANGLE ON JOYCE'S FACE 

               A tear drips down her cheek.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Joyce is straightening up the apartment. The place actually 
               looks halfway decent.

               THE DOORBELL RINGS

               Joyce opens the door. A guy in his 30's named FRED -- Hells 
               Angels tough guy meets sensitive artist -- stands at the 
               door. He's accompanied by a seven-year-old girl, DANIELLE.

                                     FRED
                         Hey, I'm Fred. You called me about 
                         the comic book?

                                     JOYCE
                         Right -- the artist. Come on in.

                         This is my daughter, Danielle. I had 
                         to bring her along. I hope you don't 
                         mind.

               Joyce leans down and addresses the girl, who holds a toy 
               horse.

                                     JOYCE

                         A pony.

               It's immediately obvious that Joyce is great with kids.

                                     JOYCE
                         A pony? What's his name?

                                     HARVEY
                         Joyce, open the door! I lost my keys 
                         again! Joyce!!

               ANGLE ON FRONT DOOR

               HARVEY'S ELDERLY NEIGHBOR struggles with her shopping cart 
               through the door.

               Harvey pushes past her to get in.

               INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT VESTIBULE

               Harvey knocks again. Nothing. Now he punches the door.

                                     HARVEY
                         Joyce!! Open the fucking door!!

               Suddenly the door opens. Loud music pours out. But it's not 
               Joyce, it's FRED, the artist.

                                     FRED
                         Hey, Harvey.

               Harvey just stares at him. Fred opens the door to reveal:

               JOYCE and DANIELLE dancing together with the stereo blasting.  
               They're having a ball.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               At the kitchen table, HARVEY looks over FRED'S sketches.

               JOYCE and DANIELLE are now building a house of cards on the 
               living room floor.

            How about something to eat?

            No, nothing.

The background music stops.

            Mmm, what am I gonna do with you?
                   (laughing)


As Lee walks over to the drawing board where Frederick is
sitting, he is seen intently cleaning some paintbrushes with
a rag.  Lee stands by him, leaning over the board, and looks
directly at him.  The table is filled with cans of brushes
and artist's equipment.

            God!

            And why didn't you come tonight?
            We all had a terrific time.  I
            really think you would have enjoyed
            yourself.

                   brushes and wiping
                   his hands with the
                   same rag)
            I didn't want to wind up abusing
            anyone.

                         LEE
            You're not going to abuse them.
            They're all so sweet.

                   for Lee's hand)

            with...who I really look forward to
            being with.

            Answer the man, Al, if he asks you
            a question.  Quick, before he
            thinks up another!

Evans moves to Sidney, trying to shepherd him out the way he
came.

                         EVANS
            Mr. Temple doesn't believe in press
            agents - does that answer you
            something?

ANOTHER ANGLE

Evans makes the mistake of laying a hand on Sidney's elbow.
Sidney doesn't like people touching him.  He reacts in
anger, as we have seen before - fixes a burning eye on Evans.

                         SIDNEY
            Take your hand off, lump!
                   (more politely, to Temple)
            No one believes in press agents,
            Temple, when they make claims they
            can't perform.  I got nothing to
            sell - I didn't come here to
            peddle - but if I tell a client
            that Hunsecker will give him space,
            it's not just talk!

Sidney stops briskly up the stairs into the corridor.
Evans, angry, is stalled for a moment of delay action by
mention of the magic name of Hunsecker.

                         EVANS
                   (after hesitation)
            Listen, you bull artist - !

                         TEMPLE
            Let him go, Al...

SIDNEY

But Sidney has already stepped to the phone booth and is
dialing.

                         SIDNEY
                   (to phone)
            Hello?  Mary, let me speak to J.J.,
            please...it's Sidney Falco...

REVERSE ANGLE

Shooting past Sidney in foreground onto Temple and Evans
beyond, they watch him, open-mouthed.  Sidney notes their
reaction.

				BARTON
		I don't know, Garland; my place is 
		here right now. I feel I'm on the 
		brink of success-

				GARLAND
		I'd say you're already enjoying some.

	Barton leans earnestly forward.

				BARTON
		No, Garland, don't you see? Not the 
		kind of success where the critics 
		fawn over you or the producers like 
		Derek make a lot of money. No, a 
		real success � the success we've 
		been dreaming about � the creation 
		of a new, living theater of, about, 
		and for the common man! If I ran off 
		to Hollywood now I'd be making money, 
		going to parties, meeting the big 
		shots, sure, but I'd be cutting myself 
		off from the wellspring of that 
		success, from the common man.

	He leans back and chuckles ruefully.

				BARTON
		...I guess I'm sprouting off again. 
		But I am certain of this, Garland: 
		I'm capable of more good work. Maybe 
		better work than I did in Choirs. It 
		just doesn't seem to me that Los 
		Angeles is the place to lead the 
		life of mind.

				GARLAND
		Okay Barton, you're the artist, I'm 
		just the ten percenter. You decide 
		what you want and I'll make it happen. 
		I'm only asking that your decision 
		be informed by a little realism � if 
		I can use that word and Hollywood in 
		the same breath.

	Barton glumly lights a cigarette and gazes out across the 
	floor.

	Garland studies him.

				GARLAND
		...Look, they love you, kid � 
		everybody does. You see Caven's review 
		in the Herald?

				BARTON
		No, what did it say?

				GARLAND
		Take my copy. You're the toast of 
		Broadway and you have the opportunity 
		to redeem that for a little cash � 
		strike that, a lot of cash.

	Garland looks at Barton for a reaction, but gets none.

				GARLAND
		...The common man'll still be here 
		when you get back. What the hell, 
		they might even have one or two of 
		'em out in Hollywood.

	Absently:

				LIPNIK
		I apologize, Barton.

				BARTON
		No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been 
		a great help �

				LIPNIK
		You don't have to cover for him. 
		It's noble of you, but these things 
		happen in business.

				BARTON
		Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much 
		better if you could reconsider �

				LIPNIK
		Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to 
		pull this out of your head. If that 
		sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to 
		you, goddammit, I will. I respect 
		your artistry and your methods, and 
		if you can't fill us in yet, well 
		hell, we should be kissing your feet 
		for your fine efforts.

	He gets down on his knees in front of Barton.

				LIPNIK
		...You know in the old country we 
		were taught, as very young children, 
		that there's no shame in supplicatin' 
		yourself when you respect someone.

	Barton stares, horrified, at Lipnik, on the ground at his 
	feet.

				LIPNIK
		...On behalf of Capitol Pictures, 
		the administration, and all a the 
		stockholders, please accept this as 
		a symbol of our apology and respect.

	BARTON'S POV

	Lipnik kisses his shoe and looks up at him.

	Behind Lipnik the pool glitters.

	BARTON'S ROOM

	The cut has a hard musical sting. Out of the sting comes a 
	loud but distorted thumping noise.

	We are looking down, high angle, form one corner of the room. 
	We are presented with a motionless tableau: Barton sits, 
	hunched, in the far corner, elbows on knees, staring at the 
	bed in front of him. He wears only trousers and a T-shirt 
	and his body and face glisten with sweat. The bed's sheets 
	have been stripped and the ratty gray mattress has an enormous 
	rust-red stain in the middle.

	After a beat, in the foreground, the only motion in the scene: 
	A bead of tacky yellow wall-sweat dribbles down the near 
	wall.

	Silence, then the thumping repeats, resolving itself to a 
	knock at the door.

	Barton rises slowly and crosses to the door.

               INT. COURTROOM - SOON AFTER

               Mr. Gifford, the Crawford's neighbor, is on the stand.   Willy
               questions him, standing by the Prosecution Table.
               Behind him, the court is standing-room-only. REPORTERS,
               SKETCH ARTISTS, SPECTATORS. Nunally, sitting near the front.
               Lobruto, standing at the back.
               Crawford writes intently on a legal pad, filling pages with
               dense scribble.

                                        WILLY
                           So - between the time you heard the
                           first gunshot and called 911, and the
                           time of Mr. Crawford's arrest - you
                           had the Crawford house in view?

                                       GIFFORD
                           Yes. I was very concerned about
                           Jennifer. She was a lovely woman.

                                        WILLY
                           No one but Thomas Crawford came in or
                           out?

                                        GIFFORD
                           That's correct.

      She knocks on a door. Hears classical music playing
      softly inside, but no one answers. She tries the door.
      It's unlocked. The gift in hand, she pushes it open.

      She comes into an apartment which looks like it could
      belong to a professor. Sees a chess piece on the floor.
      Then a trail of them that lead her to an overturned chess
      table and, next to it, a body.
      The gash on the old man's head could have been caused
      by a fall into the corner of the table, or from a blow to
      it. She quickly tries to determine if he's breathing.

Blomkvist; his teenage daughter Pernilla; his sister

			Everybody and their mother was

INT. REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY

Delacroix sits in the first row with Sloan, RUTH, an African
American casting director.  LEVI, the musical director, also
black, is on the stage at the piano.

AUDITION MONTAGE

WE SEE singers, magicians, dancers, acrobats, comedians,
rappers.  Some good, most are terrible.  Many come out on
stage dressed like mammies, Stepin' Fetchit, slaves, pimps,
ho's, hustlers, and basketball players.  It is a cavalcade
of all the stereotypical roles one has seen.

ANGLE ON

Space.  LULU, a spoken word artist, goes her rendition of
"WAY DOWN ON THE SWANEE RIVER."

				DELACROIX (V.O.)

			were looking for?  The same old

Delacroix is a guest on the GARY BYRD show.  WLIB is the
number one black talk radio station in the nation.

										  91.


				GARY BYRD
			Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix.
			He is the creator of the highly
			controversial TV show MANTAN.
			Let's get right into it.  You have
			been called by some in the community
			a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom.
			Why does your show generate such
			feelings?

				DELACROIX
			Because race has always been a
			sensitive issue in this country.
			Gary, I have no problem with people
			disagreeing with the show, it's
			when folks start trying to mess
			with my inherent right as an
			artist, that's when I get mad.  No
			one, in any way, shape or form
			should be censored.

				GARY BYRD
			No matter how sexist or racist the
			material may be?

				DELACROIX
			Yes.  And I say yes because who is
			to judge?  Who is to stand before
			us and say this is righteous and
			this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?

				GARY BYRD
			But the line has to be drawn.

				DELACROIX
			Don't you people get it?  We're in
			the 21st Century.  Slavery was over
			four hundred years ago.  All that
			stuff people talked in the old
			days, it's over.  Folks always
			crying, white man this, white man
			that.  Let's all grow up.

Title: RKO 281
Genres:
Drama, 
	
	NEWSREEL The flickering images of an old newsreel, circa 1940
	
	Under the MGM logo we see the title: BOY WONDER WOWS HOLLYWOOD!
	
	The first image after the title is the imposing figure of ORSON WELLES, 

	climbing down from an airplane and surveying the world at his feet.
	
	Welles is 24 years old and somewhat handsome. Welles seems rather 
	uncomfortable in his own body, as if it could not possibly contain his 
	vast passions and appetites.
	
	Orson Welles is man who tears his way through life with incendiary 
	energy. He is at once inspiring and ferocious; visionary and coldly 
	ambitious. He is part artist, part fraud and all showman.
	
	A sonorous voice accompanies the newsreel. The voice is always grand, 
	occasionally sardonic.
	
	                         NEWSREEL VOICE 
	          He came to the town of magic and dreams a flashing 
	          star blazing through the firmament of illusion. And 
	          he promised to devour the world in a single gulp. He 
	          was 24 years old and his name was George Orson 
	          Welles. Sound the trumpets! Unfurl the banners, 
	          Hollywood! The Boy Wonder has arrived!
	
	Images of Welles as a baby and his early life fill the screen: Welles 
	in a crib; as a pampered schoolboy; at dance class; drama club; dressed 
	up for a magic show. As we hear:
Title: RKO 281
Genres:
Drama, 
	
	And we see Welles racing heroically into making his first movie:
	
	In varying KANE makeups he tears through scenes and actors: laughing 
	with AGNES MOOREHEAD on the cabin set; charming RUTH WARRICK on 
the 

	breakfast table set; berating DOROTHY COMMINGORE on the Great Hall 
	set...
	
	He speeds back and forth and back and forth from the set to the camera 
	in the Campaign Headquarters set, never happy with the shot. . .
	
	Gregg Toland watches, bemused, as Welles shifts tiny prop pieces on the 
	set. . .
	
	Welles bullies and screams and pleads and seduces. Like an obsessed 
	artistic tornado he is seemingly everywhere at once. We see him 
	rejecting matte paintings and in makeup and rewriting the script and 
	trying on costumes and selecting props and leaping into odd positions 
	looking for the perfect camera angle.
	
	It is very important in this sequence that we see the pressure building 
	... building ... building ... on Welles.
	
	"SING, SING, SING" continues On the Xanadu stairway set Welles behind 
	the camera, filming actor Paul Stewart

conspiratorial. Then Einar's pulled back into the select

          He tails off. Face-to-face...
          BANG! BANG! Pounding on the door. Gina motions Martin out
          of sight as she opens the door...
          .It's Biko, the soft-spoken Somali taxi-driver. He grins.
          Tries teasingly to peek past her into the apartment.

          She puts her foot against the door, inscrutable. Biko drops

               I enjoyed your little comedy last
               week, Jonson. You have potential,
               great potential.

                            JONSON
               Thank you, my lord.

                            OXFORD
               But it's politics did seem to have
               quite an effect on the Tower. My
               father-in-law's men felt it quite
               seditious.

                            JONSON
               Politics? My play had nothing to do
               with politics! It was just a simple
               comedy--

                             OXFORD
               That showed your betters as fools who
               go through life barely managing to get
               food from plate to mouth, were it not
               for the cleverness of their servants.
                      (beat)
               All art is political, Jonson.
               Otherwise it would just be decoration.
               And all artists have something to say,
               otherwise... they'd make shoes. And
               you're not a cobbler, are you, Jonson?

     As they enter the center of the maze, Oxford turns to
     his servant.

     Francesco steps forward and hands Jonson a leather
     bound manuscript. Jonson looks at it confused and
     opens it.

                            JONSON
               A play, my lord?

          some kind of revenge stunt on Michael
          Moritz and Sequoia capital. and that it

          I didn't know whether to dress for the
          party or the business meeting so I kind
          of dressed for both.
          We see that most of the employees, especially the women, are
          dressed to go to an after-work, late-night party.
