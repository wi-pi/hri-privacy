                Well, it's not really my decision.

                  35,000 acres on Kaua'i my family has

                  Ever since my father died nine years
                  ago, I'm the sole trustee, the
                  controlling trustee, so I hold all the
                  cards. Why does so much have to depend
                  on me -- my wife, my daughters, my
                  family's land? I just want to hide.

                          MATT
                I don't want it to go to Holitzer. I
                don't want it to go to anyone. I want
                to keep it.

                For Christ's sake. We can't move
                without your approval. And we don't
                want to.

      Hugh tries forcing Matt's hand.   Matt resists.

                          COUSIN HUGH
                Your head's not right, Mattie. Your
                head's not right. You want a couple
                days to think it over? Take a couple
                days.

                          MATT
                I don't need a couple days. I have the
                authority, and this is what I want. I
                haven't wanted something in a long
                time. We have other businesses we're
                converting to corporations. We can
                figure it out.

                          COUSIN SIX
                But it's utterly unproductive land. It
                doesn't generate enough income to pay
                the goddamn taxes.

                          COUSIN HUGH
                You're the trustee. You know better
                than anyone we only have seven years
                left.

                          MATT
                Then I have seven years to figure out
                how to keep it.

      Cousin Hugh draws a long breath, looks up at the sky, then
      back at Matt.

                          COUSIN HUGH
                We'll come after you. Just because
                you're a lawyer doesn't mean the rest
                of us would be afraid to come after
                you. But nobody wants to do that.
                We're family.

               Come on -- let's drink to it!


     FULL SCREEN - BLUE CAPSULE

     Dietrich cracks it open -- powder sifts into a big high-
     ball glass filled with mescal.  he hands it to Archer.

                             DIETRICH
               How about one of your famous
               toasts, Caz?

     They all look expectantly at Archer... he's at a loss.

                             ARCHER
               To old jobs, new jobs and -- uh --
               blow jobs?

     Silence -- then they crack up.  Reluctantly, Archer
     swallows the tumbler of mescal... he fights back the urge
     to puke.

                             LIVIA
               Enough business, Caz.  Let's
               dance.

                             ARCHER
               Sorry... I don't...

     She drags him onto the glass floor.  Cindee puts on some
     MUSIC as Archer's head begins to spin.  The girls start
     "dancing," grinding Archer between their taut bodies.  He
     tries to avoid it, but Livia kisses him -- hot, moist.

                             LIVIA
               Remember the Charger's game, Caz?
               The owners box?  We did it four
               times.

                             ARCHER
               Sure I remember... Once a quarter,
               right?

     Archer's eyes fall on the series of abstract paintings.

     The twisted renderings make his head spin worse... as he
     starts to hallucinate... surrounded by enemies -- he
     struggles to regain control of his battered psyche.

                             LIVIA
               Caz?  Are you okay?

     He pulls away and stumbles down the stairs -- toward the
     kitchen.

     INT. SASHA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Archer wakens.  Sasha is tugging off his pants.

                             ARCHER
               Uh -- can't we just talk?

                             SASHA
               Talk?  The only talk I ever heard
               from you was 'take it off,' 'sit
               on it,' 'I'll pay you tomorrow.'

     She pulls out some fresh clothes -- and dumps them on
     him.

                             SASHA
               Take off the rest of those rags
               and get dressed.  Then get out.

                             ARCHER
               Not until I finish my business
               with your brother.

                             SASHA
               I told him to keep those creeps
               away -- but you're just too big an
               attraction.
                      (calming herself)
               Look, if the F.B.I. finds out
               you've been here -- I'll lose my
               son.  So please, just go.

     For the first time, Archer sees not a hardened felon --
     but a frightened, protective mother.  And he realizes the
     effect his own relentless obsession has had on her.

                             ARCHER
               I know I've done some things that
               made your life harder...

                             SASHA
               How would you?  You walked out and
               never looked back.

     ADAM enters, heading for his toys -- his presence cooling
     Sasha's deep-seated anger.  Archer finishes dressing.

                             ARCHER
               I'm not the same person you
               remember.  And for what it's
               worth, I'm sorry...

     Her harsh look softens imperceptively -- like that of a
     woman trying to hate someone she still loves.

    IRVING ROSENFELD, not a small man, gets dressed and
    meticulously constructs his combover. Camera WRAPS AROUND,
    see his hands with rings adjust his dark velvet suit, up to
    his face, serious, concentrated, intense, he is composing
    himself before a performance.

    Irving is now dressed, ready, and walks down the hall to
    another room.

3   SECOND PLAZA HOTEL ROOM

    Irving composes himself -- looks     
    into cramped surveillance closet, there are FBI Agents -- we
    only see their hands and arms -- he looks at monitors -- sees
    a BLACK AND WHITE IMAGE OF ANOTHER ROOM ON MONITOR: MAYOR
    CARMINE POLITO, swath of salt and pepper hair, cream suit,
    pinky ring, Rotary Club pin -- ALONG WITH CARL ELWAY, preppie
    shady businessman.

    He exhales pressure, turns as CAMERA PANS TO: SYDNEY PROSSER
    (who will also be known for some time as EDITH GREENSLY),
    stylish crafty smart. They stare at each other intensely --
    they have a deep and emotional relationship. A DOOR BANGS
    OPEN, and in walks RICHIE DIMASO, Bronx-born. He stands
    there.

               You feel like the two of you
               understand something that nobody
               else gets. I could just tell her
               everything about myself. And I
               never had anybody like that in my
               life before. I felt like finally, I
               can truly be myself without being
               ashamed, without being embarrassed.

     Irv leads Sydney into a small, dingy Manhattan office on an
     upper floor.

               What is this place? Do you sell art

               Yeah, sometimes. This is my office.

               I know it's your office, but, you
               have these other places. What's
               this for? Why did you bring me
               here?

                         SYDNEY PROSSER
               You're their last resort? Because

               heading to 18%.

          Everything's fine, everything's
          good. It's all good. It's all good.
          I just hope the other part of this
          is all good. And real. Because
          we're real. You know that. You deal
          with us. We're a real organization.
          We deal with you, we don't know
          what we're dealing with.

Everyone stares increasingly tense at Tellegio in silence.
This could go wrong at any minute. Tellegio looks over to
Richie and points to the Sheik.

          Al, I'll be right behind you, okay?

Paco Hernandez/Sheik stands up and reaches over to Tellegio
to shake his hand. Irving panics. THE MENACING DEEP BASS
INTRO OF "WHITE RABBIT" FADES UP ON THE SOUNDTRACK.

          It is great doing business with
          you. The investment is real. It was
          a pleasure to meet you.

Irving exhales in relief that Paco managed to say anything
passable in Arabic.

Carmine nods.

          Carmine, listen to me carefully, if

          the bank of our choice in the next

Irving.

          I appreciate the fact that you all
          came in person, but the trip was
          really unnecessary because this
          whole thing could have been done
          with a simple wire transfer. As a

                          SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE 


                     by Marc Norman &amp; Tom Stoppard



       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. DAY.

       SKY. Over which a title "LONDON--SUMMER 1593" appears. 
       Title card: In the glory days of the Elizabethan theatre 
       two playhouses were fighting it out for writers and 
       audiences. North of the city was the Curtain Theatre, 
       home to England's most famous actor, Richard Burbage. 
       Across the river was the competition, built by Philip 
       Henslowe, a business with a cash flow problem...

       ...The Rose...

       Gradually a building is revealed, The Rose Theatre, three-
       tiered, open to the elements and empty. On the floor, 
       roughly printed, a poster--torn, soiled, out of date. It 
       says:

       SEPT. 7TH &amp; 8TH AT NOON

       MR. EDWARD ALLEYN AND THE ADMIRAL'S MEN AT THE ROSE 
       THEATRE, BANKSIDE

       THE LAMENTABLE TRAGEDIE OF THE MONEYLENDER REVENG'D

       OVER THIS the screams of a man under torture. The screams 
       are coming from the curtained stage.

                 No, no, we haven't the time. Talk 
                 prose. Where is my play?

                           WILL
                     (tapping his forehead and 
                      heading out the door)
                 It is all locked safe in here

                           HENSLOWE
                 God be praised!
                     (then doubt)
                 Locked?

                           WILL
                 As soon as I have found my muse

       EXT. STREET. OUTSIDE WILL'S HOUSE. DAY.

       WILL lives in a crowded area of the city. Hawkers are 
       crying their wares, tract-sellers, delivery boys, and 
       merchants go about their business. HENSLOWE catches up 
       with WILL as he strides purposefully along.

                           HENSLOWE
                     (catching up)
                 Who is she this time?!

                           WILL
                 She is always Aphrodite.

                           HENSLOWE
                 Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind 
                 the Dog and Trumpet?

                           WILL
                 Henslowe, you have no soul so how can 
                 you understand the emptiness that 
                 seeks a soulmate?

                 What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?

                           FENNYMAN
                 The theatres are all closed by the 
                 plague!

                           HENSLOWE
                 Oh, that.

                           FENNYMAN
                 by order of the Master of the Revels!

                           HENSLOWE
                 Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the 
                 theatre business.
                     (they stop)
                 The natural condition is one of 
                 insurmountable obstacles on the road 
                 to imminent disaster. Believe me, to 
                 be close by the plague is a bagatelle 
                 in the ups and downs of owning a 
                 theatre.

                           FENNYMAN
                 So what do we do?

                           HENSLOWE
                 Nothing. Strangely enough , it all 
                 turns out well.

                           FENNYMAN
                 How?

                           HENSLOWE
                 I don't know. It's a mystery.

                 Burbage says you have a play.

                           WILL
                 I have. And chinks to show for it.

       His drink arrives. WILL places a sovereign on the bar.

                 I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe.

                 I hear you have a new play for the

                 Not new--my Doctor Faustus.

                           WILL
                 I love your early work. "Was this the 
                 face that launched a thousand ships 
                 and burnt the topless towers of

                 better. The Massacre at Paris.

                 My lady, this play will end badly. I 
                 will tell.

                           VIOLA
                     (twice as firmly)
                 You will not tell. As you love me and 
                 as I love you, you will bind my breast 
                 and buy me a boy's wig!

       EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. NIGHT.

       WILL spots a gaggle of MUSICIANS approaching, carrying 
       instruments. WILL recognizes them.

                           WILL
                 Master Plum! What business here?

                           MUSICIAN
                 A five shilling business, Will. We 
                 play for the dancing.

       The sound of hooves gives hardly any warning as a 
       GALLOPING HORSEMAN thunders through the MUSICIANS who 
       have to leap out of the way. It is WESSEX arriving at the 
       house, with his usual good manners. Will watches WESSEX 
       skid to a halt and enter the house.

       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. BANQUETING ROOM. NIGHT.

       WILL has got in with the MUSICIANS. Competently enough he 
       strums along with them on the bandstand. Two dozen guests 
       are enough to crowd the space for dancing. WILL glances 
       around, looking for THOMAS KENT. He stops a passing 
       SERVANT, helping himself to a snack off the man's tray.

                           SERVANT
                 Musicians don't eat, Sir Robert's 
                 orders.

                           WILL
                 I seek Master Thomas Kent.

       It means nothing to the SERVANT who moves on. ANGLE ON 
       WESSEX and SIR ROBERT.

       It takes a moment for WESSEX to realise he is alone in

       EXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. DAY.

       Hundreds of people are converging on the theatre. Among 
       them is the Puritan MAKEPEACE, vainly exhorting the 
       crowds to run away from sin

                           MAKEPEACE
                 Licentiousness is made a show, vice is 
                 made a show, vanity and pride likewise 
                 made a show! This is the very business 
                 of show

       But MAKEPEACE is being carried inexorably through the 
       main doors of the theatre.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

       The ADMIRAL'S MEN are all in costume, and are in a buzz 
       of nervous excitement. ALLEYN, dressed for "MERCUTIO," is 
       giving last minute instructions to PETER. JAMES and JOHN 
       HEMMINGS are arguing about the timing of their entrance. 
       FENNYMAN in his apothecary's cap is agonising over his 
       lines. WABASH is stuttering over his. Alone in his 
       dejection in the midst of all this, is WILL, dressed for

                           "ROMEO."
                 FENNYMAN approaches him, apothecary's 
                 cap in hand.

                           FENNYMAN
                 Is this all right?

       WILL nods, miserable. SAM has found a private corner. He 
       is gargling into a basin. He looks worried and furtive.

       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM. DAY.

       The audience is gathering.

                         and throws nine hundred men out of work.

INT. WHEREHOUSE RECORDS - MALL - DAY

We see a group of buzz-cut young toughs, walking in
formation, hunched over, sneering and wearing
sleeveless U.S. Army fatigue jackets. None of these
damaged-looking kids is over the age of fourteen.
They pass to reveal this legend on their backs:
LINCOLN SURF NAZIS.

Angle on Mike Damone and Mark Ratner, who are
standing by the upcoming concert list posted on the
door to Wherehouse Records. Damone sees the Surf
Nazis pass, turns to Mark Ratner, who is still
wearing his Cinema Four jacket.

			DAMONE 
	The business is changing, Rat. I'll
	tell you, these kids today... they
	don't even listen to Aerosmith.

			THE RAT 
	I hear they all dress like that at
	Lincoln now.

			DAMONE 
	There used to be three or four of
	those guys. Now we see 'em every
	time we come to the mall.

Damone is approached by a couple of young ticket
Customers.

			CUSTOMER #1 
	Got any Blue Oyster Cult tickets?

			DAMONE 
	No Cult. I ate twenty-four pairs of
	Blue Oyster Cult tickets last time
	around. I was this close to working
	at 7-11. No Cult.

Suddenly we see all ticket business stop. Damone
and his customers see someone menacingly coming
directly for them. The small crowd parts as Charles
Jefferson, football duffel bag in hand, walks up.
With him is a thick, tough, miniature version of
himself. This is Little Charles. They both stop in
front of Damone.

INT. CARL'S JR. BATHROOM - MORNING

Inside the bathroom, Brad Hamilton applies the
Carl's scrub brush to a felt tip graffiti message
near the mirror: I EAT BIG HAIRY PUSSY. He pauses
and catches himself in the mirror. He adjusts his
hair.

			BRAD 
	(talking to mirror) 
	Lisa? I have something to tell you.
	Look, I'm a senior now.
	I'm a single, successful guy and
	I've got to be fair to myself.
	Lisa... I think I need my freedom.

Brad is joined by Dennis Taylor, the Assistant
Manager.

	Come on. Clean that counter off
	Brad. Let's go. Play ball.

			BRAD 
	Okay, Dennis.

Brad begins polishing the counter and Dennis Taylor
returns to his office at the back of the kitchen.

Brad watches him disappear behind the door that
says: ASSISTANT MANAGER.

As soon as Dennis disappears behind the door, the
one Businessman in the place rises and returns to

same packs of kids roaming the three tiers.

ANGLE ON MARK RATNER

who stands against the railing in his Cinema Four
jacket, gazing across the mall at Swenson's Ice
Cream Parlor. He sees Stacy walk two girlfriends to
the outdoor front tables, and almost look his way.
The Rat turns away suddenly. Then he hears her
calling out after him.

			STACY 
	Hey Mark! Turn around!

Ratner turns around, affects total and complete
cool. He waves across the mall to her.

			STACY (CONT'D)
	Come over here!

He looks back at his post at the theatre, decides
it's okay to step away. He walks across the mall.

INT. SWENSON'S

Stacy is standing by the sundae bar. Next to her
are two empty stools. After a moment, we see The
Rat plop onto one of the metal stools. He pounds
the seat next to him with the palm of his hand.

INT. LOBBY - DIOGENES CLUB - DAY

Dominating the lobby is a large statue of Queen Victoria.
Presiding over the reception desk is a uniformed PORTER
of military bearing, with one arm and a chest full of
campaign ribbons. Holmes and Watson stride in.

                       HOLMES
                 (to porter)
          To see Mr. Mycroft Holmes.

                        PORTER
          Right you are. He's expecting you in the
          upstairs study. Now if you gentlemen
          will sign in --

          of business --

He holds out the pen to them, but they are gone. He
looks around in consternation, sees them hurrying up the
majestic staircase, steps out from behind his desk.

                       PORTER
          Gentlemen...!


READING ROOM - DIOGENES CLUB - DAY

about as lively.

A dozen elderly Establishment types are sunk deep in the
leather armchairs, buried behind their copies of The
Times.  Holmes and Watson are proceeding toward the
study.  Suddenly Holmes stops beside one of the old
fossils, who has fallen asleep in his chair, The Times in
his lap, and between his fingers a lighted cigar with an
ash four inches long. Holmes picks up an ashtray, holds
it under the cigar -- just in time to catch the falling
ash. As  he replaces the ashtray, he scrutinizes the ash.

Algren and Gant are led into an elegant room with paper screens, and a table
set for the Japanese tea ceremony.                                               .

gesturing for him to sit The other begins the tea ceremony.

                            No tea... Sake.

A musician plays a traditional lute. The geisha begins a graceful fan dance.

                            Fan dance. Saw this once in Chicago.

Algren smiles at the Geisha preparing the. She smiles back. Algren pours
himself a cup of sake.

Later...

The sake bottle is empty. The interminable lute music continues.

Gant is increasingly agitated as the geisha continues her dance. Algren can't
help but laugh at his frustration. Finally Gant has had enough. He rises, a
bit unsteady from the sake.

                                              GANT
                            Okay, darlin' time to get down to business:

He shoos the musician out of the room, then approaches the geisha, who
shrinks from his intention.

                            have got in our trousers, eh, darlin'?

He takes her arm. She resists - her voice rising.

                            Come on, now.

He tries to pull her along. Her kimono tears. She calls out in terror. Two men

appear, bouncers presumably, but alight of build.

                          convinced to accept the emperor's rule.

They pass a particularly wrenching sight. Villagers kneeling outside what
used to be a Shinto temple. The railroad tracks cut straight through it.

Villagers laugh as they go about the business of life. A man throws a sack of rice to another. Two women hurry

Algren is once again among the training warriors. He and another man face off, each waiting for the other to
attack with his wooden sword.

Algren moves first, but his opponent counters, and strikes him easily. They wheel around and engage again,
and again Algren is bested. Furious, he throws himself at his opponent, reverting to classic saber technique.

In a flurry of movement, his opponent manages to deflect the blows and also knock Algren to his knees.
Yoritomo approaches and bows.

You see my instrument there? First notch represents two dollars and fifty
cents. That's how much I got for my first kill. There are forty-eight more
notches after it, and my fee has grown with each one. I can accommodate
you alright, but you got to afford me. So do business with me or do it on
your own.

          Kid, this is the United States

INT.  MABEL'S DINER - DAY

Lardner comes over to Mabel, who hands him a tall paper cup
of coffee and bags him a bear claw.

                    LARDNER
          Mornin' Mabel, Stan.

                    MABEL
          Mornin' Doc.  Got some new business
          for you today.

Lardner and Pete make eye contact, and the doctor notices the
bump on his head.

                    LARDNER
          Hello, son.  How'd that happen?

                    STANTON
          He don't know.  And he don't know
          his name, neither.  Found him down
          by the wash.

                    LARDNER
          You'd better come with me, son.
              (to Mabel, indicating the
               coffee and danish)
          On my tab?

                    MABEL
          You bet.

Lardner, Stanton and Pete rise and move to the door.  Pete
turns back, takes the three quarters out of his pocket, and
puts them on the counter, smiling brightly at Mabel.

          And... what's my name again?

          Albert Lucas Trumbo.  But you've

          Ah.

Luke looks at the town as they drive down Commerce Street.

          How long?

Pause.  The silence is too thick, and Harry has to answer. 
He turns around in his seat and faces Luke.

                    HARRY
              (gently)
          You never came back from the war. 
          We were told you were missing and
          presumed dead.

          television set working.

                    LARDNER
          I had it, a minute ago...

He glances at the TV set.  The picture is suddenly crystal
clear.

                    LARDNER
          ... ooooh, It's back.
              (encouraging them toward
               the door)
          Well, you kids have fun now...

Adele takes Luke's arm and they exit, exchanging goodnights
with Lardner, who closes the door and turns toward the living
room.

S-l-o-w-l-y, he sneaks into the room, watching the TV
carefully all the while.  The reception is staying perfect. 
Caesar and Coca are involved in an intricate bit of business,
and Lardner wants to laugh, but he's afraid to.  He stifles
his urge, and heads for his chair.  Gingerly, he sits.  Still
perfect.

Satisfied, he finally LAUGHS out loud and puts his feet up. 
The picture goes completely haywire again.

                    LARDNER
          Aw, crap.

Adele and Luke walk along, arm-in-arm.

          prepared, and if you'd like to

                         today, they're just slaves to fashion.

               We glide over the tightly packed hangers, close enough to

               the racks of high heels.

               We slide along the delicate taper of a stiletto heel and 
               reach the bottom of the closet, where we find a pair of black 
               Dr. Martens boots that are tied together with a white rope.

               We move up the boots and we see it is a woman who is bound, 
               lying motionless on the floor of the closet, the rope coiling 
               tightly around her wrists.

               The crack at the bottom of the door lights her face.  She is 
               gagged and unconscious, a trickle of blood running down her 
               forehead.  Her name is CORKY.

          Fellas. I hear ya. I really do. And
          I appreciate the honesty. That
          can't be easy. No Sir. You got
          grievances. You got your own selves

    SIR CHRISTOPHER HATTON, 30s, an ambitious courtier; LORD

     She goes on to the steps at the foot of the altar, and
     kneels to pray. As she kneels she holds out one hand behind
     her, not looking round. Bess steps forward, and taking her
     hand, kneels and prays with her.

     A man who looks like a shop assistant sits grabbing a quick
     lunch. He's the TORTURER. Nearby on a blood-stained bench
     lies a huddled half-naked figure, trembling uncontrollably.
     It's Francis Throckmorton. He's neither manacled nor
     guarded. His body is so broken it's not necessary.

     Walsingham enters. The torturer jumps to his feet.
     Walsingham goes to Throckmorton. He gazes at him, shaking
     his head. He's getting too old for this dirty business.

                         WALSINGHAM

But Elizabeth is too far gone. She turns on him, eyes
blazing.

                    ELIZABETH
          This is no time for mercy! That's
          what you said to me. I don't
          forget. But you showed mercy,
          Walsingham! Go to your traitor
          brother, and leave me to my
          business!

          Is the child his? Tell me! Say
          it! Is it his?

Bess responds to the Queen's hysteria with dignity.

          Yes, my lady. It is - my
          husband's child.

Her gaze reaches beyond the Queen. Elizabeth turns.

INT.  D'ARTAGNAN'S ROOM - NIGHT

D'Artagnan returns from his ride to Athos' place.  He looks
down at the Queen's door.  He checks the clock on the wall;
it is a few minutes past nine.  He enters his room, moves to
the window, and waits there, to catch a glimpse of her.

INT.  COUNTRY MANOR HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - NIGHT

Aramis is digging into a hearty meal, while Porthos only
stares at his plate.

                     ARAMIS
          See?  There is plenty of food in the
          country.  But the King keeps it
          going to the army instead of --

Athos marches in, all business.

                     ATHOS
          He is sleeping.  Now see here,
          Aramis, it's time you told us --

He breaks off as a voluptuous serving girl leans over to
spoon food onto Porthos' plate; her breasts jiggle below his
nose, and she gives him a smile.

                     PORTHOS
          I have no appetite for food, I am
          wasting away.  Say goodbye to
          Porthos, for he is gone.  Even women
          don't interest me now.

The girl moves to whisper with two other serving girls, who
seem fascinated with the roguish Porthos; their giggles and
winks make Porthos even more morose; he tells his friends...

                     PORTHOS
          I tell you a secret.  I sleep with
          three women at once, not because my
          appetite is so great, but because
          now it take three to excite me.

Porthos heaves himself to his feet and shuffles off; Aramis
sighs, having heard all this before.  Athos sits down.

                     ATHOS
          Who is he, Aramis?

          I suppose... it is to remember there
          are many people who have never been
          in a prison, who pass such beauty
          every day, and never see it.

Phillippe reaches to a flower, plucks it, and smells it.  He
looks around at the beauty of the garden, taking it all in.
Athos looks around too; then Athos realizes Phillippe is no
longer looking at the garden, but at him.

                     PHILLIPPE
          You look so sad.  Is it something I
          have done?

                     ATHOS
          It is something I have done -- or
          did not do.

                     PHILLIPPE
          What is that?

                     ATHOS
          I did not share beauty with
          someone... who is no longer here for
          me to share beauty with.

Before Phillippe can pursue this, Athos turns businesslike.

                     ATHOS
          We have much to do, we'd best get
          started.  Now suppose you were to
          walk into a garden, as a king...

INT.  MANOR HOUSE DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Aramis is having dinner; he calls toward the kitchen.

Athos enters and sags into a chair, his energy spent.

Dunbar raises his rifle and SHOOTS NUNEZ. He goes down,

          The snow's driving just as hard out here, but peaceful houses
          with warm windows glowing make the storm feel comforting. In
          the yards, forgotten sleds disappear under new powder, gone
          for good by morning. Snowmen distort as they swell.
          
          Max Payne trudges up the center of the street, a black streak
          spoiling the peace of the evening. A trespasser.

                         That's tough. In most cases involving 
                         a child that young, the court tends 
                         to side with the mother.

               Bob's black Presidential (looks like a 60's diplomat's car) 
               pulls up at the entrance of the Park Hyatt, a modern sky 
               rise.

               The automatic doors open on the car, as Bob gets out.   Eager 
               BELLHOPS with white gloves approach at the sight of the car, 
               welcoming Bob and helping him with his bags.

               Bob stands in the back of a crowded elevator surrounded by 
               Japanese businessmen below his shoulders.

               The elevator stops at the 50th floor and the doors open onto

               the massive, streamline lobby of the Park Hyatt.

               Bob follows the JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN out into the marble and 
               glass lobby that frames the view of Tokyo.

               The CONCIERGE and several eager HOTEL MANAGERS greet Bob. He 
               just wants to sleep, but more STAFF continue to greet him, 
               ask him about his fright. They lead him to reception.

               At the reception area four JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN and two WOMEN 
               quickly sit up from their seats on sight of Bob, and extend 
               handshakes and gifts. They bow and introduce themselves from 
               the commercial company, extend name cards and welcome him 
               enthusiastically.

               More staff welcomes him and offer their service during his

               up, and ask if he needs anything else.

               Some JAPANESE ROCK STARS with shag haircuts and skinny leather

               Thrill is Gone" over the stereo.

               We see Bob's POV of tables of people talking. JAPANESE WOMEN 
               SMOKING, AMERICAN BUSINESSMEN tying one on, talking about 
               software sales. A WAITER carefully setting down a coaster, 
               and pouring a beer very, very slowly. It's all very foreign.

               Bob gets in the shower overlooking the view of Tokyo. The 
               shower head is at his elbows, he raises it as high as it 
               goes, and leans down to have a shower. This hotel was not

          Not that it's any of your
          goddamned business, but when
          things happen quickly like that,
          you have to react. In Korea, we

          FATHER JANOVICH
          I've been thinking about our
          discussion on life and death.
          About what you said. About how
          you carry around the horrible
          things you were forced to do.
          Horrible things that won't leave
          you. It seems that it would do
          you good to unload some of that
          burden. Things done during war
          are terrible, being ordered to
          kill, killing to save others,
          killing to save yourself. You're
          right, those are things I don't
          know anything about. But I do
          know about forgiveness. And I've
          seen a lot of men who have
          confessed their sins, admitted
          their guilt and left their burdens
          behind them. Stronger men than
          you. Men at war who were ordered
          to do appalling things and are now
          at peace.
          Walt nods. Father Janovich threw a bull's-eye. Almost.

          I'm impressed. You came with your
          guns loaded, for once.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          Thank you.

                   Yeah, I'm sorry too... you have
                   to get out of this business... I

                   Everything can be fixed... always.

      Then Hector's girl friend ANNA arrives in her car. It is
      a bright pink station wagon, highly decorated with flower
      motifs and slogans like "ANNA'S ARRANGEMENTS," and "FRESH
      OR DRY, WE'LL PLEASE THE EYE." Anna is a florist.
      Hector brightens when he sees her. Everything is falling
      into place. All he has to do now is cross two rivers
      and Manhatan Island in under an hour, in Anna's pink car.
      He runs to meet her.
                                 ANNA
                   Get in... you can dropp me at the

      Hector gets into the car, smiling broadly.

                   button industry... we had gone
                   from making forty thousand buttons
                   a day to making two hundred and
                   fifty thousand... We employed ten

swinging wildly. Jim Byrd, a middle-aged, business man-

out of the bar. Byrd takes a sip of his drink.

          Kind of a loner, I'd say. Fairly bright.
          A tad anti-social. Mad at the world.

          I'm telling ya. And... And sometimes you
          can be the chaperone, Chuckie. Let's say
          we have a job for you in Austria. You, a
          successful tv producer, above suspicion,
          chaperones the young couple, and while
          you're there, blam! you take care of some

          needing the money. Some of it, but very
          little. You liked it with Renda, Chuck.
          I saw it in your eyes. You liked it but
          you botched it. Don't you want to get
          really good at something, Chuck?

INT. BOOTH (DATING GAME SHOW) - DAY

The director calls the shots. Barris stands in the back
watching the show in progress. On the stage is a pretty
blonde bachelorette in a short black dress and three
bachelors. Bachelors two and three are attractive and
stylishly dressed and groomed. Bachelor one is a fat, not-
too-bright looking guy in a yellow-ochre leisure suit. His
slow, unfocused delivery contrasts with the fast, sharp
chatter in the booth.

          Oh, and your father the dentist? Not

          father was a man named Edmund James
          Windsor. A serial killer. A fact your
          mother didn't know when she had an affair
          with him in 1930. If you want to look
          him up, he was also known as the
          Tarrytown Troll, because he had been
          described by witnesses as short and ugly.
          Windsor died in the electrical chair at
          Ossining in 1939. We believed your self-
          loathing tendencies coupled with that

                         No, your business is to smile, make 
                         friends, and get rich! My business 
                         is the business.

     Look, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but
     there's no need to take it out on us.

                                    TOMMY

     Doesn't it make you proud to be Scottish?

                                   RENTON

     I hate being Scottish. We're the lowest of the fucking low, the
     scum of the earth, the most wretched, servile, miserable, pathetic
     trash that was ever shat into civilization. Some people hate the
     English, but I don't. They're just wankers. We, on the other hand,
     are colonized by wankers. We can't even pick a decent culture to
     be colonized by. We are ruled by effete arseholes. It's a shite
     state of affairs and all the fresh air in the world will not make
     any fucking difference.

The three serious Walkers are receding into the distance.
The boys troop back towards the platform.
                                    (v.o)
At or around this time, we made a healthy, informed, democratic decision to

     It looks easy, this, but it's not. It looks like a doss, like a
     soft option, but living like this, it's a full-time business.

     Lizzy's gone, Mark, she's gone and fucking dumped me. It was the
     video tape and that Iggy Pop business and all sorts of other
     stuff. She told me where to go and no mistake. I said, is there
     any chance of getting back together, like, but no way, no fucking
     way.

Renton and Tommy slumped side by side as before.
                                    TOMMY

     I want to try it, Mark. You're always going on about how it's the
     ultimate hit and that. Better than sex. Come on, I'm a fucking
     adult. I want to find out for myself.

the lapel.

     Now, listen to me, you little piece of junky shit. A joke's a

     that was one day going to make him rich.

               framed one-sheets for tacky public access shows (Yoga, blow-
               dried Evangelist, Nude Talk Show). Behind the reception desk 
               sits a beefy RENT-A-GUARD with an earring.

                                     RENT-A-GUARD
                         Help you?

     EXT. SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS

     Jack hesitates, unsure, then run/walks to catch up to her...

                             JACK
                 Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange
                 numbers?

                             MARLA
                 Should we?

                             JACK
                 In case we want to switch nights.

                             MARLA
                 I suppose.

     Jack takes out a business card, writes his number on the
     back, hands it to her.  She takes the pen, grabs his hand
     and writes her number on his palm.  She walks into the
     street, causing more SCREECHING and HONKING.  She turns,
     holds up the card.

                             MARLA
                 It doesn't have your name.  Who are
                 you?  Cornelius?  Mr. Taylor?  Dr.
                 Zaius?  Any of the stupid names you
                 give each night?

     Jack starts to answer, but the traffic noise is too loud.
     Marla just shakes her head, turns, and keeps moving.  A BUS
     moves into view, obscuring her.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 This is how I met Marla Singer.

                 and in a different place, could you

     Jack sits next to a BUSINESSMAN.  As they have idle

     Jack picks up an individual, wrapped Q-TIP, looks at it.  He
     moves out of the bathroom into...

     MAIN ROOM

     Jack sits on the bed.  He turns on the TV.  It's tuned to
     the "Sheraton Channel," shows WAITERS serving people in a
     large BANQUET ROOM.  Jack stops brushing his teeth, feels
     something on the bed, lifts it -- a small DINNER MINT.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - IN FLIGHT - NIGHT

     Jack sits next to a frumpy WOMAN.  They chat.  Jack turns to
     look at his food, takes a bite.  He turns back and it's...

     --a BALD MAN next to him, talking.  Jack takes another bite,
     turns back and it's...

     --a BUSINESSMAN next to him.  Jack takes another bite, turns
     back, and it's...

     --a BUSINESS WOMAN next to him.

                 Between take-off and landing, we have

     Turgid silence.  Jack turns to the window.  He sees a
     PELICAN get SUCKED into the TURBINE.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Every time the plane banked too
                 sharply on take-off or landing, I
                 prayed for a crash, or a mid-air
                 collision -- anything.

     Jack's face remains bland during the following: the plane
     BUCKLES -- the cabin wobbles.  People panic.  Masks drop.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 No more haircuts.  Nothing matters,
                 not even bad breath.

     The side of the plane SHEARS OFF!  Screaming PASSENGERS are
     sucked out into the night air, flying past the quivering
     wind.  Magazines and other objects fly everywhere.

     Jack replaces the receiver.  He pockets Marla's number, digs
     out a small FILOFAX.  He flips through the pages for phone
     numbers and addresses.  Most of the pages are blank.

                 If you asked me now, I couldn't tell
                 you why I called him.

     Jack re-deposits the quarter, dials Tyler's number.  It
     RINGS... and RINGS and RINGS.  Jack sighs and hangs up the
     phone.  A moment, then the phone RINGS.

          There's a BUSINESS WOMAN waiting in the regular line. Ryan
          walks right past her and gets into the ELITE LINE. They are
          now both first in their respective lines for the counter.
                         
          The woman looks over at Ryan and sighs. Natalie holds back,
          confused by Ryan's actions and wanting to avoid confrontation.
                         
          The DESK CLERK frees up and gestures for Ryan to step
          forward. Ryan begins wheeling his bag forward. Meanwhile, the
          woman lifts her hand in outrage.

     She is a bundle of activity -- serving pies, collecting

The painting is a horrible mess. Out of the violence of the
pattern a man's face can be discerned, wild-eyed and
distorted. We hear laughter from Bruno.


BACK TO SCENE

Bruno's roar of laughter puzzles Mrs. Anthony, but she is
pleased to hear his good humor. He puts an arm around her.

                      BRUNO
          You're wonderful, Ma! It's the old

          It is? I was trying to paint Saint
          Francis.

At this moment there is the sound of the front door opening.
Then immediately the telephone bell rings in the hall. Bruno
is instantly alert, as if he had been expecting a call. He
goes toward the door to the hall, as the butler enters.

              (to Bruno)
          They are ready with your call to
          Southampton, Sir.

Bruno's father MR. ANTHONY, purposefully enters the living
room. He an impeccably dressed business man with an
uncompromising eye. His entrance momentarily blocks Bruno's
exit.

                      MRS. ANTHONY
              (to her husband)
          How nice that you're early, Charles.
          I'll tell cook....

Bruno now exits into the hall, passing his father without
speaking.

                      MR. ANTHONY
          Just a minute, Eunice.

Slowly Guy's eyes meet hers. They are remembering what he
said on the phone: "I could strangle her." He sinks into a
chair. The Senator is quite distressed.

During the following scene Barbara quietly goes about the
business of pouring drinks and serving them. She knows

          He's a senator.

          It can't be helped, darling. It is
          not your fault. It's not as though
          anyone can say you had something to
          do with it.

          Someone might say it...I'd do anything
          to keep you all out of this mess.

          Profit by my experience, Guy. Never
          lose any sleep over accusations.
              (an afterthought)
          Unless they can be proved, of course.
          We'll help all we can. Dreadful
          business, dreadful. That poor
          unfortunate girl.

          Business.  Turning into regular
          Tycoons.  Gonna call this one the

          Name.

          So tell me, Wyatt.  I'm curious.
          Do you actually consider youself
          A married man?  Forsaking all
          Others?

          Curly Bill.  He's over across the

          This is great, this is just great.

Just then Behan dashes in, white as a sheet, Josephine in tow:

          Have you been out in the street?
          Somebody's got to do something.

          You're the Sheriff.

          It's not County business, it's a 
          Town matter.

Outside Curly Bill starts taking potshots at a passerby's 
feet, making him dance down the street and scurry for cover.  
Curly Bill cackles.  Inside White turns uneasily to Wyatt:

                     WYATT
          Why don't you just leave it alone?

          None of my business, Fred.

Wyatt keeps dealing, Doc keeps playing.  White draws himself 
up and exits.  Outside, Curly Bill reloads and keeps shooting.  
White steps out into the street.  We feel a sense of inverted 
terror as he draws his gun and we SEE that his hand is 
trembling.  He crosses the street, coming up behind Curly 
Bill:

                     WHITE
          Hey, Curly?  Come on now, boy...

Curly Bill spins around.  White's gun stares him in the face.

habit, riding side-saddle through the cut on a pretty mare.

Looking for an escape, Wyatt turns up a narrow trail on the 
side of the cut.  He follows it as it winds around the hill 
then abruptly drops back down and comes out on the other side 
of the cut right in front of Josephine.  She waves.  He 
groans:

           off the motor and let's them drift. Neckbone folds the
           letter back up and turns to face Ellis.

     "10-16-99."

     Sure enough, O'Ryan had circled "Riverside, Ca." on this map.
     Next to it he'd written "10-16."

     Mackelway sticks a yellow pin in Riverside.

     Next, the fax concerning "Anna Casitas, Age 22." Last Seen?
     "Macon, Ga." on "5-6-00."

     Of course, O'Ryan had circled "Macon" too. Beside it he'd
     written "5-6." So Macon gets a yellow pin.

                                                         38.


Mackelway continues, as:

                     FRAN (O.S.)
           Got nothing on the last fax.

Mackelway turns. In comes Fran.

                     FRAN (CONT'D)
           Came from a business center at a Mariott
           in Dallas. Nobody saw who sent it.

Mackelway nods. Then they both turn... Charlton enters the
room.

                     CHARLTON
           Whadda we know about the map?

                      MACKELWAY
           It matches the faxes, Sir. Almost
           perfectly.

Charlton approaches the map: 1,242 cities, circled in red.
Mackelway continues with the yellow pins: one for every HAVE
YOU SEEN ME? (45 of them so far.)

Charlton eyes the stack. 45 HAVE YOU SEEN ME's... Then the
map: 1,242 cities. Each with a DATE beside it.

                     CHARLTON
           Why's Greenville in blue?

(Mackelway has put a yellow pin beside a dozen cities... but
tiny Greenville, Texas has a BLUE PIN beside it.)

                     MACKELWAY
           Only city where the date on the fax and

     We've been to this house before. Suburbia.

     Mackelway sits in his car, at the curb, studying the place.
     Rain falls in sheets, wind blows. And there he is, all alone,
     six in the morning, staring at a house.

     That idea - the thought that snapped his eyes open - it's
     still working on him. Beside him is the DRAWING that was found
     in Speck's car:

     The rendering of a steamer-trunk, lined with plastic,
     containing body parts in plastic bags... Mackelway seems to be
     fixated on it now.

     A hand knocks on the front door. Jan Speck opens up.

                          JAN
                    (hoping for good news:)
                Agent Mackelway?

     Mackelway stands in the doorway, rain falling behind him.

                    (all business)

     Mackelway sits at the WINDOW, looking over the backyard.
     Nothing special out here: some trees, a swing, a storm-cellar
     door.

     But he's staring at it, intently. We're not sure why.

                                                         56.

in hand. She grabs his cup of coffee and saucer from the

           Huh?

                     O'RYAN
           I could hear her moaning, right under the
           Navajo chanting. Whole thing was
           downright tribal. What's she look like?

That was unsettling. Very. Mackelway looks around feeling
violated, feeling "watched." He draws the blinds. Double bolts
the front door. Runs his hand under the window frame for any
kind of wire tapping.

But Mackelway won't allow himself to over-react. Not now, with
O'Ryan on the phone.

                     MACKELWAY
               (calmly)
           You tell me.

O'Ryan laughs. He liked that.

                     O'RYAN
           Fair enough. We'll stick to business:
           How'd ya like my old room?

           Huh?

           "Hope House." You were there.

How the hell did he know that? It's unsettling.

	passes the hardware store, the gas station, the bakery ...
	Finally he pauses outside the barbershop. It's empty as well
	with the spinning barber pole being buffeted by the rain.
	George lowers his arms and just stares into the darkened

	The regular occupants of the barber shop spread out across
	three lanes. Each wears a Pleasantville bowling shirt,
	sponsored by one of Big Bob's businesses.

	The NOISE from the crashing pins is deafening and there
	aren't any windows so the storm has gone unnoticed ...

          do at this moment Don't they have

          You know, maybe I deserve it. I
          screwed up the only good thing that
          ever happened in my life. I
          cheated on you. For no reason at

          Maybe I over reacted. I didn't

          It's not like you weren't good
          before, but your act is so much
          more sophisticated, but just as
          funny. I've never seen you speak
          so honestly on stage before. You
          used to say these goofy jokes. It
          was really something, you know, and
          you should be really proud of

             Okay. Are you going to my funeral
             when Martin Asher cuts my throat?
They both know she's been lowballing the threat. We can
tell Grace is truly concerned for Costa's welfare.

                           COSTA

             You let him get away.
Grace takes that hard.

                            GRACE

             No excuses.   I'm sorry.

                           COSTA

             I meant you in the general sense.
                     (a beat)
             Can you catch him?

Costa licks his lips.




                           COSTA

             That would be out of bounds.
Grace looking at him. Costa looking at her. A staring
match. Costa and Grace try not to laugh. They end up
giggling.

                           COSTA

             What was that?

                           GRACE

             I don't know. John, games are

             dangerous.

                           COSTA

             Then keep your head out of it.
A beat.   Grace shrugs, back to business.

             I don't know what your deal is.
             One second you're so there, then
             all I get is the badge.

Grace smiles, plays along, crosses, looks under the bed,
stretching for Costa. Driving him nuts.

                         could add a second floor and put our

               Carl laughs as he looks at Sam. Their bodies, covered with 
               white powder, appear as strange, ghostly figures.

                         Hey, Sam, turn around.

               Sam obeys. Molly doodles on his chest, drawing a bow tie and 
               the outline of a tuxedo jacket. Her lines are quick, 
               accomplished, and subtly erotic.

               Molly nods. She reaches out and superimposes an armless female 
               torso over his. His stomach jumps sensually as she touches 
               it. Molly pulls back to admire her work. He looks like a

		Oh, I don't want him to quit. He

		He's got his ledgers out, and he's

		television or something, and he'll 
		come over, and he'll start telling

                         Mr. Dietrichson would understand. 
                         I'm sure I could sell him on the 
                         idea of some accident protection. 
                         Why don't I talk to him about it.

                                     PHYLLIS
                         You could try. But he's pretty tough 
                         going.

                         He's got a lot on his mind. He doesn't 
                         want to listen to anything except 
                         maybe a baseball game on the radio.

                         Why not? But that wasn't the only 
                         reason. I was his wife's nurse. She 
                         was sick for a long time. When she 
                         died, he was all broken up. I pitied

                         Every-time I buy a dress or a pair 
                         of shoes he yells his head off. He 
                         won't let me go anywhere. He keeps 
                         me shut up. He's always been mean to 
                         me. Even his life insurance all goes 
                         to that daughter of his. That Lola.

                         hesitated before asking you to come

               Phyllis nods silently.

                         But now that you're here I hope you 
                         won't mind if I plunge straight into

               has hung his hat on his foot and thrust his thumbs in the

          I mean, if it was my money I'd put
          it in a bank out of town so
          everyone didn't know my business.
          This bank here, you can't trust,
          that's all I'm saying.

           Using a tool, Buddy unseals the casket to put the new money
           in it and discovers that the rest of the money is gone? He
           can't believe it. He yanks back the casket bed lining..

          Bush is sanding the beautiful lid of his casket. It is
          leaning against the wall and sawdust is drifting down all
          over him. He suddenly stops, rubs the wood tenderly, muscles
          up the heavy top to put it on the box and staggers back. It's
          not the weight, something is wrong. Sweat pops out on his
          forehead. He forces himself to the casket and drops the top
          down hard, staggers back against the loft ladder, slides down
          to the ground, and stares at the casket. Is this it?

                    Are you really surprised? Jacqueline
                    is a lot younger than Miranda. Has a
                    fresher take on things. Not to mention
                    that American Runway is one of the
                    most expensive books in the business.
                    Jacqueline does the same thing with a

     Shred it. Grab another file. Hyper-detailed: subscript
     clarifications, attachments, pictures, procedural notes to
     the U.S.A.W.N.: United States Attorney Welles Noonan.

     Then I see the tab of the file furthest down: BOYCE BRADLEY.
     Open it: Noonan's business card stapled to the front cover.
     Flip forward. Scan. See Bradley's name, finger tracks across
     a page. A company name: `HURWITZ HOLDINGS'

     I read it all...and feel my jaw slowly unhinge...


89   INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - MORNING                           89

     Barrel down the hallway toward Bradley's office. A habitual
     eye toward Junior's desk: Koenig going through his drawers.
     Stop. Veer toward him...

     Teeth grit. Hide it. Let Koenig talk.

                         KOENIG (CONT'D)
               Heavily inebriated. Speaking
               inarticulately of `betrayal,' &amp; how
               the LAPD was set to be `blitzed by
               justice.' Is this the `bind' of
               which we spoke earlier?

          That's why you wanted Tommy found,
          not because he was a murder suspect
          or you were concerned that Noonan
          might tap him as a federal
          witness...you needed him to
          finalize your fucking land grab. To
          sign paperwork in place of his dead
          Dad. That's why you've got Madge
          and Lucille in custody now.
              (beat)
          Maybe I'll let your subpoena find
          me now Chief, maybe I'll walk right
          into it...the tales I could tell.

All Bradley can muster is:

                    BRADLEY
          How?

                    ME
          Junior Stemmons. The ex-evidence
          teacher. His `excellent ratings'
          didn't stop him from stealing the
          Magdalena seizure and doing his own
          investigation.

                    BRADLEY
          Why would he investigate me?

Hand him Noonan's business card: dig the big Federal Eagle in
American Blue.

                     ME
          That was stapled to the cover.
              (beat)
          Why would Noonan worry about a Turd
          like me now...when a high profile
          target like you can be taken down.

Silence. I smile wide at it. Bradley, scrambling.

                    BRADLEY
          Where is Stemmons?

                    ME
          No idea. If you haven't spoken to
          Internal Affairs today, I'm sure
          they've called. Junior's apartment
          caught fire. Deeply deviant
          material inside. Round him up-
              (my angle)
          -and anyone he's got with him.

Bradley readjusts his glasses.

          So you get this file to battle
          Bradley with. What's Junior get in

And like he was waiting for those words: Junior lunges. I
twist to deflect but he's too fast -- feel something sink and
drag in my side. I go down, gouge/groping for my gun. Instant
trauma zaps nerves numb up the arm, fingers failing. Then a
pain like boiling oil moves through my blood.

                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
          JUST YOU! YOU FUCK!

Look down, SEE: A mother-of-pearl knife hilt in my side, the
business end stuck deep. Junior laughing as I fall to my
knees. He pulls the file from the waist and tosses my .45.

     EXT.  OLD HOUSE -- DAY

     Birds sing.  Somerset stands, pondering the forested landscape.

                                 MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                   Is something wrong?

     Somerset does not respond. The MAN, in an ill-fitting real
     estate jacket, is seated on the hood of a dirty Ford
     Thunderbird.  He holds a check and a booklet of receipts.

                                 MAN (CONT)
                   Is something the matter?

                   No... no.  There's nothing wrong.

     Somerset still seems distant.

                           (writes receipt)
                   Not that it's any of my business... but,
                   are you figuring on moving out here
                   eventually?

                   I just never seen a man mortgaging an
                   empty house before.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Everything here still seems... seems so
                   strange to me.  All this.

                   I don't know.  I'd say this place is
                   about as normal as places get.

     The man walks over to hand over a receipt.  Somerset accepts the
     receipt, folds it.  Somerset smiles.

     takes a photocopy of the photo of the falsely pretty woman and
     hands it to Somerset.

                   She was away on business.  She got back

		Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton,

follow him to the large boathouse where Michael conducts his

starts a vamp, the drums uncertainly join in.  A clarinet
starts to play "Pop Goes the Weasel," and soon the rest of

INT. MICHAEL-KAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The room is lit from a small night lamp on Michael's side of
the large bed.

Kay is huddled in blankets, asleep.  Michael closes the door
to his room, moves to his side of the bed, and glances down
to the pillow.

VIEW ON THE PILLOW

is a child's drawing of a long limousine, with a man in a
hat sitting in the back seat.

An arrow pointing to him is marked "DAD." Under it, a nine
year old's handwriting says: "Do you like it?  Check YES __
I liked it or NO __ I didn't like it." Michael turns,
looking for a pencil, and moves to the dresser, where he
places a check next to "YES."

He starts to cross back toward his side of the bed, when Kay
turns, almost in her sleep:

EXT. TAHOE ESTATE - HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT

Michael walks the short distance from his house, to the
boathouse where he conducts his business away from his family.

A small group of bodyguards, carrying machine guns, make the
walk with him from all sides, a respectful distance away.
It gives the appearance of a lonely President moving in his
compound, followed by teams of Secret Service men.

The boathouse is already secured by teams of men, hastily
wakened from their lodge house; a barracks-like structure
where reinforcements are lodged just for this kind of
emergency.

FULL VIEW

In the distance, we can see the teams of men and dogs, with
their lights, guns and shouts, combing every inch of the
estate.

INT. THE BOATHOUSE - EMPTY VIEW - NIGHT

Michael alone in the great room.  He moves to a walk-in
safe, quickly runs through the combination, and opens it.
He takes out an envelope, and puts it into his pocket;
there's a KNOCK on the door, and Hagen enters.  He had been
asleep, and has quickly thrown on a robe.

				MICHAEL
		Sit down, Tom.

EXT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - NIGHT

From outside the leaded windows, a disoriented Hagen sits
down; Michael starts to talk to him; obviously about

Michael says something to Tom, who rises, and pulls the
drapes, obscuring OUR VIEW.

Michael continues up to a small den on the second floor; we
can HEAR the sound of a baseball game coming over the
television.

INT. HYMAN ROTH'S DEN - DAY

Michael enters the den: it's very comfortable, but somewhat
like a senior citizen's retirement home in Florida.

MICHAEL'S VIEW

There, sitting before the television is a small man in his
middle sixties, thin, with a wizened face, looking like a
small-time retired Jewish businessman.  This is HYMAN ROTH.

				ROTH
		Sit down, this is almost over.  You

		Not for a few years.

This hurts Tom; but he is a reasonable man, and he knows he
owes Neri some explanation.

		You've been through a lot with us

EXT. KEY WEST - NIGHT

Michael is led to a desolate, night-lit private dock.  He is
followed by the ever-present Bussetta, and they are helped
onto a light-weight, luxury cabin cruiser.  The crew cast
off various ropes, and the boat sets out into the night.

							FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

		It means... "The Lie."

A moment's hesitation, then a few of the men laugh.  Now two
Cubans in white carry a table which has a lovely small cake
on it.

				SAM ROTH
		The cake is here.

They all raise their glasses to the old man.

Roth glances at the cake and its inscription, is pleased.

				ROTH
		I hope my age is correct: I am
		always accurate about my age.

Some laugh.  He nods, and they begin to cut it, put a piece
on plates, and carry them to the different men.

				ROTH
		Everything we've learned in Vegas
		is true here; but we can go further.
		The bigger, the swankier, the
		plusher the store, the more a sense
		of legitimacy, and the bigger
		business we do.
			(looking at the plate
			brought to him)
		A smaller piece.  What we've
		proposed to the Cuban Government is
		that it put up half the cash on a
		dollar for dollar basis.
			(accepting a smaller piece)
		Thank you.  We can find people in
		the United States who will put up
		our share for a small piece of the
		action, yet we will retain control.

				ONE OF THE MEN
		How much?

				ROTH
		A hundred million dollars.  But
		only if this Government relaxes its
		restrictions on importing building
		materials; we'll need some new
		laws, too, but that will be no
		difficulty.

				ANOTHER MAN
		What are import duties now?

				ROTH
		As much as seventy percent.  Also,
		I'm working out an arrangement with
		the Minister of Labor so that all
		our pit bosses, stick-men and
		Dealers, can be considered
		specialized technicians eligible
		for two year visas.  As of now
		they're only allowed in Cuba for
		six months at a time.  In short,
		we're in a full partnership with
		the Cuban Government.

INT. 'SUPERMAN SHOW' - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

A large room with a succession of platforms arranged step-
like around a circular area which becomes a stage.

There are a hundred or so people, practically all men,
tourists and business men, standing on the different levels,
forming the audience.

In the center of the stage is a thick, telephone type pole,
to which is tied a young Cuban girl, in a flimsy white
sacrificial slip.  A small band, mostly drummers, play some
Latin music.

MED. VIEW

Fredo's party standing on the ramp, looking down at the
spectacle.  They're a little woozy from the drinks and late
hour.  Michael is with them, but now we sense he is using
this time, with all exhausted and drunk, to come to some
important conclusions.

A full sitdown dinner is being served the guests.  Michael
sits at a table at dinner with several of the distinguished
Cubans, and some of the American businessmen.

				QUESTADT
		What's kept Mr. Roth?

Fredo looks up at Michael.

In the back of the room, we notice the detachment of military
moving quickly through the reception room on their way to
the President's private quarters.  Michael notices it as well.

INT. THE HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - FULL VIEW - NIGHT

The activity at the end of the hall has come to rest; we can
tell that the doctor tells Mrs. Roth that she should go, the
old man will be taken to a room where he can rest.
Gradually, these people leave him in the care of the hospital
staff.

Bussetta watches from the distance of the hallway; after the
old man has been moved, he quietly walks down the hallway to
the room.

HIS VIEW

A nurse sits in the room in attendance; Hyman Roth is
asleep, his mouth wide open, breathing noisily.

another room.

Some nurses and attendants speak to the nurse in the room in
Spanish; one has brought a small bottle of wine, and
obviously they are inviting the nurse to have a New Year's
toast with them.  They laugh; and the nurse steps away from
the room for a moment.

Bussetta moves slowly back into the room, alone with the
helpless Roth.

He leads the boy down the street, whispering to him, on the

INT. NEW GENCO WAREHOUSE - DAY

A newly acquired warehouse, stocked with cases of the new
product "GENCO PURA" olive oil.  It is the beginning of a
new business, in the American tradition.  Now they have one
rattling old truck, and a few stock boys.

Genco has become the accountant-business manager, based on
the experience working with his father.  But it is clear,
that Vito is the leader, and undisputed 'President' of the
new enterprise.

Genco moves through the darkness of the warehouse, to the
small divided area that Vito uses as his office.

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		The 'patrone' is here.

				VITO
		Chi?

				GENCO
		Roberto.  Who owns the 'rat-holes.'

Vito nods that he will see him; and soon Roberto enters, on
tiptoe, his hat in his hand, and in a apologetic voice.

		Excuse me, I hope I am not a

Senator Kane is stunned.  The two FBI men are alert, their
eyes searching the room for what has intimidated their
witness at the last moment.

				SENATOR KANE
		Mr. Pentangeli, you are

		in the olive oil business with his
		father a long time ago.  That's all.

				SENATOR KANE
		We have your confession that you
		murdered on the orders of Michael
		Corleone.  Do you deny that
		confession and do you know what
		denying that confession will mean
		to you?

The die is cast and like a good soldier, Pentangeli will go
all the way now.  So he is brazen in his defiance of the
Senator.

				PENTANGELI
		The FBI guys promised me a deal.
		So I made up a lot of stuff about
		Michael Corleone.  Because then,
		that's what they wanted.  But it
		was all lies.  Everything.  They
		said Michael Corleone did this,
		Michael Corleone did that.  So I
		said, "Yeah, sure."

He makes a big grin to show how he has made fools of
everybody.

VIEW ON THE FBI AGENTS

glancing around the room; their eyes have settled on the
Sicilian.  One of them scribbles a note on a piece of paper,
and passes it to the Committee lawyer.  Then in turn it goes
to Senator Kane.

		Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify
		to this committee that gentleman

when Linda objects.

A policeman arrives and begins firing at car.  C.W. gets the
car halfway out of the spot, scraping fenders in the process,
and the car is almost out when suddenly a face looms up at
the window--a dignified, white-haired, celluloid-collared
man, obviously a bank official who has leaped onto the
running board.  His screaming can barely by distinguished
from all the noise.

            Stop!

CLYDE fires through the window.

          You are the man of her dreams? The
          Romeo of Novagrudok?
          Zus can't take anymore. He charges Tuvia, who sidesteps
          and SLAMS him in the gut. All the frustration of the past
          months, not to mention years of sibling rivalry, translates
          into fists and elbows.
          Ben Zion moves to break it up. Tuvia and Zus turn on him.

          Is this your business?
          Zus gains the upper hand and starts to beat the crap put of
          Tuvia. Finally, in desperation Tuvia rolls away and picks
          up a rock. He is about to slam it into his brother's head
          when suddenly he stops himself.
          The two brothers look at each other, both breathing heavily --
          realizing that they have crossed some line.

          He looks at Asael.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          Are you coming?
          Asael looks at one brother, then the other. Once again, he
          is in the middle. He looks at Chaya, then back at Zus.

          ASAEL
          No.

          ZUS
          Good. I'll dance at your wedding.
          He stops by Bella's side, touches her arm, then disappears
          down the trail. The others follow.

           You present a flattering
           representation. As my family will
           be traveling back shortly, perhaps
           I might commit only to one trial

           We are in the port of New Orleans, one of the busiest in
           the young nation.
           On the dock itself there is a bustle of activity as goods
           are loaded and unloaded from a various ships. It's a bit
           of controlled chaos as a VARIETY OF LANGUAGES are spoken
           and shouted while slaves are shuttled from the Orleans to
           a holding pen. Solomon, and all the slaves are
           overwhelmed by all that is happening around them.
           Two men - among many - are awaiting the arrival of the
           Orleans. They are JONUS RAY - Clemens Ray's master - and
           DAVIS who is the solicitor of Mr. Ray. They both look
           like they mean business. The moment the gangplank is
           laid, Ray yells for Clemens.
           Clemens, seeing his master, is nearly crazy with delight.
           He is, uncharacteristically beside himself. Ironically,

LOGAN
It's my fight as much as yours. The things

destroyed. I want to see all of them, all 
of them destroyed. It's my duty...in the

you look at is funny. What're you gonna do, 
walk into the Cave carryin' those tubes on

avoid a fight you won't know where to go.

goin' in there on a suicide mission. What

We're gonna blow up the powder magazine.

TOBY
What?

We know what's down there. We did the

ashore in the early days. A direct hit 
oughta do more than a few weeks worth o'

A direct hit'll blow the top off this whole

                            he'll be gone. Off to Michigan or

                            gets it in his head he wants to go.
                            Maybe he'll decide to take a tour
                            of Europe for a year and not even

A tense beat.  Shinzon regains his composure.

          You must learn patience, Commander.
          Do you know where I learned it?  In
          the dilithium mines of Remus.
          Spend eighteen hours every day
          under the lash of a Romulan guard's
          whip and you'll soon understand
          patience.

Suran and the others go.

Donatra turns just as she is leaving the chamber, she sees
the Viceroy going to Shinzon.  And then do something odd.
The Viceroy puts his hand on Shinzon's chest, leans very
close and talks to him quietly.  This is an ancient form of
Reman telepathic medical diagnosis.

This strange sight perplexes Donatra.  The doors close,
blocking her view...

INT.  SENATE - CORRIDOR - FOLLOWING

We go with Donatra and the other Romulans.  Donatra speaks
quietly to Suran:

          dilithium mines?

Picard and Shinzon sit alone in a corner of the sweeping
Senate chamber.  The remains of dinner before them.

          they run him up 6th avenue, chanting.

          shoulders.

          Among more serious-looking businessmen and woman, the raucous
          tour-de-France style congratulations party continues.
          Walter's just being mobbed by ecstatic Frenchmen.
                         
          INT. FORTIETH FLOOR, ELEVATOR LOBBY - LATER
                         
          No one's around. We hear the quiet "ding" of the elevator
          arriving. Then Walter gets out. There are no crowds anywhere -
          just Walter in his short-sleeve dress shirt, tie and
          briefcase. He reaches his division floor offices door and
          enters his pass-key. Then his mom walks up - EDNA MITTY, 76.
                         
                                                EDNA

                    Someone else told me that. An hour
                    ago. Hey, I don't want to take up
                    too much more of your time. But I'd
                    like my severance. There's no cause
                    to keep it from me. That's what I
                    was trying to tell you downtown. I
                    did my job well for nine years.

Salander sends Armansky a weary look. His look back
begs her not to say anything unpleasant. Eventually -

          He's clean.   In my opinion.

                        SALANDER
          He's honest. He's who he presents
          himself to be. In his business,
          that's an asset.

                        FRODE
          There's less in his asset column
          after his conviction today.
                        SALANDER
          That's true. He made a fool of
          himself with that. If it happened
          that way.
Frode looks at Armansky.    What's that supposed to mean?

                        SALANDER
          If he made up the story, that's
          out of character. So is giving up
          without a fight. People don't do
          things that are out of character.

                Excuse us a moment.

      Frode and Martin step away to confer in private.

                              MARTIN
                I think Henrik would say yes.
                              FRODE
                That's why he has me. To protect
                him from himself. This is insane.
                              MARTIN
                What do we have to hide?

                              FRODE
                Over the course of 120 years of
                doing business? Plenty.

                If he needs this to do his job, he
                should have permission.
      This goes against every privileged, confidential bone
      in the lawyer's body. He can only stare at Blomkvist and
      Salander across the room, wondering why he hired either
      one of them.

Chaz follows John from the cab to the entrance. A

John glances back -- gives him an impassive look.   Chaz

INT. CLUB MIDNITE

MUSIC FLOODS this exclusive establishment. It's a clash
of cultures and influences not easily dated. A retro
speakeasy for the new millennium.
John walks through a maze of passages while the fantasies
of a twisted city play out in the shadows. He pauses,
sees a clan of suited businessmen in a corner, showing
off for several ladies.
One fills a line of shot glasses from a pitcher of water.
Another waves his hand over them, turns the water into
RED WINE. The ladies are very impressed, drink up.
NICO, a young black man, walks past John.

                           NICO

             Neighborhood's going to Hell.
John offers a half smile. He likes this kid, walks on.
One of the men in the group turns, watches John.
Balthazar. He grins and pockets that odd COIN.

John starts up a long flight of stairs, stops in front of

SWEEP ACROSS a meticulously-crafted ORRERY, a scientific

This is an orrery of the forces of the Universe.      And

This is actually the POV FROM John's Barracuda.

Elevator opens and John steps out into a lobby of
concrete and glass. Pretentious design screams money.
Lots of it.
Since trading is still a half hour away, the place is
practically empty.
Across the room a stainless steal DOOR HISSES open. John
looks the other way as a Security Guard exits. Thick
DOOR glides closed, seals with another HISS. No way in.
John notices the janitor down one hallway. It's Nico
from Midnite's. He and John lock stares. Nico opens a
"Security Only" door, steps inside -- leaves the door
open.

Balthazar walks through, looking every bit like the smug

MIRROR on one wall. Adjusts his collar, his hair. His
"look."

                           PRETTY BOY

As Balthazar admires himself, his reflection distorts
slightly. The demon in him? He touches his face, does a
vowel stretch. His face distorts even further.
That's got him moving closer to the mirror.
Balthazar's concerned because now his skin appears
in motion, rippling as if liquefied. And just when he
sees the surface of the mirror BLISTERING and starts to
move --

BOOOM --

One way GLASS EXPLODES outward on the front edge of a
FIREBALL -- sending Balthazar flying with glass and
flame.
John stands on the other side in an ACCESS CHANNEL --
that Dragon's breath flamethrower now duct-taped to his
holy shotgun.

from the floor. Suit's in shreds, half his face is
burned off, but now he's pissed.

                    A girl I hardly even know. It was
                    nothing to me, but she got a little
                    carried away. She's just a kid...
                    Anyway, it's over now. It's really
                    over. If I weren't sure of that I
                    guess I could never have told you

                    Baby, I don't know. I think it was
                    a simple case of wanting to be a
                    man again after all that abortion
                    business. Some kind of neurotic,

AS IT LEISURELY MOVES ALONG THE ROADWAY BORDERED BY MILES OF
SAGEBRUSH. Harold drives, Fran is again in the front seat
beside her husband... a scrunched up sack of food beside her.
She wipes her mouth with a napkin, shoves it inside the paper
bag, then turns to watch the passing scenery. Rudy sits in
the back, eating spareribs. He suddenly throws a just
finished bone at Fran, hitting her on the shoulder.

He laughs and again throws another bone at Fran. She suddenly
catches his mood and begins laughing herself ... tossing a
bone back at Rudy.

HAROLD CONTINUES DRIVING. His knuckles whiten around the
steering wheel as a sparerib bounces off the window in front
of him.

THE KITTEN IS SLEEPING WITHIN the cardboard box, oblivious to
Rudy and Fran's laughter. (That will be the day.)

     The interior decorating equivalent of highballs and pretzels,
     which is exactly what Vogel, Bucky and Ellis Loew are
     consuming. Bucky drinks with the trepidation of the King's
     food taster.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               I called this little meeting for a couple
               reasons, Bucky.
               We'd both like to see the Short case
               closed out and get back to normal
               business.

     Bucky looks impatient and Ellis senses this.

                          ELLIS LOEW (cont'd)
               We're both comers, Bucky. Fritzie wants
               you for his partner when he gets his
               lieutenancy, and--

               You're too raw for him, boyo. Old Russ is
               a sob sister, and I'm much more your type.

     Bucky considers the truth in this. To Loew:

                          BUCKY
               What do you want, Ellis?

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Very well, Dwight. I'll tell you. There
               are four confessors still being held at
               City Jail. They've got no alibis, weren't
               coherent when they were first questioned,
               and they're all violent, frothing-at-the-

     They enter and look around: well,     it's not awful, but
     it sure as hell isn't wonderful.     The room is dark, on
     the small side, and shows the lack    of a woman's hand.
     Caroline looks a bit taken aback,    but tries to hide it
     by saying the word "nice" over and    over.
     The CAMERA FOLLOWS them FROM room TO room:
                             DWIGHT
               Okay, so that was the living room;
               over here is the kitchen -- I plan
               on getting all new fixtures in
               here -- and down that hall are the
               three bedrooms and the bath.
     He stops at an extra, no-particular-purpose, nondescript
     room furnished only by two easy chairs and a card table.

               This is sort of a lounging area.

               to...

           (it pours out)
           My dad, Elias Disney, he owned a
           newspaper delivery route there.
           Thousand papers. Twice daily.
           Morning and evening edition. Elias,
           he was a tough businessman. A save-
           a-penny anywhere you can type of
           fella so he wouldn't employ any
           delivery boys, he just used me and
           my big brother Roy. I was eight
           then-- eight years old.

                          (BEAT)
           Like I said, those winters were
           harsh and old Elias didn't believe
           in new shoes until the old ones
           were worn right through so--

                          (BEAT)
           Honestly, Mrs Travers, the snow

          Marat nods, considering this. Reaches to the FISH. He
          takes the EYE out of the fish and starts to suck on it.

          Jonathan wades confidently through a sea of YOUNG EXECUTIVES.
          He approaches a REDHEADED BUSINESSWOMAN. He asks her

          to Jonathan and YET ANOTHER WOMAN having sex. The bed
          keeps banging against the night stand - a glass of water,

          almost rote about it, a numbness in the repetition... the
          glass FALLS, HITS the ground and BREAKS.

          INT. THE PENINSULA - HEALTH CLUB - MORNING

          Jonathan doing laps. He emerges from the pool, strides with
          confidence past the tourists flanking him on either side:
          OLDER COUPLES snoozing, PARENTS adjusting floaties on kids,
          BUSINESS TRAVELLERS with airport novels.
          He continues toward us, hair slicked back, like Wyatt's.

          Jonathan, for so long I don't see you!

          When was this?

          JONATHAN
          A few weeks ago. Wyatt Bose. Wait... here.
          He hands her Wyatt's business card with the Rutherford Stern
          masthead on it. She studies it with a look of confusion.

          POMERANTZ
          I don't know what's going on, but I can
          assure you, there is nobody here named-

          JONATHAN
          I've seen him in the halls                                      - for Chrissake

          Ms. Pomerantz abruptly frowns, when Jonathan spots a LAWYER -

          This Lawyer and another laughing at Wyatt's punch line.
          Jonathan runs over to the Lawyer, grabs the man's arm.

          Thank God. Look, I'm trying to find Wyatt.

          Jonathan is flipping through the stack of photocopies, then
          halts on one. He stares at it. The Receptionist peers over.

          RECEPTIONIST
          That's him? He was real cute. Only he
          wasn't a lawyer. He was a systems analyst,
          I think. He was here for a few days to
          work on the computers.
          RECEPTIONIST'S POV: of the photocopy in Jonathan's hand. It's
          of a Massachusetts Driver's License. Staring back up at us is
          Wyatt's smiling face.

          matches is returned. Jonathan readies himself, then dives in.
          Beside the keyboard rests the receptionist's photocopy of
          William Bansky's Massachusetts driver's license. We see
          Detective Russo's business card resting a few inches away.

          ON JONATHAN - MOMENTS LATER
          Checking URLs site by site. He finally pauses on one. It's an
          article from the Boston Herald. The headline: "POLICE HAVE

          Across from him sits Black Business Suit. A YOUNGER MAN steps
          into frame, rests his hand on Holloway's shoulder.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT                                             (V.0.)
          At first I assumed he was a junior
          executive at their firm. But he wasn't.
          That's not to say he didn't work for
          Holloway, but clearly in a more intimate
          capacity...

          TNT. THE MICHELANGELO - ROOM - NIGHT
          Black Business Suit takes a cool drag on her cigarette.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          I wasn't shocked. Besides, obviously I'm
          no prude. Even back then, I'd been doing -
          you know, this thing -- for a while.

          INT. EXPENSIVE CHICAGO RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Wyatt is talking, entertaining his two companions - but
          clearly more focused on Black Business Suit, flirting it up.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT                                             (V.0.)
          I was simply curious. More so when he
          apologized, explaining that he'd forgotten
          about another engagement.
          Wyatt's knuckles just barely stroke Black Business Suit's
          thigh as he rises to leave. They exchange a knowing glance...

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          I was intrigued. He was intelligent,
          informed about everything from law to art
          to politics. I'd never met anyone so in
          command of his own charm. He said that
          he'd come from nothing, that everything he
          learned, he learned from his tricks. He
          claimed that Holloway was even grooming
          him for a position at his company.
          She lights another cigarette with her old one.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          In a way, I felt for him. But I also
          admired him. It sounds silly,. but he had a
          way of making me feel - close to him, you
          know?
          This clearly hits home with Jonathan. He barely nods.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          So I found myself telling him things..
          Personal things. And, next thing I knew -

          JONATHAN
          You told him. About this.
          A beat, and she nods, crushing out her other cigarette.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          He seemed fascinated by it. Wanted to know
          all the details.

          Wyatt and Black Business Suit go at it with animal

          nearly unbearable, eyes clenched shut as she climaxes.
          Exhausted, her body goes limp.
          TILT UP to his face: an eerily blank, driven stare, devoid of

          Wait - thank you.

          Have you ever run into him again?

          Black Business Suit is crossing the lobby for a portrait of
          Hearst and A SUITED MAN lingering beneath it... when the man
          looks up. It's Wyatt.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT                                            (V.0.)
          I almost didn't recognize him. But when I
          did, I suddenly felt very, very scared.
          She freezes -- obscured by one of the trees as Wyatt checks
          his watch, scans-the lobby with a cool, piercing look.

          BACK TO BLACK BUSINESS SUIT AND JONATHAN IN THE MICHELANGELO

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          I left before he saw me.
          She drags on her cigarette, looks off into space.

          BLACK BUSINESS SUIT
          He must have used my cell phone to get
          into the group.
          (crushes out her cigarette)
          Anyway, that's it. That's all I know.

          That was his name. Jamie Getz.

          EXT. FLEUR DE SOLANGE - NIGHT

          Bundled in her ski jacket, Solange is closing up her shop for
          the night, stacks of flowers in her arms, when she notices
          Jonathan coming down the front steps.

          SOLANGE
          Jonathan, you're home early -
          Only when he looks up, she finds the young man in the
          overcoat isn't Jonathan. It's Wyatt.

          SOLANGE
          Oh - je suis desole. My mistake.
          Wyatt flashes her an icy smile, continues down the steps.
          Solange watches him walk away, a puzzled look on her face.

          INT. MICHELANGELO - HOTEL BUSINESS CENTER - NIGHT

          Huddled over a computer, Jonathan typing, eyes red from
          exhaustion and stress as we hear his recall:

          JONATHAN (V.0.)
          who's James Getz?

          WYATT (V.0.)
          A guy I roomed with freshman year at
          Princeton.
          on Jonathan's monitor we see he's on a web site for Princeton
          University alumni. He types in: Getz, James.
          A beat - then: "No match." A long list of G names follows.
          Jonathan scrolls down the list, but there's no Getz.

          JONATHAN
          Shit.
          Jonathan exhales, about to log off - when a name among the
          H's jumps out at him: Holloway. Reed.
          Jonathan stares at it tensely - then clicks on the name.
          "Sort no contact information available."
          Jonathan thinks a moment - then tries a search engine, types:
          "Holloway Reed" then decides to add the word "missing."
          An article appears. From the Chicago Tribune: "BODY OF
          MISSING BUSINESSMAN FINALLY DISCOVERED." A head-shot style
          photograph shows a man in his early 40s whom we recognize
          from Black Business Suit's story. Beneath his photo, his
          name: "Reed Holloway."

          EXTREME CLOSE ON THE IMAGE OF HER FACE. The smile, frozen in
          time, at once haunting and heartbreaking.

                 That's fantastic. See, if we're
                 talking that kind of volume I can
                 absolutely massage the numbers a

                 I'll call you. Not a problem. No
                 problem at all. Even better, I'll
                 swing by. You're on my route. How
                 `bout that? I'll swing by tomorrow.

                 Thursday then. That's better
                 anyway. That'll give you a chance
                 to take a look see on those other
                 stores. We'll put everything on one

    The owner seems to consider the offer. Joe scans the shelves.

     TV movie circa 1982. Big hair and leg warmers. Norah leans
     out the window and exhales, takes another toke.

     The sound of a key at the door prompts Norah to quickly stub
     out the joint and close the window. Rose opens the door.

               And we're not going to spend the
               money. We're going to invest the
               money.

     Joe plunks in some quarters, dials, waits while it rings.

                         JOE
               See, that's the difference between
               a regular person and somebody with
               business acumen. That's a good word
               for you to know. A-cu-men. Means
               smarts.

     Oscar nods and sips his Coke.

               Bobby! Joe Lorkowski here.
                   (laughs)
               I told you I'd call.
                   (pause)
               Yeah well, I got the money and
               we're in. But you gotta throw in
               twenty bags of ice.

     Rose pays bills at the kitchen table. Oscar bounces a super
     ball.

                         OSCAR
               We're gonna make the money grow
               because that's the smart way. It's
               capital and you don't spend that.
               You invest it. That way you can get
               the SP250 and have money left over.

                         ROSE
               What are you talking about?

     Oscar races out of the kitchen and then races back in with a
     pamphlet showcasing the amazingly sleek SP250 binoculars. He
     hands the pamphlet to Rose.

The bus pulls up to a stop, the door opens, and the
passengers begin to file out. The McKennas, together
with Louis Bernard, are the last off the bus. Arab
helpers have already climbed to the roof of the bus,
to unload the baggage. The clean-cut airline baggage
of the McKennas is in sharp contrast to the Hessianroped
bundles of the Arabs. There are nearby fiacres to
take the people to their various destinations in the
city, and some small, undersized taxi cabs.

however, now convinced that he has the right man in

     INT. TRUCK STOP/DINER - LATER

     It is a little worn diner-type stop one would find on most any
     open road:  Counter with stools, laminated menus, a Wurlitzer in
     the corner belching out country TUNES.  Business is slow but
     it's the only restaurant in town. There is a SHORT ORDER COOK in
     the kitchen, and FLO, a hard-looking waitress is behind the
     counter.  A couple of regular drivers, ED and BOYD, are seated
     on the stools, Boyd is flipping a coin.

             honest business.

                       BOBBY
             Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?

                       DARRELL (pause)
             Well, there's a $50 overnight storage
             charge we got to talk about.

     Bobby is ready at first to explode, but then just laughs out
     loud. You got to give it to a guy like Darrell. He holds up a
     $100 bill.

                       BOBBY
             All I got's a hundred, Darrell. You got change?

                       DARRELL
             No.

                       BOBBY
             Figgers. There's a scratch on the hood and how
             much you make selling my gun? Deduct it.

     Bobby pulls the hundred back from Darrell's grasp.

                       DARRELL (going to get the keys)
             Don't know nothing about no gun.

                         Over the next hour, I described my 
                         love for Sandra Kay Templeton, and 
                         the ordeal that brought me before 
                         them. As it had always been, this

                              (Stacy shakes her

                         was really great at it. Poor Freddie.

                         her, she had the business from all 
                         these retail stores? But she was 
                         like, totally old, it was more'n she

               INT. MR. GUMB'S PARLOR - DAY

               Clarice, pulling her notebook from her shoulder bag, glances 
               around the musty-looking room.

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                         That horrible business, I shiver 
                         every time I think about it...

               Overstuffed furniture, porcelain figurines. One archway onto 
               the front hall, another onto a dining alcove, and through 
               there, the kitchen. Mr. Gumb is crossing to a rolling desk, 
               raising the top. He bends over, begins poking through cubby 
               holes. His tone is casual, neutral.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Are they close to catching somebody,

                         I think we may be, yes.

               Mr. Gumb stiffens, almost imperceptibly. His back is to her, 
               as he continues opening drawers, rustling papers.

                                     CLARICE
                         Mr. Gordon, did you take over this 
                         place after Mrs. Lippman died?

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Yes. I bought the house from her, 
                         two years ago.

                         Did she leave any records here? Tax 
                         or business records? Maybe a list of

                         No, nothing at all. Has the FBI 
                         learned something? Because the police 
                         here don't seem to have the first 
                         clue...

               Out of the folds of his kimono crawls a Death's-head Moth. 
               It creeps slowly to the center of his back, raising its wings.

                         Do you have his description yet, or 
                         some fingerprints...?

               CLARICE

               unaware, is still glancing around the room. For several 
               agonizing moments, we think she won't see the moth - but 
               then she turns, does see it, and her eyes freeze. A beat of 
               pure fear. A tremendous struggle to keep her voice calm.

               keeps her distance. They are about ten feet apart.

                         Good, thank you. Mr. Gordon, do you 
                         have a phone I can use?

               MR. GUMB

               is about to reply when the moth suddenly flies up from behind 
               him, flutters past his face. He turns, looking at it. He 
               looks back at Clarice, his mouth still open.

The same intelligent piercing eyes, twenty-five years older. Elijah has grown
into a handsome, regal looking man. He leans on a walking stick.

depicted on the top of a building locked in fierce battle. One figure is
extremely muscular with a mask. The other is half human, half animal.

           Interesting pictures. Kind of European.
           Shannon arranged the cars for us and did
           all the stunts. I knew he was overcharging
           me but I loved having him around. His next

           with some of Nino's friends they broke his

           look between them but his only reaction is to drain his glass
           and tuck into his food.

                        GUIDO
          Go, go.   Wait. Your face.

          What about it?

                       GUIDO
          Get your makeup.

Guido switches on the light, puts on his glasses, and
tilts the lamp shade up. He begins to pencil in a
beauty mark and darken her eyes. He is meticulous
about this, and precise, and takes his time to make it
exactly as he wants it.

Doctor Rondi is brisk.   He nods to Guido that they go
outside.

                       DOCTOR RONDI
          Signor Contini.

As Guido makes to leave -

          Come back.

Guido reassures her with a gesture.


INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE PENSIONE BEDROOM - NIGHT

Guido and Doctor Rondi come out. Guido is concerned.
Doctor Rondi writes out a prescription as he talks.

                       DOCTOR RONDI
          She took five or six pills, enough to
          make herself very sick. I understand
          she's your mistress.
                 (Guido can't answer)
          This is a sordid business. You movie
          people, I suppose you don't consider
          yourself bound by morality...

Guido doesn't fight. Rondi hands him the prescription,
picks up his bag, turns and walks away, leaving Guido
leaning against the wall...

BATEMAN 
Let me guess-you live in the East Village?

Pause.

STASH 
SoHo.

COURTNEY RAWLINSON and LUIS CARRUTHERS arrive at the table. 
Courtney is blonde, classically beautiful and from 
precisely the same social background as Evelyn, but she is 
considerably more fragile and neurotic. Luis is 
half-English, half-Argentinean, slightly overweight (a 
rarity in this crowd), puppyish and eager to please. He 
wears the same type of designer clothes as Price and 
Bateman, but with foppish tendencies: velvet jackets, 
bow-ties, boldly patterned vests.

They exchange air kisses. As soon as Luis turns his back, 
Bateman sneaks a kiss on Courtney's neck.

COURTNEY 
(Whispering) 
Stop it!

Stash and Vanden watch them in silence.

LATER:

Price is whispering in Evelyn's ear. Everyone else is 
quietly eating, except Bateman, who is drinking and watching 
Evelyn and Price.

BATEMAN (V.O.)
I am fairly sure that Timothy and Evelyn 
are having an affair. Timothy is the only interesting
person I know. Courtney is almost perfect looking. She s 
usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs. Tonight 
I believe it's Xanax. More disturbing than her drug use, 
though, is the fact that she's engaged to Luis Carruthers, 
the biggest dufus in the business.

Courtney rouses herself from her drug haze.

COURTNEY
Tell me. Stash...do you think SoHo is 
becoming to...commercial?

CARRUTHERS 
Yes, I read that.

PRICE 
Oh, who gives a rat's ass?

VANDEN 
Hey. That affects us.

Two things. One. You can't bleach a Soprani. Out of the question.

Two. I can only get these sheets in Santa Fe. These are very 
expensive sheets and I really need them clean.

She keeps talking and Bateman leans into her.

BATEMAN 
If you don't shut your fucking mouth I will kill 
you, are you understanding me?

She talks faster.

BATEMAN 
Now listen-I have a very important lunch meeting 
(Checks Rolex) 
at Hubert's in thirty minutes, and I need those 
...no wait, twenty minutes. I have a lunch meeting at 
Hubert's in twenty minutes with Ronald Harrison and I need 
those sheets cleaned by this afternoon.

She keeps talking.

BATEMAN Listen. I cannot understand you.

Bateman starts laughing, slaps his hand down on the 
counter.

BATEMAN 
This is crazy. You're a fool. I can't cope with 
this.

Bateman is on the verge of tears.

BATEMAN 
Stupid bitchee! Understand? Oh Christ!

Someone enters the store behind him. It's VICTORIA, 
late-twenties, attractive but a little overweight, wearing a 
tailored business suit with white sneakers and sports socks.

VICTORIA 
Patrick?

She takes off her sunglasses.

VICTORIA 
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.

Hello

Bateman is visibly irritated, recrosses his legs.

BATEMAN 
Well, I work on Wall Street. At Pierce &amp; Pierce. 
(Long pause) 
Have you heard of it?

Another long pause. They shake their heads. Christie stands 
up and goes over to the CD collection.

CHRISTIE 
You have a really nice place here...Paul. 
How much did you pay for it?

BATEMAN 
Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, 
hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.

Bateman leaves to refill his wine glass and Sabrina takes a 
pack of cigarettes out of her purse.
Bateman returns, carrying a tray of chocolates.

BATEMAN 
No, no smoking. Not in here.

He walks over to Christie.

BATEMAN 
Varda truffle?

Christie stares at the plate and shakes her head. Sabrina 
takes one.

BATEMAN 
I don't want you to get drunk, but that's a very 
fine Chardonnay you're not drinking.

Bateman goes over to his CDs and scans his vast collection. 
He takes one out and examines it.

BATEMAN 
Do you like Phil Collins? I've been a big Genesis 
fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before 
that I really didn't understand any of their work. It was too 
artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins' 
presence became more apparent. He puts aside the CD and takes out 
another one.

No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was

McDERMOTT 
So what did Ed say?

BATEMAN 
He said, "When I see a pretty girl walking down the 
street I think two things. One part of me wants to take her 
out and talk to her and be real nice and sweet and treat 
her right."

Pauses, finishes his drink.

McDERMOTT 
What does the other part of him think?

BATEMAN 
What her head would look like on a stick.

McDermott and Van Patten look at each other and then back 
at Bateman. Bateman starts to laugh, and the other two uneasily
join In.

Luis Carruthers walks up to the table.

CARRUTHERS 
(Shyly) 
Hi, guys. I wanna get your opinion on something.

McDermott rolls his eyes at the rest of the table.

McDERMOTT If it's about the bow-tie you're wearing, you 
know how we feel about it. Luis laughs good-naturedly.

CARRUTHERS 
Yes, I do. No, it's my business card-I decided to 
get a new one too.

He pulls out something incredibly tasteful. Everyone 
compliments Luis except Bateman. The SOUND DROPS and all we hear 
is the beating of his heart as he stares at the card enviously. 
Luis plucks it from his hand and walks away, pleased with 
himself.

VAN PATTEN 
Listen, what about dinner?

BATEMAN 
(Suddenly angry) 
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about 
fucking dinner?" 

McDERMOTT 
Ah, cheer up, Bateman. 
(Slaps him on the back, massages his neck) 
What's the matter? No shiatsu this morning? 

BATEMAN 
(Watching Luis going into the men's room) 
Keep touching me like that and you'll draw back a stump.

McDERMOTT 
Whoa, hold on there, little buddy.

BATEMAN 
Excuse me.

He gets up from the table. As Bateman walks away, Van 
Patten grabs a waiter.

                  Honey, these are my brothers.

81   EXT. HARLEM - LATER - DAY                                         81

     Tango strolls down the street like he's the Godfather of
     Harlem, girl on his arm, bodyguard at his side.

82   INT. DINER - SAME TIME                                            82

     As his brothers eat lunch, Frank - who can see Tango outside
     - uncaps a glass sugar container.

                               FRANK
                  What matters in business is honesty,
                  integrity, hard work, loyalty, and never
                  forgetting where you came from.

     For reasons his brothers can't imagine, Frank empties all
     sugar from the container onto his plate.
                               FRANK
                  You are what you are and that's one of
                  two things. You're nothing ... or you're
                  something. Understand what I'm saying?

     The brothers nod tentatively, stare at the now-empty glass
     container. Frank wipes his mouth with a napkin, gets up.

                               FRANK
                  I'll be right back.

     He comes out of the diner, crosses the street toward Tango,
     who's buying fruit. Greets him cheerfully -

                  Hey, Tango, what's up.    I was just

      playing through a state-of-the-art stereo system. It's a

                   in safety deposit boxes; give him a call.

                   could be a historic moment, and you're
                   sipping a glass of ice water.

                   Frank Lucas.

      No one in the room, except Richie and Toback, has ever
      heard the name. The federal men regard one another blankly.

                                US ATTORNEY
                   Who?  Who's Frank Lucas?
                          (no one seems to know)
                   Who's he work for? Which family?

                   He's not Italian. He's black.

      Now there's a longer, even deeper silence, before -

                                US ATTORNEY
                   Is that supposed to be some kind of joke?
                   You're this close to the end of your
                   career in law enforcement, you're making
                   jokes?

                                RICHIE
                   I believe Frank Lucas is above the mafia
                   in the dope business. I believe he buys
                   direct from the source in Southeast Asia,
                   cuts out all the middlemen, and uses US
                   military planes and personnel to bring
                   pure No. 4 heroin into United States.

      Richie is looking at faces that are still trying to make
      sense out of his ridiculous theory. Toback tries to come to
      his defense -
                                TOBACK
                   Richie has a lot of experience -

                                US ATTORNEY
                   Does he. And how many arrests has he
                   made in his so-called investigation?

                                RICHIE
                   I was promised when I took this job, it
                   was about real arrests.

                                US ATTORNEY
                   Does that mean `none?'

George grins crazily, ecstatically.

	Andy... THEY SAID YES!  They agreed
	to it all!  They thought your terms
	were a shining example of your
	"irreverent wit" -- and precisely
	why they want you!
		(beat)
	You're getting EVERYTHING!

Whoa.  Andy looks up, astonished.  His space station
EXPLODES, but he doesn't notice.  He turns to George... and
slowly smiles sweetly.  Genuinely.

Andy dumps out wet coffee grounds.  He is sweating.  In the
b.g., George enters the restaurant.  He sees Andy, sits at a
table and YELLS OUT.

		GEORGE
	Hey!  Could you clear this table and
	bring me a piece of poundcake?

Andy turns.  They stare down each other.

	Andy, this is ridiculous.  Take off

	NO!  I'd rather work here, than at

	Yeah, we can have a garage sale.

               (then)
           Hang on, looks like there's one
           on this side too.

Sam 2 is indeed approaching something similar.

Sam 1 stops his Rover about twenty feet from the Jammer. He
opens the Rover's door and steps out to take a closer look.


WIDE SHOT -- SAM 1/ROVER

Taking in the Jammer and the adjacent Rover. Sam 1 loping
towards the Jammer, seemingly in slow motion.

The JAMMER is GIGANTIC --An intimidating, stark pole
stabbed into the lunar landscape, like the worlds biggest
caber. Next to it Sam 1 is tiny, a white dot, as
insignificant as a pin prick.

Sam 1 and Sam 2

We cut back and forth between the two Sams as they both
investigate the separate but identical-looking Jammers.

                      SAM 2 (CONT'D)
           I can just make out the top. Must
           be a hundred feet tall at least.
           It's huge!

                     SAM 1
           Whoever built these things meant
           business. They weren't fucking
           around.

Their voices ENERGIZED -- they are excited to have made
this discovery -- they aren't dealing with the negatives
yet.

                     SAM 1 (CONT'D)
           What do you think?

                     SAM 2
           Its not an antennae, dude. Its a
           jammer.
               (looking around)
           No wonder we can't get a live
           feed. These things must be
           blocking our signal.

Suddenly Sam 1 doubles over. He vomits thick, viscous
blood and sick into his helmet. Revolting.

The noise is AUDIBLE over the microphone.

                                                                         62.

                         Actually, the Army has given me leave

                         and now I'm on leave to help my mother--
                         I'm just trying to get her ready for 
                         the harvest. She's no farmer. Apples 
                         were my dad's business. And with the 
                         war on, she's short on pickers.

               Homer is in semidarkness as he walks toward the cider house.

                                     MR. ROSE (O.S.)

               Homer walks faster. When he gets to the cider house, he sees 
               Mr. Rose and Rose Rose arguing. Rose is sitting on the 
               bicycle, a bundle of her clothes tied up behind the seat.

          He bet his friend he could get in
          your pants in less than twelve
          hours, starting noon today.
          Our Hero rises to his feet and pushes Mitch in the chest, which

          He pushes again and Mitch,s hand shoots out like a snake
          striking. Grabs him by the collar. Lifts him. A frozen
          moment, more violence just a breath away, and a sense of things
          about to spin out of control... Our Hero's eyes are popping;
          he tries to hide his fear:

          I want to know what I'm worth.
          Our Hero gestures to Mitch: would you mind putting me down?
          Mitch reluctantly obliges.
          Our Hero does his best to recollect his dignity. Looks at
          Slim. Drops a ten on the table and smirks:

                         OUR HERO
          The bet was two, but now that I
          know you? Way too high.
          A pained look flashes across Slim's face -
          Our Hero starts toward the door, but Mitch steps in his path.
          Speaks quietly but with authority; there's a physical power in
          his words. Since he's protecting Slim, the power is

          JIM RIVALDO flops down into the vintage dental chair that
          sits in front of Harvey's desk. He seems to be looking for
          something to occupy his keen mind. A sharply dressed young

          (reading the article)
          They endorsed you for being a good
          businessman? Has Scott read this?
          He'll piss himself.

          Morning Annie, let's set Cleve up
          on mail.

          ANNE KRONENBERG
          Will do.

          HARVEY MILK
          Come into my office...

          83 INT. CITY HALL / HARVEY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          Harvey walks in. Michael and Jim are in a strategy session.

          HARVEY MILK
          The first order of business that
          will come out of this office is a
          city wide Gay Rights Ordinance.
          Just like the one Anita shot down
          in Dade County. What do you think,
          Lotus Blossom?

          MICHAEL WONG
          I think it's good. Not great.

          HARVEY MILK
          Then make it brilliant. I want
          Anita's attention here. In San
          Francisco. I want her to bring her
          fight to US... This Bill needs a
          unanimous vote. We need headlines.

          JIM RIVALDO
          Dan White won't vote for this.
          Harvey puts his fingers to his lips and points down the hall,
          indicating Dan is down there. Harvey whispers:

          HARVEY MILK
          Dan's fine. He's just uneducated.
          We can teach him.
          Dan pops his head into Harvey's office.

          What are you working on, Dan?

          DAN WHITE
          If you have something to discuss,
          you can have your aide make an
          appointment with my aide.

          HARVEY MILK
          Listen, I know you're disappointed
          about the Psychiatric Center...
          What else do you have coming up?

          DAN WHITE
          Now you need something from me.
          You want my me to join in with the
          Queers on this Prop Six business?

          HARVEY MILK
          We prefer the word "gay," Dan.
          Just as I'm sure you prefer the
          word, "Irish-American" to "Mick."

          DAN WHITE
          Harvey, our society can't exist
          without the family, without the
          church.

          HARVEY MILK
          We're not against those things.

          I think maybe we're best with our
          backs to the wall. It's too quiet.
          (a new idea, what's next)
          I think we should march on
          Washington D.C. next year.

          CLEVE JONES
          Milk, you're a decent politician, a
          mediocre businessman, but you're a
          lousy gay man.
          (Harvey knows what he's
          getting at)
          Take some time off. Fifty's right
          around the corner.

          Nobody will want you after that...
          I can handle D.C.

          CLEVE JONES
          They did. There's nowhere to march
          tonight, Mr. Harvey Milk. Lets go
          back inside.
          Turning back, they savor the moment, like father and son
          walking to Castro Camera, growing ever smaller in the frame.

          Dan White slides a sealed letter across a desk to an Aide.
          It's addressed to Moscone. He seems oddly calm.

          Could you give this to the Mayor
          for me? As soon as possible.

INT. CAR: KLUTE DRIVING - DAY

Klute has laid his jacket aside, rolled his

sandwich. The CAR RADIO is on. He leans forward,

She starts for the door -- he's already turning

Glossies, laughing prettily at her own
forgetfulness.

	Thank you very much.

EXT. STREET - DAY

BREE comes out, pauses with notebook to cross out,
the call completed, checks the list of those
remaining, sets forth again. We hear TRASK'S VOICE
OVER, very quick, very clipped.

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BREE, KLUTE - NIGHT

Klute is alseep -- more or less -- on his stomach.
Bree beside him lies awake. She trails her fingers
about his back. A rather tentative, exploratory
business. Her expression is more wondering than
anything else -- what does she have here, and can
she get used to it?

The street's first stirrings. From not far off, the

Klute half sits up in bed. Bree is fast asleep with
her head pillowed on his midsection. Some humor in
this shot: he wants to move but doesn't want to
wake her. At a point he risks it, reaches out for
something beside the bed. Her eyes open
immediately. He puts his hand on her face, trying
gently to press her back.

He seems not to have heard the request. He sits for
a moment. An intellectual interest, a curiosity.
(Meanwhile, perhaps, we see her starting to slip
her shoes off, in hopes of running.)

			CABLE
	It puzzles me so badly. I've done
	terrible things but I can't

	use it against me. Within the

Klute turns from looking down, moves to where Bree
kneels on the floor. He hunkers down.

withal -- as if to a child --

KLUTE is packing to leave. We follow him about as
he carries clothing from closet and bureau, folds
it into his suitcase on the table. We hear the
familiar FOOTSTEPS on the stairs. Bree's KNOCK. He
lets her in, keeps on about his business. His
expression is sober; hers is quite tentative.

			BREE
	Hi.

He doesn't at least expel her. She ventures in,
sits on the table, swings her heels, watches him
pack. His arm impairs him. At length --

	I got a call from Ross this

          regiment of soldiers march through the street. Geese
          scatter; shopkeepers stand in their doorways. The two
          Bennet girls simper at the handsome young soldiers. Mrs

          A pause. What on earth does Mr Darcy want? He paces up

                         DARCY
          This is a charming house. I believe my

          Collins first arrived.

          window and into the drawing room. Mr Darcy enters and
          bows to Mr Bingley. He starts to talk in earnest. Bingley

     glasses on, a glass of iced tea by his side. Strains of
     "DON'T WALK AWAY RENEE" come from a beat-up transistor
     RADIO.

     An old-fashioned lawn sprinkler lazily waves water back
     and forth over the freshly cut grass.  Throwing knives
     lay scattered nearby. A wooden post is  sticking out of
     the ground in front of the fence at the back of the yard.

     gentleman, stands nearby trying to engage Frank in a

     He holds it carefully by the blade  and throws it. It
     misses the post by three feet and  clatters against the
     fence.
     Frank opens his eyes, sees what's going on and closes his
     eyes again.
                           DEVANEY
                     (picking up another
                      knife)
              Do you really do these things?
                           FRANK
              Isn't she the one who collects
              dolls?
     This is enough to distract Devaney from his knife-throwing.

     The projector light goes off and the room light goes on.
     The room is practically bare.
     Ray Court, a prematurely white-haired, career civil
     servant, raises the window shade. Sunlight streams
     in. On Court's lapel is a tiny P.T. Boat pin.
     Terry Minella, a slight, dark 35-year-old, offers Frank
     a cigarette; Frank declines, Minella lights up.

     It's busy. Lots of customers arriving, leaving and
     seated at tables. Waiters criss-cross the terrace. Near
     the entrance, Rachel is saying goodbye to a middle-aged
     WOMAN. Frank stands nearby with Nicki. The Woman says
     something to Rachel, who turns and looks at Frank.
     Rachel whispers something to the Woman and they both
     laugh. They kiss and Rachel moves toward the entrance.

         You're too clever for me.   I can't

Frank continues to search the shop and street with his
gaze. Rachel steps closer to him.
                      RACHEL
         Look at me, Farmer!
Frank turns and looks at her.
                      RACHEL
         You don't approve of me, do you?
                      FRANK
         Disapproval's a luxury I can't
         afford. Gets in the way.
                      RACHEL
         Don't like emotions getting to you,
         huh? Never mix business with
         pleasure?
                      FRANK
         That's right.
It's a stand-off. After a moment, Rachel motions to
an outfit on a rack just behind him.
                      RACHEL
         Grab that would you?
Frank takes a beat.   Looks out the window.
                      FRANK
         I'm here to keep you alive... not
         to help you shop.
Fuming, Rachel sizes things up, then grabs it herself,
whipping the curtain shut behind her.
A smile plays across Frank's face.

       He releases her, looks at her.

                Okay.     It's not my business.

      Rachel walks swiftly out the door of the Green Room.
      Frank sits for a moment, then stands up. The bodyguard
      follows his charge to the door. He whispers hurriedly

Tony fakes a glancing blow to Frank's chin. Over by the
plane, Fletcher spots Frank and tugs at Rachel's dress,
till she turns to look. Fletcher runs up to Frank and
hugs him around the knees. Rachel approaches and Tony
moves back toward the plane.
Devaney waves in Frank's direction, tapping his watch to
indicate they are late. Frank waves and smiles.
Rachel's surprised to see Frank, but clearly happy.
Fletcher is ecstatic.
                      RACHEL
         You shouldn't be here.
Frank laughs.    There is a pause.

         So, you're quitting show business?

			(calling to Corrado 
			 from the boat)
		Do you want some blankets? ... and something 
		to eat?
 
Corrado makes an irritated gesture signifying no, then together with Sandro 
starts climbing up the rocky slope towards the stone hut. As they meet up 
with Claudia midway, the first drops of rain start to fall and it is clear 
that the storm is on the verge of breaking. The three of them reach the door 
of the hut and Corrado tries to pull it open, but the lock resists. Then 
Sandro comes to his aid, and placing their shoulders up against the wooden 
door, they finally manage to force it open.


***
Inside the hut it is pitch black. Sandro strikes a match and finds a kerosene 
lamp on a nearby table. He lights it and the room is suddenly illuminated, 
revealing a miserable interior with a few broken chairs, several empty boxes, 
a shovel and a few other utensils. Over to one side is a small pile of straw 
suggesting a makeshift bed.
 
				CLAUDIA 
		As far as I'm concerned, I think she's alive... 
		Why, even this morning... that business about 
		the shark... it wasn't at all true.

				SANDRO 
		And why do you tell us this only now?
 
				CLAUDIA 
		I... I don't know... I didn't think it was 
		worthwhile... She was laughing over it... 

				CORRADO 
		Really! Still, it remains to be seen why she 
		invented a shark. What was her purpose in that?

				WOMAN'S VOICE  
		Then it's impossible for her to know me. In the

				MAN'S VOICE  
		So? That's logical. You see, both being 
		gardeners, they spoke about you to one another. 

				WOMAN'S VOICE  
		And what did they say about me? 

				MAN'S VOICE  
		They told me that you were a very nice girl, 
		that you always mind your business... In other 
		words, things of that sort.
 
There is a moment of silence. Then, the sound of music is heard coming from 
the compartment. Claudia and Sandro look at one another with a smile on their 
faces. Then Claudia leans over to peek into the compartment. The woman is 
young; she has thick, wavy brown hair.  He is one of those typical seducers 
from the provinces, with black hair. There is a tiny radio between them. 
Sandro also takes a peek into the compartment. Then they withdraw as the two 
resume their conversation.
 
				WOMAN'S VOICE  
		We have a radio like this, too.

		No, not like this one.

				ZURIA  
		Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor? 
			
				SANDRO 
		Then let's call it a business proposition. 
		Something to round out your salary.
 
The journalist clears his throat without answering. Then he grabs Sandro by 
the arm and takes him back to the other side of the street where a few 
people, left over from the crowd, are still discussing the incident that just 
took place as they gradually drift away from the scene. The traffic is now 
back to normal.
 


***
At the Princess' villa, Claudia is in her room, applying some fresh make-up 
in front of a small dressing table. Although she appears thoroughly engrossed 
in all the minute details of her make-up, nevertheless, she seems 
considerably  interested in any sound that comes through her window.

The rumble of a motor is heard. Claudia runs to the window and looks out into 
the garden. A dark car pulls up in front of the service entrance. A uniformed 
chauffeur gets out of the car and enters the house carrying a package under 
his arm. There is an obvious look of disappointment on Claudia's face. She is 
about to return to the dressing table when she notices, there in the garden, 
Giulia heading towards the house accompanied by the young Prince, Goffredo. 
Claudia is profoundly shocked by Giulia's behavior as she laughs, jokes, 
bends over to pick up some flowers, and skips along unashamedly.

In the meantime, Patrizia has entered the room with two wigs, one of which 
she is wearing and the other in her hand. She also has on a cocktail dress, 
but one that is more elaborate than Claudia's. Patrizia immediately goes up 
to the mirror of the dressing table and, while she finishes arranging the wig 
on her head, says to her friend:

He takes Claudia by the arm and pulls her away towards the square, then looks 
attentively around the area. Bathed in the soft twilight, the buildings and 
the churches bordering the square reveal themselves in all their beauty. 
Sandro and Claudia climb up the steps of a church building and from there 
gaze at the scene. Gradually he allows himself to be overcome with 
enthusiasm. 

				SANDRO 
		Look! What a fantastic scene! What movement, 
		what disorder! They were very much concerned 
		with scenographic effects... an extraordinary 
		sense of liberty...
 
There is a moment of silence during which he continues to look at the scene 
before him. Then, giving voice to a sincere thought, he exclaims:
 
				SANDRO 
		Really, I've got to stop this business with 
		Ettore... I would like to go back and start 
		working on my own projects again. You know, I 
		had many ideas... 

				CLAUDIA 
		And why did you drop them?

				SANDRO 
		Once they gave me a job to draw up an estimate 
		for the construction of a school. It took me 
		only a day and a half to finish it, and I got 
		paid six million lire. Ever since then I've 
		been doing estimates for other people's 
		designs.
 
Claudia looks at him as if she were about to render judgment, and Sandro 
becomes aware of it.

             Wait by the phone.
                  (pause)
             You get a call.  Or maybe you
             don't.  Until then, piss off back
             to where you come from...

   Crockett flips the hand grenade and catches it with his left
   hand...and he drops it in front of Jos� Yero.  It spins on
   the table.  He had reinserted the pin.  And they back out.

   INT. MIAMI SAFE HOUSE - TUBBS IN THE SHOWER - NIGHT

   Contemplative.  Offscreen a door opens.  Entering is Gina
   Calabrese.  She's naked.  She washes his back.  She dumps too
   much shampoo on his head.  He tries to clear it from his
   eyes.  Laughs.  They start to make love under the water, in
   the steam, through the misted glass, offscreen we hear an
   engine rumble...

   CLOSER:  GINA

   Somebody's coming.

   INT. MERCEDES - CROCKETT + TUBBS

   exchange a look.  Then they get it.  The cops work as
   security for the narcotrafficker.  The caravan advances
   towards a major intersection.  This one is blocked-off by
   Haitian military.

   EXT. SECOND CHECKPOINT - CAR DOOR

   is snatched open.  Haitian soldiers search Crockett and
   Tubbs.  They defer to the Russian-speaking security.
   Mercedes pulls forward...

   CROCKETT

   eyes his pager; Tubbs his cell phone: no signal in an urban

   carrying automatic weapons, some more casually dressed, some
   with night-vision goggles.  The vehicles stop.

   EXT. TOWN SQUARE

   Crockett and Tubbs are directed to get out.  They're pushed
   around and searched.  A working class Glaswegion Scot, a
   couple of 5'10" Brits are off to the side with short hair and
   shoulders that are too deep and faces like Rugby players (ex-
   SAS).  Russians are ex-KGB.  Languages overheard:  smatterings
   of Russian, Hebrew and English.  Crockett and Tubbs look at
   each other:  they get it.  This is the cream of private
   sector security.  And it says top dollar infrastructure.

   THEY + WE SEE:  EXT. TOWN SQUARE

   Four avenues lead in.  Each avenue is blocked.  The square is
   closed down to vehicles and pedestrians.  Locals have
   disappeared.  In the center of the square are FOUR MATCHING
   BLACK SUBURBANS.

INT. DELTA AIRPLANE - DAY

CUT TO Dave and Willcox Hillyer as the young stewardess gives
them drinks. Dave bestows a sour glance on her when he sees
the single drink, but at the moment he is in the midst of an
aggressively self-satisfied conversation and says nothing to
her. He speaks to Hillyer, who is making a real effort to be
polite but is less than happy about the encounter.

			DAVE WILKIE 
	Well, I am in the construction
	business, Buddy, and without
	braggin' I have done real good at
	it. 
		(with a meaningful
		 bitterness)
	There are those who wouldn't have
	expected that out of me. 
		(pauses as if waiting for
		 a reaction, but Hillyer
		 is very silent)
	Right now I'm buildin' a giant
	motel unit near Alexandria, outside
	Washington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm
	on the construction side.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(making polite talk)
	Well, that's interesting, Dave. I
	always liked Washington, it's a
	pretty town.

			DAVE WILKIE 
	Oh, it's all right, beats Jew York.
	But the niggers have took it over,
	just like every other city we got,
	only worse.

Hillyer gives a barely perceptible wince at this speech, but
Dave doesn't notice, he goes on with aggressive self
satisfaction after a swallow of whiskey.

			DAVE WILKIE (CONT'D)
	But I have done real good in the
	construction field. What I don't
	know about buildin' ain't worth
	knowin'. I knocked off twenty-eight
	thousand smackeroos last year,
	how's that for an old country boy?

Dave pauses, realizes this might not impress; glances down
with curiosity at the galley sheets, then an unpleasant
smile.

	Ha ha, course you make a lot more. 
		(points at the galleys)
	What's that you got there, Buddy?

ANOTHER ANGLE, on the family as they eat dinner. Rose is
seated at the table now. She is picking lifelessly at her
food and glancing from time to time with a lovesick
expression at Daddy, who is busy eating and seems wholly
unaware of it. Mother also is wholly unaware, but all the
children know what is happening. Rose takes a gravy for a
biscuit and spills a little, her hand is trembling.

	No, ma'am, I'm just fine.

	meeting of the Garden Club this
	evening.
		(to Daddy)
	I'll need the car keys.

			DADDY 
	I'll drive you, darlin'. You've got
	no business behind the wheel of an
	automobile. You don't think about
	what you're doing and you'll run
	into a telephone pole.

			MOTHER 
	I think about what I'm doing all
	the time, and I've got as much
	business behind the wheel of an
	automobile as anybody. Besides, I
	want you to stay and help Rose with
	the dishes, the poor girl isn't
	feeling well.

INT. HILLYER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Mother's bedroom-study in the moonlight. We
see Daddy lying wide-awake in a single bed staring broodingly
out into space. Mother lies asleep in a big four poster in
the background of the shot. Daddy sighs wearily to himself in
the grip of "insomnia in reverse."

INT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT BACK to Buddy and Rose in bed. He has evidently sweet
talked her into letting him fiddle with her; his hand is- in
her nightgown. There is no indication of lewd interest on
Rose's part, a peeved and exasperated look is on her face.
Buddy seems quite fascinated, however.

	Well, are you satisfied now? Can we

                    sure. Shall you do my front too?

                    I'm up for it.
          She rolls over onto her back, her young breasts straining up
          against the yellow spandex.

                              SHEENI
                    I hope you don't find it too
                    stimulating, Nick.

          He starts in on her flawless legs, gliding on the oil all the
          way within a finger's reach of her sweet apex.
          With each daring pass, he comes closer to that final split.
          Finally the hand swerves too late, and lightly grazes the
          softly yielding vee.

                              SHEENI
                    Uh, Nick. Maybe you better do the
                    top now.
          Nick moves up, lubricating her arms, shoulders and neck. He
          smooths the oil on the soft undulating foothills.

          He shakes off the last of it and zips up.

          He emerges from the woods only to find Sheeni reading his

          isn't even embarrassed.

                    your handwriting is egregious, you

                    contemplation of suicide at the

                        (taking a sensual breath)
                    It all evokes a strong emotional
                    warmth in my breast.
          Nick can only stare at her sprawled out on her back as if
          posing for a centerfold.

          manages to gain his senses.

               George stops before what used to be the offices of the 
               Building and Loan.  There is a garish electric sign over the 
               entrance reading: "Welcome Jitterbugs." A crowd of people 
               are watching the police, who are raiding the place, and 
               dragging out a number of screaming women, whom they throw 
               into a patrol wagon. George talks to one of the cops:

               Ernie's taxi cruising slowly by.

     Searching. Finds a Locker labelled `Haytham.' Opens it. Pulls
     out several shirts still in the plastic dry-cleaning sheaths:
     yellowed, permanent stains on the armpits of each.


34   INT. SAUDI NATIONAL GUARD PRISON - INTERROGATION ROOM        34

     Al-Ghazi walks back into the room with the shirts, lays them
     down on the table in front of the General -- all business.

               He's telling the truth.

     The only sound for a long, unsettled moment: Sergeant
     Haytham's labored breathing. Malik looks at the shirts, then
     Al-Ghazi, hesitates, steps away.

                         GENERAL ADBUL-MALIK
               You were injured when you used your
               vehicle to protect your country. Do
               you understand?

     Al-Ghazi moves in, begins uncuffing Haytham's bloody-raw
     wrists, hard-eyeing Malik the whole time. These men clearly
     don't like each other.


35   EXT. SAUDI NATIONAL GUARD PRISON - LATER                     35

     Al-Ghazi and Haytham sit alone. Al-Ghazi smokes. Haytham
     looks down at his feet.

                         COLONEL AL-GHAZI

      Seen from behind the Prince: everyone but Leavitt standing
      next to faces we've never seen. The table holds six gold
      serving platters. Enough food to kill a famine, tended by a
      frenzy of servants.

      Leavitt stands to the Prince's left, thick leather glove on

          It's not just one thing, it's an

          today from the Catholic Youth

          punished for his moral looseness.

          You know very well my organization

    RAY EDDY, 38, a bit worn for her years, with a long red
    ponytail, wearing an old bathrobe, sits in the passenger
    seat of her RED PLYMOUTH HORIZON with the door open,
    smoking a cigarette, thinking. Her breath is visible in
    the cold morning air.

    Her bare feet rest on the cold ground.

    Her 1970's rusted out TRAILER HOME SITS in front of her
    on CINDER BLOCKS AT A SLIGHT TILT. Beside it, a small
    SHED and behind it the CONCRETE FOUNDATION FOR A HOUSE.

    Around her, the yard is littered with junk: a rusted ski
    lift chair, the front end of a Plymouth Duster and a
    SMILING DUCK Kiddie Ride.

    Beyond the yard, flat, winterbare land.

    After a moment, a lanky boy of 15, her son, TROY, JR.,
    leans out the trailer door.

     His boss, HOYT VAUGHN (60's) sits behind a metal desk. The

     desk. A giant ashtray filled with cigarette butts. A calendar
     of booking hangs on the wall. A scribbled, jumbled mess.

               Hey Hoyt. Gary said you wanted to

               How's the comedy career? Are you a
               famous stand-up yet?

               Not quite. Haven't even performed
               yet. Just been working my material.
               This business is all about fine-
               tuning.

     Now Hoyt looks up. Takes a drag from his cigarette.
                                                         19.

          Don't sit. This will be quick.

Joker stops in his tracks.

                     HOYT
          Look, I like you, Arthur. A lot of
          the guys here, they think you're a
          freak. But I like you. I don't even

          don't say much.

          It's probably that stupid laugh. It

Unsure how to respond, Joker just nods.

          No. I got jumped. I told you about

          For a sign? Bullshit. It makes no
          sense, just give him his sign back.
          He's going out of business for
          god's--

BANG! Out of nowhere, Joker slams his head into the wall.
Head-butting it hard.

                       I went to work today. For the
                       first time in weeks. It was as if
                       I had just gotten out of college!
                       I was fearless! I went after
                       accounts I had avoided for years
                       because I thought they were out of
                       my league. I spoke to presidents,
                       vice presidents, business managers,
                       sales reps. I was amazing. I was
                       magic. But when I came home to
                       share the news with your mother, I
                       discovered her asleep. When I
                       looked around the house, I realized
                       that her "office", for lack of a
                       better word, was also piled up.
                       So, I took to the house. I have
                       made it my duty to clean this place
                       from top to bottom. Even if it

		Unfinished business.

				TEDDY
		Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you.
		Your business here is very much finished.
		You're still here because of Natalie.

				LEONARD
		Who's she?

Teddy chuckles.

Leonard looks at the house. Teddy motions towards Leonard's
pockets.

				TEDDY (cont'd)
		Take a look at your pictures, I bet you

Leonard pulls out his Polaroids and flips through them. He
pauses at the one of Natalie. Teddy SWIPES it out of his
hands to get a better look at the blurred image of Natalie
turning in a doorway.

				TEDDY (cont'd)
		Great shot, Lenny.

Teddy flips the photo over. There is nothing on the back.
Teddy hands it back to Leonard.

				TEDDY (cont'd)
		You wanna make a note that you can't

				LEONARD
		Why's that?

				TEDDY
		Because she'll have taken one look at
		your clothes and your car and started
		thinking of ways to turn the situation to
		her advantage. She's already got you
		staying with her, for fuck's sake.

		Forensics people are sure of it. You

		there?

	Hollis makes a great show of considering--

		Besides my father, I mean.

		There's no call for that, Sam. Fella

		And Buddy was one of them.

				HOLLIS
		We got that dedication tomorrow. 
		This is a hell of a time to be

				SAM
		People have worked this whole big

		built on a crime, they deserve to 
		know. Now I understand why you might 
		want to believe he couldn't do it.

				HOLLIS
		And I understand why you might want

	This is a low blow, but accurate enough to shake Sam.

				SAM
		Thanks for your time, Hollis.

	and plastic worms and shiners and frogs and spinners--

		And that was the last time you saw

	We SHIFT to see Sam sitting where Wade was headed--

				OTIS
		Oh--I think he came in one more time 
		with Hollis and--naw, your Daddy 
		wasn't with them. Made their monthly 
		pickup. Roderick wasn't in so I just 
		kept my mouth good and shut and handed 
		over that envelope.

		That was the night he disappeared?

		What was your deal with him?

	Otis smiles, chooses his words carefully--

		Buddy was more a part of the big

		chamber of commerce, zoning board if 
		I kept those people happy, he was 
		pretty much on my side.

... passing a window which features a single gem -- pausing
as horns blast O.S. and a mod blonde in a stalled sports car
motions to Joe -- she needs a push. Joe grins, glances at
himself in the window, runs a comb through his hair, then
turns back to see a cop helping the mod blonde. 

EXT. PARK AVENUE - DAY

Joe's heels drag as he walks a deserted block of luxury
apartment houses. O.S. The torchy woman's voice sings Joe's
love theme in counterpoint to the blasting horns, a siren, a
fire bell, a screech of brakes. Joe's spirits rise as he
hears the tic-tac-tic of high heels overtaking the heavy
click-clack-click of his boots. He adjusts his pace to arrive
at the corner at the same time as a smart and -- in Joe's
eyes -- very RICH LADY. Joe grins boyishly, holding his
Stetson over his heart.

			JOE
	Beg pardon, ma'am, I'm new here in
	town, just in from Houston, Texas,
	and looking for the Statue of
	Liberty.

The delicate profile gives no signs of hearing. Joe follows
her to the parkway in the middle of the avenue. There she
stops and turns, neither friendly nor hostile. 

			RICH LADY
	Were you looking? About the Statue
	of Liberty?

	Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean

	been there, but let me see, you

Hansel holds a microphone toward Joe, who shrugs, grinning at

          OFF HIS LOOK - We see APRIL, dressed stunning in a dark
          business suit at the other side of the street. She's dangling
          a WHITE SHIRT and a TIE from her other hand.

Carolyn enters, alone. She's furious. She locks the sliding
glass door and starts to pull the vertical blinds shut, then
stops. Standing very still, with the blinds casting shadows
across her face, she starts to cry: brief, staccato SOBS that
seemingly escape against her will. Suddenly she SLAPS
herself, hard.

          Weak. Baby. Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!

She SLAPS herself repeatedly until she stops crying. She
stands there, taking deep breaths until she has everything
under control, then pulls the blinds shut, once again all
business. She walks out calmly, leaving us alone in the dark,
empty room.

          You certainly do.
Erica arrives next to him, also out of breath.

          Wow. So this is what you're supposed to

Harry smiles. He's trying to be his debonair self but
something's off. He's very aware of himself. They lie there
quietly for a second when Erica begins to tear up. Harry
slowly, nervously turns to her.

Flattered, Erica snuggles up close. Harry puts his arm around
her. Then, with no warning, his eyes fill with tears.

          This is crazy. I can't remember the last

Erica pauses. Oh. That kind of overwhelmed.

Tony, a ranger, drives along a dirt road past the Fakahatchee
Strand State Preserve sign and enters the swamp. He sees the
white van and Ford parked ahead, spots a Seminole license
plate on the Ford. He pulls over down the road, and whispers
into his C.B.

          We got a Seminole, or Seminoles, in the

          east of Logging Road Twelve. I repeat,
          Indians in the swamp.

Tony waits for a response.   Nothing.

          If there are Indians in the swamp, they
          are in there for a reason.

No response. Tony glowers, gets out of the truck, watches

his cap. Mosquitoes land on his neck, his nose, his lips.

The Indians ignore him. They trudge. Laroche spots
something else, a dull green root wrapped around a tree. He
stops, circles the tree. His eyes widen in reverent awe.

     after a moment he composes himself; he has come this far.  The
     sternness returns to his eyes.  Todd is all business.  He takes

             Yeah, there were two sets of prints.  The

             troubles at home.  Rather bad troubles, I
             should think.

             I ought to run this through your chest, you
             know that?

                          DUSSANDER 
             It couldn't hurt more than a heart attack.  

     He looks at the clock - 10:15.

                          TODD 
             Christ, my parents are going to freak.  

                          DUSSANDER
             Stay calm, boy.  You are doing fine.  

     Todd dries the murder weapon and puts it away.  For a moment he
     slows down, a hint of a smile suddenly comes over him.
     Dussander sees something is different about him.  

                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)
             What are you thinking about?  

     The sound of Dussander's voice snaps Todd out of his funk.  He
     is all business again.

                          TODD
             Fuck off.  


     INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT - LATER

     Todd is back in his clothes.  He wears a white T-shirt.  He 
     brings a knife up to Dussander's neck and slices down his suit,
     still stained by Archie's blood.  

                          TODD 
             Your pants are okay.  The shoes... no.

     Todd takes off Dussander's shoes and balls them up in the
     tattered suit.  

                          TODD (CONT'D)
             Put this on.  

     He holds up Dussander's bathrobe.  The old man slips into it
     with difficulty as Todd dumps the bloodied clothing into a trash
     bag.  Dussander looks at Todd's T-shirt.

     WHIP PAN OVER TO REVEAL: A BANK ACROSS THE STREET

     As Foley goes inside, we then...

     CUT TO: A PRINTED BROCHURE THAT READS...

                        LOOKING FOR MONEY?

                  YOU'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE.

     We then PULL BACK TO REVEAL that we're now...

     INSIDE THE BANK

     as Foley stands at a counter holding the above CREDIT APPLICATION
     while he studies the bank layout.

     Foley watches a MAN IN A SUIT, carrying an attache-case, enter
     the bank and move through the gate into the fenced-off business
     area at the front.  An EXECUTIVE rises from his desk, shakes
     hands with the man and they both sit down.

     Foley rosses the brochure in the trash, then crosses to a teller
     window where a nameplate on the counter tells us the young woman
     with the pile of dark hair smiling at him is LORETTA.

                              TELLER/LORETTA
                 How can I help you, sir?

                 Loretta, you see that guy talking to
                 your manager, has his case open?

     Foley takes out a ZIPPO LIGHTER and casually, yet expertly,
     begins to fiddle with it as the teller looks across the bank.

                              LORETTA
                 That's Mr. Guindon, one of our assistant
                 managers.  Our manager is Mr. Schoen,
                 but he's not in today.

                 that party is today instead of Sunday.
                 About eight-thirty, like only a few

                 in uncut diamonds at his house.  He

                 talking on the phone.

                              MALE VOICE
                 Ask what she want with him?

                              MOSELLE
                 You ask her.  Maurice's business is
                 none of <i>my</i> business.

     Sounding tired or bored.  She turns from the door and walks
     into the living room.  Karen steps inside, pushes the door
     closed and steps into the foyer.

                              MALE VOICE
                 How do I know?

     Karen peers into a study, a small room with empty bookcases and
     sees Kenneth in his backward red baseball cap as he talks on
     the phone...

                              KENNETH
                 The State, huh.  Who's fighting?

     Karen walks into the living room, where Moselle sits on the sofa
     lighting a cigarette.

                              MOSELLE
                 You like to sit down?

                              KAREN
                 Thanks.

     Karen takes a chair and looks around the room: dismal, gray
     daylight in the windows, dark wood and white stucco, the
     fireplace full of trash, plastic cups, wrappers, a pizza box.

                 Maybe we'll see each other again, okay?

     She steps aside and brushes past him.  He grabs her left wrist...

                              KENNETH
                 We gonna tussle first.

     Karen flicks the baton and sixteen inches of chrome steel shoots
     out of the grip.  She pulls an arm's length away from him and
     chops the rigid shaft at his head, Kenneth hunching, ducking
     away...

                              KENNETH (CONT'D)
                 God <i>damn</i>...

     He lets go of her and Karen gets the room she needs, so that
     when he comes at her, she whips the shaft across the side of
     his head and he howls, stops dead, presses a hand over his ear.

                              KENNETH (CONT'D)
                 What's wrong with you?

     And she walks out.  She sees Moselle standing there in the foyer.
     Karen looks at her a moment, puts the baton in her purse and
     comes out with a business card.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 I wrote my hotel number on there -- in

          weighed down by both their bags.
          Up ahead at the gate, a GATE ATTENDANT (Female, 50's) ANNOUNCES
          final boarding to Sitka.   Margaret gets off her phone.

          So what do I need to know up there?   Bullet

          I told ‘em we've been dating for six months.
          We've kept it a secret from everyone...
          (under his breath)
          ...and that you're a naughty minx in the

          Yeah.   I miss it.   Believe me, growing up I
          never thought I'd end up divorced and back
          here teaching at my old elementary school.

          No.   I was going to teach, he was going to

          I wish it wasn't my business.   But

          because I made a deal with someone I thought

          You wanna know why you're here?   I'll show

          Some of this seems quite like hypnosis,
          is it not?

                         MASTER
          Oh no, this is funny. It's quite the
          reverse. Man is hypnotized. What we do is
          un-hypnotize him of the shackles. Allow
          him to raise his awareness and IQ.

                         JOHN MORE
          What is the difference between this and
          psychotherapy?

                         MASTER
          Yes. Well. They are very different. No.
          Psychoanalysis, they lay back. No, no,
          no. Don't associate us with such people!
          That's terrible (he, he) why that's a bad
          manner don't you know? I mean at that
          business about sex and all that. That's
          for the neurotic or the person who is
          insane or something like that. That's
          nothing to do with us. They've failed.
          That's for the fortunate few who can
          afford the fees.

                         JOHN MORE
          But some of this does in fact seem to
          share quite a lot with Dr. Freud and
          modern psychotherapy, does it not?

                         MASTER
          No it does not. This is an exact science,
          you see. Comparable to physics or
          chemistry - but simpler. It's
          engineering. Herr Freud had his chance
          and contributed some very workable data,
          but in the end, he failed. So that's
          that.

                         JOHN MORE
          And how long does this take?

                         MASTER
          That depends. But it can be quite fast.
          Quite fast. Or it can take some time.
          Sometimes less than 36 hours.

An imposing figure rises and makes his way to the front of
the assembly.  He's COLONEL HARRY LEE, about Marion's age
and cut from the same cloth -- strong, weathered, with a
powerful bearing.  The room quiets down.

Lee sees Marion and offers a familiar nod, which Marion
returns, stone-faced.  Then Lee speaks, simply and
clearly.

				LEE
		You all know why I am here.  I am
		not an orator and I will not try to
		convince you of the worthiness of
		our cause.  I am a soldier and we
		are at war and with the declaration
		of independence we all expect from
		Philadelphia, it will soon be a
		formal state of war.  In preparation
		for that, eight of the thirteen
		colonies have levied money in
		support of a Continental Army.  I
		ask South Carolina to be the ninth.

		Colonel Lee, Massachusetts may be at
		war, along with New Hampshire and
		Rhode Island and Virginia, but South
		Carolina is not at war.

				LEE
		Massachusetts and New Hampshire are
		not as far from South Carolina as
		you might think and the war they're
		fighting is not for independence of
		one or two colonies.  It's for the
		independence of a nation.

Marion salutes Cornwallis who doesn't return the salute.

THEN MARION TURNS TO TARLETON.  He walks up to him and
looks him in the eye.

				MARION
		You don't remember me, do you?

Tarleton examines Marion's face, finding him familiar, but
unable to place him... then Tarleton remembers...

		Ah, yes, that boy.

Tarleton calmly holds Marion's glare.

				TARLETON
		Ugly business, doing one's duty.

				MARION
		Yes, ugly business.

Marion takes a step closer to Tarleton, then speaks very
softly, very slowly, very clearly.

				MARION
		If you are alive when this war is
		over, I'm going to kill you.

Marion locks his eyes on Tarleton to make it perfectly
clear that he means what he says.  Tarleton tries to cover
his reaction but it's apparent that he's taken aback by
Marion's icy words.

Marion turns and walks out.  The two Great Danes start to
follow, but Cornwallis SNAPS A COMMAND:

Redcoats glare at Marion who sits, mounted, waiting.  His
eighteen men are led out of the prison blockhouse and
directed to waiting horses.  Surprised to be freed, they
mount up.

CORNWALLIS AND TARLETON step out onto the front porch of
Cornwallis' headquarters and watch as Marion and his men
ride toward the gate.

THE TWO GREAT DANES, watch Marion from Cornwallis' side.

Cornwallis motions to the Redcoat Sentries to OPEN THE
GATES.  They do so and Marion and his men, without
hurrying, ride out.

Then, just as the gates are closing behind him, Marion,
without turning around, lets loose with a PIERCING

          hunting, are we?
              (off Dido's disdain)
          Good Lord, I forgot - you have
          ensnared my brother. Now is he to
          share his dining room with you, as
          well as his bed??
His words bury deep and painful.

                    DIDO
          Oh, Mr James, your manners are as
          poor as your brother's finances.

               I'm not supposed to smoke any more, among other things.  It's 
               bad for my condition.  So before I die, did you do anything other 
               than the sports phone in Vegas?  
 
                                     BRANDON
               Just the 900 number recordings, it was full time, I mean we got 
               10 bucks a call.
 
                                     WALTER
               Chump change, Brandon.  We're angling for bigger fish here.  
               You see, the networks don't talk about it and Uncle Sam can't 
               tax it, but sports gambling is a 200-billion-dollar-a-year-business. 
                These gamblers have needs, Brandon.  Come Monday morning, after 
               a losing weekend, a lot of them have big needs.   
 
               WALTER presses a button and the TVS fill with football games. 
               
 
                                     WALTER
               That's every pro game played last Sunday.

               Do you know why Monday Night's the most watched game of the week? 
                It's because Monday's the last chance bettors have to climb 
               out of the hole before paying their bookies on Tuesday.  Sports 
               betting's illegal in 49 states, including this one, but what 
               we do is 100% legal -- it's exactly the same as a stock broker, 
               only instead of touting stocks, we advise people on how to bet. 
                We make the big money off our client list.  You see, when a 
               client wins with our advice we take a percentage, which they 
               gladly give to keep getting our picks.  When they lose we get 
               zip.  So the object here, my tall, athletic, religious friend 
               -- is to win.

Allen shakes his head no. Bill turns off the gas. Offers a
joint to Allen.

instruments. POLICEMEN escort a businessman and another
gentleman out of the bathroom, in HANDCUFFS. The mood in the
bar chills.

group has decided to buy the entire
complex and turn them into rentals. In
retrospect I must admit we made one big
mistake.

Everyone hangs on his every word.

SALES MANAGER
We should have asked for more money.

The entire room laughs. Mr. Daniels stands up.

MR. DANIELS
I just want to put this out there,
Stevey. You did it bro. You laid your
cajones, and mine, out on the table, and
you slam dunked it. Way to go.
(nervously jokes)
Now watch, they'll kick you upstairs
ahead of me. All right, in other
business�

As Mr. Daniels speaks, Joan tries to get Steven's attention from a crack in the door.

JOAN
(quietly)
Pssst. Steven.

Steven turns and sees her. She waves for him to come to her. He waves her off.

JOAN
(more urgently-quietly)
I really need to speak with you.

Some people are beginning to notice this exchange.

STEVEN
(curtly)
It can wait.

Right then two POLICE OFFICERS storm into the room. Joan stands behind them looking 
concerned.

POLICE OFFICER
Is there a Steven Bartowsky here?

Yes. But he can't speak. He's in shock.

113	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Steven enters the room. The camera pulls back to reveal Rick laying in full traction, face down, his 
rear end heavily bandaged. He is unconscious.

Steven tentatively walks over to Rick's rear end. He pulls back a small portion of the bandage and 
sees that his butt is covered with staples. The staples form the shape of a television with an 
antenna. Inside the TV is the word "RING."

STEVE
(perplexed)
Ring?

The phone rings. Steven jumps, then picks up the phone.

STEVEN
Hello.

CABLE GUY (VO)
Poor Rick. Seems he had a little
accident with the business end of a
staple gun.

(Revision Ends - Blue)

STEVEN
You're not going to get away with this.

CABLE GUY
The question is, are you going to get
away with it? Apparently there was an
anonymous tip placed to the police
leading them to a staple gun at the crime
scene with your fingerprints all over it.

ROBIN
(VO)
All right, I'm ready.

something off the rug.  Leaklight from the staircase dims

                    OK. There was this guy who worked in my

                    fifteen years to a nice lady. And then
                    he meets this woman at some church event.
                    And he told my dad he just had never felt
                    anything like it before. I mean, he had
                    finally met the love of his life. So, he
                    divorced his wife, and he's been with
                    this other woman for 22 years and they
                    are blissfully happy. I mean, what if

                    already married someone else? Are you

                         Oh, this is "good business" in your 
                         opinion. You've got to move them, 
                         the equipment, everything to 
                         Czechoslovakia -- it doesn't make

                         familiar with them. It's good for 
                         you -- you'll be compensated. It's 
                         good for the Army. You know what I'm

	INT. REC ROOM - DAY
	
	CLOSE UP on Karl's face. Charles has started another
	monologue.
	
	                    CHARLES 
	          There was a young man named John
	          Liggit Hunter who was in the
	          filling station business and a good
	          filling station business. He was
	          one of those young men that we run
	          across so often in life. I'm sure
	          you've run across them, that didn't
	          deserve the things he had. One of
	          those things was his beautiful
	          bride, Sarah. She was a Georgia
	          Peach. As a matter of fact she
	          looked more like the picture I've
	          had in my head than any woman I've
	          ever seen. I took it upon myself to
	          take her away from John Liggit
	          Hunter, who didn't deserve her. I'm
	          not sure if I mentioned that he was
	          a Frenchman who claimed to be an
	          Englishman. It took some very
	          strong nylon cord to take her away
	          from him. She was a fighter as well
	          as a Georgia Peach.

               INT. A FLORIST SHOP - DAY

               A long white box is being filled with red roses. We HEAR the 
               FLORIST'S VOICE.

                                     FLORIST'S VOICE
                         Red roses. Very romantic. The man 
                         who sends these knows what he's doing.

               Now WE SEE Loretta tabulating and the Florist working on the 
               box of roses.

                         The man who sends those spends a lot 
                         of money on something that ends up 
                         in the garbage can.

               The Florist gives her a look and then smiles.

                                     FLORIST
                         I'm glad everybody ain't like you, 
                         Loretta. I'd be outta business.

                                     LORETTA
                         Without me, you'd be out of business. 
                         I like flowers.

               She gives him a sudden, brief, blinding smile. It's the first 
               time we've seen her smile. She has gold work around one of 
               her two front teeth. The Florist grunts and hands her a red 
               rose. Camera moves close to Loretta and the rose.

	He pulls his shirt over his head and walks around like a

     title resonates.  Lowell turns to the window, casually
     looking into the early evening...and he comes face to face
     with what Wigand was staring at, The Brown &amp; Williamson
     Tobacco Company Headquarters Building, lit up right across

     And we enter mid-scene on Jeffrey in a more formal demeanor,
     sitting in a chair, Mike Wallace sitting across from him,
     under the lights, taping an interview.  Lowell, off camera.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               You heard Mr. Sandefur say before
               Congress that he <u>believed</u> nicotine was
               <u>not</u> addictive...?

                         WIGAND
                   (nods)
               ...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured
               himself because I watched those
               testimonies very carefully.

     Lowell's reaction.  Jeffrey's statements are stunning and
     powerful revelations...and dangerous ones to make.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               All of us did.  There was this whole <u>line</u>
               of people...whole line of CEOs up there
               all swearing.

                         WIGAND
               Part of the reason I'm here is I felt
               that their representation clearly
               misstated, at least within Brown &amp;
               Williamson's representation, clearly
               <u>misstated</u>...what is common language
               within the company...we are in the
               nicotine delivery business.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               And that's what cigarettes are for...?

               A delivery device for nicotine.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               A delivery device for nicotine.  Put it
               in your mouth, light it up, and you're
               gonna get your fix...

           The union provides a handgun and a
           permit to every one of the drivers.
           And they think this whole thing is
           over in a week.
                         
                          ABEL
           These men are fucking truck
           drivers. This is insane. You know
           who is gonna get it in the end
           here, me. This comes back to me.

           Grandfather was able to communicate
           to you how much I have always
           respected him. And it was only out
           of respect for the business he had
           built, and because I knew of his
           reservations and feelings about
           your uncles and your father that I
           made those offers.

          ABEL comes out and we see ANNA standing outside the trailer
          in the cold because these guys don't do business with women.
          He hands her the document. Under her breath:
                         
                          ANNA
           These fucking guys...what's this
           additional $11,000?

           So... I should tell you that I
           won't be able to take that deal you
           offered. There is no way I would
           ever accept a felony charge for
           anything we've done.
                         
           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
           I know.

           That's probably true.
                         
                          ABEL
           But I also can't have you digging
           around my life and keeping this
           hanging around my neck for the next
           ten years. I love fighting a good
           battle but this... it's very bad
           for my business.

ANGLE, on Scott, as he steps away. He takes us through the
Whorehouse. In the adjacent room we see a bank of video
monitors, showing people in various sexual activities. On
the screen for a moment comes the face of what looks like a
very young girl indeed, camera swerves onto the face of the
Businessman we saw outside the Whorehouse, he is disrobing,...

is seated in a chair, presided over by several agents,
forced to watch the video. He turns his head away.

tries to stop him. He shoves her roughly back into the
elevator. Several of the men come toward Scott, and a large,
portly businessman in his forties (AVI) calls them off.
Scott comes forward.

A beat.

Proximo suddenly begins to weep rather histrionically --

flicks tears from his eyes -- and then can't keep the show
up -- he bursts into laughter.

Maximus stares at him.

          nibbles, from a couple labels.

Jerry pauses a beat, finding the best response.

          Here's the thing. You guys can make
          a real record. Sell it nationwide.
          But we're not there yet. These
          labels, they're still gonna need
          some... convincing. So I invited a
          few of them to your show. So you
          have to kick ass tonight. Can you
          do that?

The guys stare back at Jerry, with the fire in their eyes.
Goddamn right they can do it -- "Hell yeah!"

     TOOSIE, A WOMAN IN HER LATE 50'S RADIATING A TOUGHNESS OF PRIOR
     GENERATIONS, enters the apartment in a business-like manner with
     MONGO, A SMALL, DISTRACTED AND OBVIOUSLY HANDICAPPED CHILD.
     Toosie has a bag of groceries in her other arm.

     they've just woken up. Mary attempts to put on her wig and
     make up.

     television, and then hands the groceries to Precious, who
     takes them directly to the kitchen as Toosie leaves without a
     word.

      Precious doesn't answer.

                          MS. RAIN
                Because you love her...as much as
                she loves you.

      Precious looks to her side and finds Rita smiling
      reassuringly through her crooked teeth.

                           MS. RAIN
                Now the rest of the world can judge
                you, cheat you, beat you, dismiss
                you and abandon you all it wants
                but we won't let you give up and
                that's the only thing that matters.
                Some people have less than that on
                their side and still manage to keep

      Precious thinks a long moment, wipes her face and exhales.
      She doesn't move for what seems like ages.

      The whole class watches her until Ms. Rain motions for them
      to continue working. Finally, Precious takes hold of her pen,
      opens her journal, sighs deeply and starts to write again.

          PAN with him as he sits, opens an organic chemistry text. The
          doors close. The train starts up, but the Jewish boy hardly
          notices; he is already reading. He sways with the motion of
          the car, half-hidden by other passengers. We realize he is
          being watched.

          his nose, wipes the nose with a handkerchief, puts the
          handkerchief away, and all the time his eyes have not left
          the page. Suede-head steps between passengers and stands
          directly over the Jewish boy. He looks down at the yarmulke
          pinned to the stiff, wavy hair, at the oversized shirt
          collar, scrawny neck, prominent Adam's apple, pimples,
          dandruff, ingrown facial hair...
          
          He steps closer, crowding the boy's knees. The boy shifts a

          head pursues him along the bench until, unable to slide
          farther, the boy flattens his legs against the seat. Suede-
          head presses into the boy's knees.
          
          The boy accidentally bumps a BUSINESSMAN to Suede-head's
          left. The man (late 30s, Wall Street Journal, African-

          at once what is going on.
          
          Suede-head stares right back -- and the BUSINESSMAN returns

          and I have asked Connex's
          Washington counsel, Sydney Hewitt,
          to come down here and talk about
          strategy for the next thirty days.
          The eyes all shift to SYDNEY HEWITT,. 60's, Alabama smooth
          accent and ever-so-certain.

                         SYDNEY
          In a way I feel like Switzerland
          and I'd like to remind everyone in
          this room that they've signed
          confidentiality agreements.
          Polite LAUGHTER.

                         SYDNEY (CONT'D)
          And allow me to introduce my
          associate, Bennett Holiday, who
          will be, how should I put it,
          building consensus day to day.
          Bennett, the only African-American in the room, takes in
          the faces now all staring at him. All the white faces.

          18 INT. PLANE - DAY 18

          Business Class cabin. Bennett looks out the window. His
          POV of clouds and farmland and the Mississippi River.
          Sydney emerges from First with a scotch and sits.

                         SYDNEY
          You just visited what someday soon
          could be the most profitable
          corporation in America.

                         BENNETT
          Provided the government approves
          the merger --

                         SYDNEY
          Provided we don't start running
          cars on water. Provided there's
          still chaos in the Middle-East.

           Look for names.  Does it say whose taxes

           I don't see any people names.  It's all

           Yeah!  Here's a name.  This is somebody's

All three men are sucking air like freight engines.  No
one is shooting, but if one person fires, everyone will fire.
Everybody has something the other guy wants.  That's the only
thing holding them back --

           You said they would be here, goddamnit!
           Where are they?

Howell releases his grip on the gun, and lets it swing free
on his finger.  He's trying to cool Talley --

                     HOWELL
           They're close.  Let me make a call.  You
           can see they're okay.

of the Fat Man and he won't put down his pistol.  Howell
carefully holds the phone to Talley's ear --

     Now I think you understand that we

     essential to the smooth functioning

     Sure.     Sure.

     And that without these rules, we really

            are permitted on our premises. And
            that's why I'm asking you, Mr. Pupkin,
            to cooperate with us.

LANGFORD is seated on a chair whose back is pressed right
up against the high, ornate brass bedstead at the foot of
the bed. MARSHA trains the gun on LANGFORD now. PUPKIN
is unpacking a suitcase. He takes out a handsome blue suit,
ruffled shirt, a bow tie, black shoes, underwear, socks,
shaving equipment, soap, a hairbrush, a clothesbrush, a
small shoe shine kit, aftershave lotion, deodorant and a
dozen or so rolls of inch-and-a-half wide adhesive tape.
He removes this stuff from a suitcase that is barely big
enough to hold it -- so the mere packing of all this para-
phernalia into such a small space represents something of an
achievement. As he takes the stuff out, he talks to
LANGFORD, his back turned to him.

                 PUPKIN
     This wasn't an easy decision for
     me, Jerry, believe me. For one
     thing, I knew it meant we could never
     be friends again and that hurt me.
     It's hard to lose a friend, even one
     who has let you down. You always
     hope you can patch things up. You
     know, a guy like me doesn't make
     friends that easily.

          installed.

           Tomorrow night we explore the excesses
           of hedge fund managers.

          massive mansions, expensive watches and wines.

           Whether they're spraying $5000 a
           bottle champagne at Voile Rouge in
           Saint-Tropez, ordering a $10,000
           Martini at The Algonquian Hotel with a
           diamond on the bottom or eating a gold
           dusted $175 hamburger at the Wall
           Street Burger Shoppe...
          Now the flashes are of some of the top HEDGE FUND MANAGERS in
          the business that we'll see later... one of them is a man
          named BRETTON WOODS... maybe we hold a little longer on him

          A large space lined with long desks that hold five TRADERS

           basically got me my scholarship to
           Yale then hired me right out of

          top circumference of the whole office... similar to the one
          Andrew Zabel had.

           BRETTON WOODS (V.O.)
           Okay. Then I want you to build
           positions in your favorite three
           names.
          Jacob picks up the phone and...

          THE SCREEN SPLITS IN TWO
          With Jacob on top and Robby on the bottom.
          As Robby takes the order and starts typing into his
          Bloomberg...

           BRETTON WOODS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           I want you stealth. Use all six
           trading desks we're in business with.

          NOW ROBBY'S HALF OF THE SCREEN SPLITS INTO 6 SMALL BOXES

           80.

                         

                         
          Six different trading desks... six different BROKERS taking
          calls from Jacob who still owns the whole top half of the
          screen.

           BRETTON WOODS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           And if they go down... we increase our
           size.

          AND BACK TO JACOB
          Leaning back... feet on desk... staring at the ticker...
          which only has three stocks on it...

      cooking, an apron tied like a bath towel around his waist.

              So how come you talk like you do?  I mean, cursing

              It's a disease.  It's called Tourette Syndrome.  I can't
              control what I say.  Turnip.

          Someday I'm gonna get married and I'm
          going to need all this stuff. When
          you get married, you need everything
          there is.

Donna slips out of her leather jacket, tosses it on a pile of
jackets, and pads into the kitchen. Arctor follows her,
tiptoeing along the paper.

                       BOB ARCTOR
          How much of what you've got did you
          buy and how much did you steal?

                        DONNA HAWTHORNE
          Buy?   What do you mean "buy"?

Donna opens a cabinet, reaches in back, pulls out several
plastic bags of pills. She lays them on the counter, opens
a drawer, pulls out a pipe and some hash, sits at the table
and fills the pipe. Arctor lays money on the table.

                       BOB ARCTOR
          Like when you buy dope. Like a dope
          deal. When I mean by "buy" is an
          extension into the greater world of
          business transactions of what we have
          present now, with us, as dope deals.

                       BOB ARCTOR
          He choked to death alone, in his room,
          on a piece of meat. No one heard him.

                       OLD LADY
          You know, Mr. Arctor, more deaths
          happen from that than people realize.
          I read that if you're dining with a
          friend and he doesn't talk for a long
          time, you should ask him if he can,
          beacuse he may be strangling.

                       BOB ARCTOR
          Yes. That's true. Thanks.      And
          thanks about the check.

                       OLD LADY
          Well, I'm sorry about your friend.

Travis's yellow taxi pulls in foreground. On left rear door
are lettered the words "Dependable Taxi Service".

We are somewhere on the upper fifties on Fifth Ave. The rain
has not let up.

An ELDERLY WOMAN climbs in the right rear door, crushing her
umbrella.  Travis waits a moment, then pulls away from the
curb with a start.

Later, we see Travis' taxi speeding down the rain-slicked
avenue. The action is periodically accompanied by Travis'
narration. He is reading from a haphazard personal diary.

            Thank you, Travis.

Travis nods, turns and exits.

Tom, who has been watching this interchange with a pseudo-
standoffish (actually jealous) air, steps over to Betsy. His
manner demands some sort of explanation of what Betsy was
doing.

Betsy simply shrugs (it's really none of his business) and
says:

                         BETSY
            I'm just going to find out what the
            cabbies are thinking.

INT. COFFEE SHOP

Travis and Betsy are sitting in a booth of a small New York
Coffee Shop. They both have been served coffee; Travis is
nervously turning his cup around in his hands.

As Travis speaks V.O., WAITRESS brings their orders: Apple
pie for TRAVIS, fruit compote for BETSY.

               No problem. Thanks for letting me 
               crash. It was the best sleep I've 
               had in months. I used some of your

                Mr. Boloshevski was ultimately
                charged twenty-four hundred
                dollars for labor, which according
                to our figures is about the average
                cost of an aluminum siding job.

                              MASTERS
                Twenty-four hundred dollars that
                you charged for labor, is the same
                as if Mr. Boloshevski had purchased
                the aluminum siding and had the
                labor done.

                Maybe I'm missing the point here,
                but if he paid twenty-four hundred,
                which is the cost of the job, I
                can't see anything wrong with that.
                I don't know the guy, but I don't
                quite get the problem.

28. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

Lula is standing in the bathroom of their room at the Hotel fooling with 
her hair in front of the mirror.  Sailor can see her through the doorway 
from where he lays on the bed.

				LULA
		Sailor, you are somethin� else,

		startin� to think about sex, and
		I should talk to her before I did
		anything about it.

		But honey, I thought you told me
		your Uncle Pooch raped you when
		you was thirteen.

				LULA
		That�s true.  Uncle Pooch wasn�t
		really an uncle.  He was a business
		partner of my daddy�s?  And my mama
		never knew nothin� about me and 
		him - that�s for damn sure.  His real
		name was somethin� kind of European,
		like Pucinski.  But everyone just
		called him Pooch.  He came around the
		house sometimes when Daddy was away.
		I always figured he was sweet on 
		mama, so when he cornered me one 
		afternoon, I was surprised more�n
		a little.

				SAILOR
		How�d it happen, peanut?  He just
		pull out the old toad and let it
		croak?

Lula brushes away her bangs and frowns.  She takes a cigarette from the 
pack on the sink and lights it, then lets it dangle from her lips while 
she teases her hair.

				LULA
		You�re terrible crude sometimes, 
		Sailor, you know?

				SAILOR
		I can�t hardly understand you when
		you talk with one of them Mores in
		your mouth.

Lula takes a long, slow drag on her More and sets it down on the edge of 
the sink.

the hall.  He carefully, almost losing his balance, places his drink 
outside the MEN�S ROOM and enters.  Marietta standing down at the other

     Betty pulls the door shut and bends over to lock it.  Clay
     catches a glimpse of skin in the side slit of her shirttail.

                    and talk.  I really feel like
                    talking tonight.

     Betty's eyes blink in mock surprise.

                    person I expected to meet when I
                    moved out here.  Someone who's done

                    interested in this old goober than
                    you ever were in me?

                    by the way you have no business
                    calling him a homo.

               A dishevelled WOMAN in a business suit (27) runs down a lonely 
               highway in Texas hill country, moving desperately through 
               the thick morning fog. She's carrying a VHS cassette. The 
               sounds of her breathing and SHOES HITTING the PAVEMENT ECHO 
               into the mist.

               She runs, and runs.

               She slows, out-of-strength, looks up and down the highway.

               Both in front and behind, it leads straight into the mist, a 
               tunnel of fog. She stumbles on, a final effort.

               She runs. Sees something. Stops cold.

There is a scattering of laughter -- almost by rote -- as
Sharon enters her car without even the hint of a smile.
Robby notices. She just punches up the CAD monitor, all
business. Our TRUMPET MUSIC comes in, aching now, and
takes us into...


INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

She is exercising on the machine, sliding into her
crunches, fast and furious, but all the pain and sorrow
is in her eyes, and in a moment she just stops. The
TRUMPET MUSIC KEEPS GOING ON through this. She looks
over at the phone.


INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

We PAN OVER Bob-the-Dog, watching something. We see a
few scattered sheets of music lying about, hearing
RUSTLING, and we ARRIVE AT Catch, seated on the floor,
shuffling through a stack of sheet music, driven, looking
for something. The PHONE RINGS. He ignores it. He is
opening up each chart of music, shaking it out,
searching.

Sharon's voice comes on his machine, almost hollow with
sorrow.

                         SHARON (V.O.)
          Catch.  Can you... pick up?
                 (pause)
          Will you call me?

He keeps searching, seeming to not even    listen. The
MACHINE CLICKS OFF. He shakes the next     music chart and
something falls out. He stares at this     piece of paper,
picks it up, slowly turns it over. It     is a picture of
himself, a man blowing a horn, drawn in    crayon by a four
or five-year-old. Catch stares at this     with a depth that
goes on forever, as the MUSIC ENDS.

                         DOOR:

                         BRADY
          Wait a minute.
          Hagen turns back. Brady comes up with the Genco Inte.r-
          national loan application.

                         BRADY
          Take this along with you in case
          you run out of toilet paper on
          0 the flight back to Vegas.
          3agen takes the application from Brady, then cuietly:
          E ,Gr 3
          Don't ever think that the Corleone
          Tamily is finished, Mister Brady.
          That would be a mistake.
          Hagen and Neri now turn and exit. Brady is looking
          after them. Gradually the bravado drains from his
          big, pink, Irish face and he crosses to the telephone
          and picks it up.

-- upturns the bottle and begins to chug the tequila.

Charlie tries to yank the bottle away, but Kate holds on
tight. With the bottle at Kate's lips -- and tequila pouring
down her chin -- the couple wrestles for control of the
bottle.

               Congratulations Phillip, scared off
               another one.

     A few moments later, he's startled by the CLANG of his
     cell door sliding open.

     He looks up - a CORRECTIONS OFFICER stands over him.

                            CORRECTIONS OFFICER
               Morris - you got a new roommate.

     This is no consolation to Phillip. He heaves a heavy sigh
     until he sees STEVEN enter his cell, clutching a pile of
     belongings.

     Phillip is overwhelmed as the cell door slams shut behind
     Steven.

                            PHILLIP
               Oh my God. How the hell did you do this?

     Steven slowly moves closer.

                            STEVEN
               I know a guy. I took care of it.   I'm
               gonna take care of everything...

     Steven gently caresses Phillip's face. Phillip is
     melting. Then suddenly, Phillip grabs Steven's ass.

                            PHILLIP
               Enough romance, let's fuck.

     They launch themselves onto the bunk and as they get to

       AUTUMN LEAVES fall as Charlotte walks onto the running track
       with the three dogs on leashes. She starts to run --
       tentative -- slowly. They trot along with her.

       Charlotte runs faster - more confident. The dogs run along
       with her -- they are wearing Burberry pet sweaters.

                hanging around the hospital waiting
                room hoping to see you. I swear
                every time he heard someone in

                I know it is -- and you have every
                right to never call him -- but I'm
                just a big pile of love today --and
                I feel bad for the guy. He said
                he's been writing you -- but you
                never responded.

      CRANE DOWN from a view of Paris on a misty day.   Cool,
      gray and beautiful.
      
      A taxi stops by the curb of a wide, cobbled street. All
      around there is bustle and activity, with cars and people
      hurrying about their business.
      
      The door opens and a pair of exquisitely shaped female

      CARA MASON (30, stunning) shows no sign of noticing. She

      attention. He's busy scanning his emails on his
      Blackberry.
      
      Knock, knock. A thick-necked BODYGUARD in the background
      goes to answer the door. A moment later...
      
      He ushers in Quinn, the Swiss Interpol agent.

      Demidov swirls his glass.

                You know I'd never admit this at

                There's much we could learn from

      The Old Neighbor nods as Cara walks out the door.
      
      He admires Cara's shapely form as she crosses the

	A duffel bag is unzipped, revealing bricks and bricks of
	cocaine.  Each marked with a "P."  A knife punctures one of
	the bricks.  A mound of white powder is brought up to a man's
	nose.  It's George who samples, and then it is sampled by the
	man he is doing business with.  The shot widens TO REVEAL all

	INT. HOLIDAY MOTEL - LITTLE HAVANA - 1978 - DAY

	Diego puts a straw in his nose and snorts a big gakker.  His
	eyes are wide, his pupils dilated, and a weapon sticks out of
	the back of his pants.  He knocks the dust off his nose
	before moving outside.  George is on the porch, smoking a
	cigarette.

				DIEGO
		Three years.  How long have we been in
		business?  Three years.  Does she get to
		meet your connection?  Was she good
		enough?

				GEORGE
		Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be
		here any minute.  I'm trying to
		concentrate.

				DIEGO
		I'm very angry with you, George.  Very
		angry.  You don't take me to California,
		but you take your bitch wife?  A woman?
		I understand you love her, but it was
		you and me who started this.  You and
		me.

				GEORGE
		What do you need my connection for,
		Diego?  What are you going to do with
		it?

				DIEGO
		What do I do with it?  Nothing.  It's
		for peace of mind.  It's for the
		principle.

	George doesn't have time for this.  He checks the cylinders
	on his weapon and runs over possible scenarios in his mind.
	But Diego won't get off the soap box.

      S a n g e r just looks at her. Then jolts from a spasm, clawing at
      his chest. His knees buckling, he topples against a display
      case. Pawing at the glass, he slides dreadfully to the ground.

      The tour group keeps their distance, unsettled by the face of
      mortality. Sanger is now lying in contortion on the floor, his
      gaping eyes fixed on the display tank. The embryo in mutated

      little human monster is one that will follow him to the grave.

			MICHAEL
		   (good-humoredly)
	Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make
	you used to our ways, or adopt
	English ones.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	It's not the English way, for ladies
	to have two lovers, and, so, Mr.
	Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the
	sum you owe me, and I resign all
	claims to this young lady.  If she
	has a fancy for school-boys, let her
	take 'em, sir.

			MICHAEL
	Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	I never was more in earnest.

Best exits.

			MICHAEL
		   (in a towering rage)
	You -- you!  Hang you for a meddling
	brat, your hand is in everybody's
	pie.  What business had you to come
	brawling and quarreling here, with
	a gentleman who has fifteen hundred
	a-year?

Michael runs after Best.

		   (gasps)
	Oh, I shall die; I know I shall.  I
	shall never leave this spot.

	The Captain is gone.

Dorothy, giving him an indignant look, jumps up and walks
towards the house.

	This is a pretty way to recommend
	yourself to the family.

	Oh, yes!  Dead lame.

Harry comes up to shake Roderick by the hand, while
Captain Best takes off his hat, and turns extremely red.

	And very lucky for you, Roderick, my
	boy.  You were a dead man else, for

	A regular Turk.  I never yet knew

	Hang the business.  I hate it.  I'm
	ashamed of it.  Say you're sorry,
	Roderick.  You can easily say that.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	If the young feller will go to
	Dublin, as proposed...

			RODERICK
	I'm not sorry -- I'll not apologize
	-- and I'll as soon go to Dublin as
	to hell!

Grogan takes him aside.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is
	silly business.  The girl will marry
	Best, mark my words; and as sure as
	she does, you'll forget her.  You
	are but a boy.  Best is willing to
	consider you as such.  Dublin's a
	fine place, and if you have a mind
	to take a ride thither and see the
	town for a month, here are twenty
	guineas at your service.  Make Best
	an apology, and be off.

			RODERICK
	A man of honor dies, but never
	apologizes.  I'll see the captain
	hanged before I apologize.

retire to one side, and Harry gives the signal.

It is slowly given, and Roderick has the leisure to cover
his man well.

Captain Best changes color and trembles as the numbers are
given.

At "three" both pistols go off.  Best gives a most
horrible groan, staggers backwards and falls.

Laying open his coat, blood is seen gurgling from under
his gorget.

	How is it with you?

The unfortunate man does not answer, but when the support
of Harry's arm is withdrawn from his back, groans once
more and falls backwards.

			MICHAEL
		   (with a scowl)
	The young fellow has begun well.
	You had better ride off, young sir,
	before the police are up.  They had
	wind of the business before we left
	Kilwangan.

			RODERICK
	Is he quite dead?

			MICHAEL
	Quite dead.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Then the world's rid of a coward.
	It's all over with him, Roddy -- he
	doesn't stir.

He gives the huge prostrate body a scornful kick with his
foot.

			HARRY
	We are not cowards, Grogan, whatever
	he was!  Let's get the boy off as
	quick as we may.  Your man shall go
	for a cart, and take away the body
	of this unhappy gentleman.  This has
	been a sad day's work for our
	family, Roderick James, and you have
	robbed us of fifteen-hundred a-year.

EXT.  ROAD TO DUBLIN - DAY

A well-armed gentleman dressed in green, and a gold cord,
with a patch on his eye, and riding a powerful mare, puts
his horse alongside.

			ARMED GENTLEMAN
	Good day to you, young sir.

			RODERICK
	Good morning.

	Where are you bound for?

	Is your mother not afraid on account
	of the highwayman to let one so

	Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of
	good pistols that have already done
	execution, and are ready to do it
	again.

At this, a pock-marked man coming up, the well-armed
gentleman spurs into his bay mare, and leaves Roderick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	A little later on, as I rode towards
	Kilcullen, I saw a crowd of peasant
	people assembled round a one-horse
	chair, and my friend in green, as I
	thought, making off half-a-mile up
	the hill.

A footman howls, at the top of his voice.

			RODERICK
	What is this noise, fellows?

Roderick rides up amongst them, and seeing the lady in the
carriage, very pale and frightened, gives a slash of his
whip, and bids the red-shanked ruffians keep off.

Pulling off his hat, and bringing his mare up in a prance
to the chair-window.

			RODERICK
	What has happened, madam, to annoy
	your ladyship?

			MRS. O'REILLY
	Oh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am
	the wife of Captain O'Reilly
	hastening to join him at Dublin.  My
	chair was stopped by a highwayman;
	this great oaf of a servant-man fell
	down on his knees, armed as he was,
	and though there were thirty people
	in the next field, working, when the
	ruffian attacked, not one of them
	would help but, on the contrary,
	wished him "good luck."

			COUNTRY FELLOW #1
	Sure, he's the friend of the poor,
	and good luck to him.

			COUNTRY FELLOW #2
	Was it any business of ours?

			RODERICK
		   (shouting)
	Be off to your work, you pack of
	rascals, or you will have a good
	taste of my thong.
		   (to Mrs. O'Reilly)
	Have you lost much?

			MRS. O'REILLY
	Everything -- my purse, containing
	upwards of a hundred guineas, my
	jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches.
	And all because this blundering
	coward fell to his knees...

			FOOTMAN
	Be fair, ma'am, them wasn't so much.
	Didn't he return you the thirteen
	pence in copper, and the watch,
	saying it was only pinchbeck?

	Don't be insolent, or I'll report
	you to the Captain.

	once made their amorous sovereign
	happy.

Roderick and the Chevalier kissing hands, hobnobbing with
the nobility, and dancing minuets.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	There was not a party of the
	nobility to which the two Irish
	gentlemen were not invited, and
	admired, nor where we did not make
	the brave, the high-born and the

Roderick and the Chevalier in a comfortable coach, on

yawns.

	which I took to the business, as

Roderick in a tub, being washed by a servant.

	For though it seems all pleasure,
	yet I assure any low-bred persons
	who may chance to read this, that
	we, their betters, have to work as
	well as they; though I did not rise
	until noon, yet had I not been up at

INT.  ANOTHER BEDROOM - GERMANY - DAY

His hair being done.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I came into it at once, and as if I

the sleeping Patrick.

			MOTHER
	Ah, Roderick, it's a blessing to see
	that my darling boy has attained a
	position I always knew was his due,
	and for which I pinched myself to
	educate him.  Little Patrick is a
	darling boy, and you live in great
	splendor, but how long will it last?
	Your lady-wife knows she has a
	treasure she couldn't have had, had
	she taken a duke to marry her, but
	if, one day, she should tire of my
	wild Roderick and his old-fashioned
	Irish ways, or if she should die,
	what future would there be for my
	son and grandson?

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - CASTLE HACKTON - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother.

			MOTHER
	You have not a penny of your own,
	and cannot transact any business
	without the Countess' signature.
	Upon her death, the entire estate
	would go to young Brookside, who
	bears you little affection.  You
	could be penniless tomorrow, and
	darling Patrick at the mercy of his
	stepbrother.

Roderick and his mother.

			MOTHER
	I shall tell you a secret -- I shall
	not rest until I see you Earl of

	received his visit.

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick and the money-broker, Mr. Newcombe.

			NEWCOMBE
	I have good news for you, Mr.
	Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle
	and Chatwick, in the city of London,
	are prepared to lend you 20,000
	pounds, pledged against your
	interest in the Edric mines.  They
	will redeem the encumbrances against
	the property, which amount to some
	10,000 pounds, and take a twenty-
	year working lease on the mines.
	They will lend you the 20,000 pounds
	against the lease income,
	which they will apply to the loan as
	it comes in, and they will make a
	charge of 18% per annum interest on
	the outstanding loan balance.

			RODERICK
	Mr. Newcombe, I have made some
	difficult loans during the past few
	years, at very onerous terms, but
	18% a year interest seems very stiff
	indeed.

			NEWCOMBE
	Considering your financial
	circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has
	been impossible to find anyone at
	all prepared to do any business with
	you.  I think you may count yourself
	lucky to have this opportunity.
	But, obviously, if you would reject
	this offer, I shall keep trying to
	find a better one.

			RODERICK
		   (after a pause)
	I am prepared to accept the terms,
	Mr. Newcombe.

			NEWCOMBE
	There are a few other points we
	should discuss.  The loan agreement
	can only be executed by her
	ladyship's signature, and provided
	that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be
	assured of her ladyship's freewill
	in giving her signature.

			RODERICK
	Provided that they can be assured of
	her ladyship's freewill?  Are you
	serious?

	May I be quite frank with you?

The three VILLAGERS who just came out of the hole, yell from the 
distance, to others still in the tunnel, pleading with them to 
come out.

Barnes throws the phosphorus in.  A muted EXPLOSION.  Then 
sizzling acidic fumes.  Frying sounds.  A hideous scream from

                   booming over the
                   lousy sound system)
            On behalf of the prosecuting
            attorneys of this county, I welcome
            you to the Third National DA's
            Conference on Narcotics and
            Dangerous Drugs.

The EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR -- well groomed, GOP businessman
type -- speaks from the podium.  A banner behind him reads:
NATIONAL DA'S CONVENTION 1971. "If You Don't Know, Come To
Learn... If You Know, Come To Teach."

A BIG MIXED CROWD: TOP LEVEL STRAIGHT COPS, UNDERCOVER NARCS
AND OTHER TWILIGHT TYPES -- beards, mustaches and super-Mod
dress.  Just because you're a cop, doesn't mean you can't be
WITH IT!  However, for every URBAN-HIPSTER there are around
20 REDNECKS.

A dozen big, low-fidelity speakers mounted on steel poles
distort and feed back the EXECUTIVE's voice through the room.

At the back, under a loudspeaker, sits DUKE -- $40 FBI
wingtips, a Pat Boone madras sportcoat, and an official name
tag: RAOUL DUKE, PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR, L.A.

GONZO sits beside him.  His name tag: DR. GONZO.  EXPERT,
CRIMINAL DRUG ANALYSIS.  He's nervous -- close to the edge.

                         GONZO
                   (lowers his voice)
            I saw these bastards in Easy Rider,
            but I didn't believe they were real.
            Not like this.  Not hundreds of them!

Rayburn flinches at some bitter memory.

            None of your business. Or mine for that
            matter. I got nothing more to say.

                         MANZANO
            This is my jurisdiction. I want these

            Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to

            his soul is true to it. Creasy's art is

EXT.   MANZANO'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Framed commendations fall to the carpet as Rosanna slams
up against the wall of Manzano's office. Skirt up around
her waist, Manzano moves inside of her. Between breaths:

                          MANZANO
             Is it true? Creasy saved the little girl
             that was kidnapped yesterday.

                          ROSANNA
             And left three more dead men.

               She puts the coffee down on the table.

               Charming piece of business as Suzette, in putting the coffee 
               down on the table must necessarily push back the heavily 
               crested cigarette case of the Baron.

               EXT. HOTEL - SIGN

               Music effect over sign "Grand Hotel." Precisely the same 
               angle as before. The sign lights.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               LOBBY - BY SENF'S DESK

               The music comes up on the DISSOLVE into the original key 
               shot of the lobby.

               Senf is busy.

               The Baron's chauffeur is standing impatiently by his desk. 
               Business ad lib of Senf. He turns to the chauffeur who is 
               barring the way of an important looking alien.

                                     SENF
                         Step back please.

               Chauffeur makes no effort to move. Against the normal busy, 
               happy traffic of the evening he is a sinister figure. He 
               does not move but glares at Senf.

                                     SENF
                         I've told you three times -- Baron 
                         von Gaigern is out.

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         Did he leave any message for me?

                                     SENF
                         No, he did not -- there is no message.

               This whole scene is played in a very low key, almost in a 
               whisper, it is interrupted by the entrance of the Doctor.

                              STEPAN
                  You have an uncle who doesn't steal
                  things from the dead. Not even
                  their secrets.

                              HELEN
                  Oh, don't go all momentous on us,
                  Stepan.
                      (she straightens
                       the table cloth)
                  Lift your elbows.

                              STEPAN
                  You should put this in her coffin,
                  Anna. Bury her secrets with her
                  bodies.

                               ANNA
                  Body.   Singular.

     Stepan leaves in a huff. Anna picks up the diary and begins
     to study it. She sees the `Trans-Siberian' business card
     between the pages.

                              ANNA (CONT'D)
                  How long will dinner be?

     Helen looks at Anna, suspecting an attempt to escape.

12   EXT. LONDON STREETS - DAY                                       12

     Driving music as we see Anna riding her motorbike through
     deserted morning streets again. We should begin to sense
     that this is a kind of release for her. We hear Tatiana
     in V.O.

                              TATIANA (V.O.)
                  When I was little, London was like
                  a place in the Bible. I wasn't
                  even sure if it was real. My friend
                  has told me there is a place in
                  London where they pay girls to
                  sing.

                  Well, you got more than a driver.

     Nikolai reaches into his pocket for a business card and
     offers it to Semyon. As Semyon looks at the card in the
     candle light, he also sees the TATTOO OF AN EAGLE on
     Nikolai's hand.

     It is obvious that the tattoo means more than the card to
     Semyon, and he reacts.

                    (in Russian)
                I think you and I could do business
                together.

     A pause.   Semyon looks at Nikolai with utter contempt.

                            SEMYON
                I have no idea what business you're
                talking about. Now get out.

     Nikolai smiles and then leaves. Semyon watches him go
     then peers at his drunken, sleeping son with something
     approaching compassion.

38   EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                          38

     Nikolai hurries   out to his car in the rain. He hears an
     engine splutter   and spots Anna still trying to kick-start
     her motorbike.    He approaches. She's already soaked.
     Nikolai watches   her try to start the bike and fail.

                            NIKOLAI
                You've got water in it.

     Deadpan, Anna looks up and holds out her hand into pouring
     rain.

                Water?    What makes you think that?

     Anna tries to start the bike again.    Nothing.

                  Sometimes I think this is all a
                  hallucination...

     He sees Semyon approaching from the kitchen and closes the
     diary. Semyon grabs a bottle of vodka from the bar on his
     way to sit opposite Nikolai. Nikolai pushes the diary
     across the table. Semyon pours two drinks.

                              SEMYON
                  It is good to have someone who I
                  can trust to do simple tasks.

     A pause as Semyon glances at a few pages of diary.

                              SEMYON (CONT'D)
                  In this business, sometimes the
                  biggest danger comes from the most
                  stupid things. You can't afford
                  to be careless in any area.

     Nikolai senses a change of attitude towards him. As if
     Semyon were beginning to accept him into the fold. Semyon
     raises a toast.

     Nikolai looks anxious.

                              NIKOLAI
                      (in Russian)

     Nikolai doesn't respond. It is obvious that Semyon half
     knows already. He shrugs...

                You play   with the Prince to do
                business   with the King. But if
                you want   to do business with me
                you must   be open with me. Thieves-
                in-law.

                            SEMYON (CONT'D)
                What was Soyka saying about the
                Prince?

     He stares into Nikolai's eyes.    Finally, Nikolai stammers...

                            NIKOLAI
                That he is a drunk.    And that he
                is also... a queer.

     Semyon swigs his vodka and Nikolai swigs his. Semyon pours
     two more. Semyon has to stare out of the window to hide
     his emotion.

                             SEMYON
                    (softly, in Russian)
                My only son.

     They both knock their drinks back. Semyon looks suddenly
     angry as he peers out of the window.

                            SEMYON (CONT'D)
                You know it never snows in this
                City. And it's never hot. London
                is a city of whores and queers.
                My son...

     Semyon shrugs, fighting deeper emotion...

                  Papa, what business? His business

                  Go to the cellar Kirill.   And take
                  your time.

     Kirill hesitates. He is angry as hell but too scared of
     his father's gaze to say anything. Finally he turns fast
     and departs, slamming his open hand against the door as he
     goes.

     Semyon waits a moment before returning to the business of

                              KIRILL
                  What business?

     A pause as Kirill suddenly senses his exclusion.

                              KIRILL (CONT'D)
                  Papa, what business? His business
                  is my business.

     Semyon stares at Kirill and Kirill knows the look.

                  Go to the cellar Kirill.   And take
                  your time.

     Kirill hesitates. He is angry as hell but too scared of
     his father's gaze to say anything. Finally he turns fast
     and departs, slamming his open hand against the door as he
     goes.

     Semyon waits a moment before returning to the business of
     cutting the cake. Finally...

     Nikolai nods.

     A pause.     Semyon looks up and fixes Nikolai with a stare.

                  and bring up some brandy. Twelve
                  bottles.

     We are in St. Pancras, North London.

     More rain. Ozim is waiting nervously, blowing into his
     hands against the cold. The Turkish bath building is a
     Victorian red-brick edifice.

     Nikolai pulls up in his Mercedes.

72   INT. TURKISH BATHS. CHANGING ROOM - DAY                         72

     Ozim and Nikolai are undressing. The place is deserted
     apart from an OLD TURKISH BATH-HOUSE ATTENDANT who is
     distributing towels. Ozim is unbuttoning his shirt.

                              OZIM
                  Semyon recommends these places for
                  business meetings because you can
                  see what tattoos a man has.

     Nikolai is pulling off his shirt and Ozim reacts to the
     sight of the fresh eight-pointed star tattoos. Ozim
     chuckles.

                              OZIM (CONT'D)
                  Come on. We have a lot to get
                  through. Let's cook.

     Ozim disappears into a steam room, naked. Nikolai watches
     him go, a private agenda bubbling beneath the surface.

      Nikolai steps forward slowly.    As he gets closer Kirill
      hugs the baby.

      Finally Nikolai reaches Kirill and hugs him. As he does
      he edges him away from the dockside. The three of them are
      locked in a long embrace.

      Nikolai emerges from the embrace with Christine in his
      arms. He quickly hands her to Anna who hugs her close.
      Kirill turns to Nikolai.

      Nikolai looks at Anna, who is hugging the baby. He waits
      a long time before realizing he must leave her.

              is packed.  He is looking for Avery.  Beat reporter Patricia
              Logan reappears.  She relishes asking brutal questions,
              innocently.

Finally forcing its way through on-coming traffic and
speeding down the alley after Fait. The ESCALADE reaches the
intersection. Turns. And... CRASHES into a DUMPSTER rolled
into its path. The dumpster forces the Escalade into a
wall.

EXT. ALLEY (SEMI-INDUSTRIAL AREA) - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Two men start to get out of the Escalade. We recognize
them: Ling's two thugs. We barely have time to realize
that Fait's escape has been blocked by construction
equipment down the alley. He's had no choice but to turn
and fight.

Which is what he does, rushing the passenger.
The battle's ferocious and fast. Ultimately, Fait's out-
muscled and out-gunned. He's forced back against the open
door of the Escalade, guns to his head.

          Here's your offer.
He cocks his pistol.   Beat.

          That shit ain't gonna do it, biggie.
          'Cause I ain't scared of guns, and I
          ain't got the stones.

You're my friend, aren't you?

RICH MAN
Yes.

Okay, no monkey business then.

He locks the door of the closet once they are inside, starts off,

and wipes his fingerprints off the door handle.

Groceries.

With this reminder he collects his bag of groceries and heads 
down the hall. 

EXT. FRONT PORCH 

Kit and Holly come out the front door. Holly wears a shawl over 
her head as a disguise, Kit wears the outfit he took off the Rich 
Man's coat rack. He carries his groceries, rifle and a silver 
trophy he stole from somewhere in the house.

Hey, why're you always walking ahead of me?

				DON CORLEONE
		Thank you, Luca, my most valued
		friend.

	THE DON takes it, and then LUCA's hand, which he squeezes so
	tightly we might imagine it to be painful.

				LUCA
		Let me leave you, Don Corleone.  I
		know you are busy.

	He turns, almost an about-face, and leaves the study with
	the same formality he entered with.  DON CORLEONE breathes
	more easily, and gives the thick envelope to HAGEN.

				DON CORLEONE
		I'm sure it's the most generous
		gift today.

				HAGEN
		The Senator called--apologized for
		not coming personally, but said
		you'd understand.  Also, some of
		the Judges...they've all sent gifts.
		And another call from Virgil
		Sollozzo.

	DON CORLEONE is not pleased.

				HAGEN
		The action is narcotics.  Sollozzo
		has contacts in Turkey for the
		poppy, in Sicily for the plants to
		process down to morphine or up to
		heroin.  Also he has access to this
		country.  He's coming to us for
		financial help, and some sort of
		immunity from the law.  For that we
		get a piece of the action, I
		couldn't find out how much.
		Sollozzo is vouched for by the
		Tattaglia family, and they may have
		a piece of the action.  They call
		Sollozzo the Turk.
		He's spent a lot of time in Turkey
		and is suppose to have a Turkish
		wife and kids.  He's suppose to be
		very quick with the knife, or was,
		when he was younger.  Only in
		matters of business and with some
		reasonable complaint.  Also he has
		an American wife and three children
		and he is a good family man.

	THE DON nods.

				HAGEN
		He's his own boss, and very
		competent.

				DON CORLEONE
		And with prison record.

				HAGEN
		Two terms; one in Italy, one in the
		United States.  He's known to the
		Government as a top narcotics man.
		That could be a plus for us; he
		could never get immunity to testify.

				DON CORLEONE
		When did he call?

Title: Godfather
Genres:

				DON CORLEONE
		I'll make him an offer he can't
		refuse.

	He takes JOHNNY to the door, pinching his cheek hard enough
	to hurt.

				DON CORLEONE
		Now go back to the party and leave
		it to me.

	He closes the door, smiling to himself.  Turns to HAGEN.

				DON CORLEONE
		When does my daughter leave with
		her bridegroom?

				HAGEN
		They'll cut the cake in a few
		minutes...leave right after that.
		Your new son-in-law, do we give him
		something important?

				DON CORLEONE
		No, give him a living.  But never
		let him know the family's business.
		What else, Tom?

				HAGEN
		I've called the hospital; they've
		notified Consiglere Genco's family
		to come and wait.  He won't last
		out the night.

	This saddens the DON.  He sighs.

				DON CORLEONE
		Genco will wait for me.  Santino,
		tell your brothers they will come
		with me to the hospital to see
		Genco.  Tell Fredo to drive the big
		car, and ask Johnny to come with us.

				SONNY
		And Michael?

				DON CORLEONE
		All my sons.
			  (to HAGEN)
		Tom, I want you to go to California
		tonight.  Make the arrangements.
		But don't leave until I come back
		from the hospital and speak to you.
		Understood?

				SOLLOZZO
		My compliments.  I'll take care of
		them from my share.

				DON CORLEONE
		So.  I receive 30 per cent just for
		finance and legal protection.  No
		worries about operations, is that
		what you tell me?

				SOLLOZZO
		If you think two million dollars in
		cash is just finance, I congratulate
		you Don Corleone.

	There is a long silence; in which each person present feels
	the tension.  The DON is about to give his answer.

				DON CORLEONE
		I said I would see you because I've
		heard you're a serious man, to be
		treated with respect...
			  (pause)
		But I'll say no to you.

	We feel this around the room.

				DON CORLEONE
		I'll give you my reasons.  I have
		many, many friends in Politics.
		But they wouldn't be so friendly if
		my business was narcotics instead
		of gambling.  They think gambling
		is something like liquor, a harmless
		vice...and they think narcotics is
		dirty business.

	SOLLOZZO takes a breath.

				DON CORLEONE
		No...how a man makes his living is
		none of my business.  But this
		proposition of yours is too risky.
		All the people in my family lived
		well the last ten years, I won't
		risk that out of greed.

				SOLLOZZO
		Are you worried about security for
		your million?

				DON CORLEONE
		No.

				SOLLOZZO
		The Tattaglias will guarantee your
		investment also.

	This startles SONNY; he blurts out.

	INT NITE: NIGHTCLUB (WINTER 1945)

	The main floor of the Nightclub is very large, with endless
	glistening wooden floors.  Now, at this late time, the
	chairs have been stacked on the tables and a NEGRO JANITOR
	is waxing them.  A single HAT-CHECK GIRL is counting her
	receipts.  LUCA moves past the empty bandstand, and sits at
	the bar.  ANOTHER MAN, dark and very well-built, moves
	behind the bar.

				MAN
		Luca...I'm Bruno Tattaglia.

				LUCA
		I know.

	LUCA looks up; and out of the shadows emerges SOLLOZZO.

				SOLLOZZO
		Do you know who I am?

	LUCA Nods.

				SOLLOZZO
		You've been talking to the
		Tattaglias.  They thought we could
		do business.

	LUCA listens.

				SOLLOZZO
		I need somebody strong to protect
		my operation, physically.  I've
		heard you're not happy with your
		family, you might make a switch.

				LUCA
		If the money is good enough.

				SOLLOZZO
		On the first shipment, I can
		guarantee you fifty thousand dollars.

	LUCA looks at him; he had no idea the offer would be so good.

	SOLLOZZO extends his hand, but LUCA pretends not to see it,
	rather, he busies himself putting a cigarette in his mouth.
	BRUNO TATTAGLIA, behind the bar, makes a cigarette lighter
	magically appear, and holds it to LUCA's cigarette.  Then,
	he does an odd thing; he drops the lighter on the bar, and
	puts his hand lightly on LUCA's, almost patting it.

			  (pushing the bottle)
		Have some more.  We got him outside
		his office, just before I picked
		you up.  You have to make the peace
		between me and Santino.

	HAGEN still is focused on the grief of losing the old man.

				SOLLOZZO
		Sonny was hot for my deal, right?
		You know it's the smart thing to
		do, too.  I want you to talk Sonny
		into it.

				HAGEN
			  (pulling himself together)
		Sonny will come after you with
		everything he's got.

	SOLLOZZO rises, impatiently.

				SOLLOZZO
		That's going to be his first
		reaction.  You have to talk some
		sense into him.  The Tattaglia
		family stands behind me with all
		their people.  The other New York
		Families will go along with anything
		that prevents a full scale war.

	He leans close to HAGEN.

		The Don was slipping; in the old
		days I could never have gotten to
		him.  Now he's dead, nothing can
		bring him back.  Talk to Sonny,

		and Tessio...it's good business.

		Even Sonny won't be able to call
		off Luca Brasi.

		I'll worry about Luca.  You take
		care of Sonny and the other two kids.

	it difficult to see well.  The wipers move across the view,
	as the gate of the Corleone Mall appears before us, still
	decorated for Christmas.  The courtyard is bathed with white
	floodlight, giving this place a cold and isolated look.  The
	narrow entrance mouth of the Mall is sealed off with a link
	chain.  There are strange cars parked along the curving
	cement walk.  SEVERAL MEN are congregated about the gate and
	chain; ONE of them approaches MICHAEL's car.

	HAGEN widens his sleepy eyes, and looks at the yellow pad.

		Too much, too far, too personal.

	stationed more formally; and some of them visibly carrying
	rifles; those of the houses close to the courtyard have MEN
	standing by open windows.  It is clear that the war is
	escalating.  A car pulls up and out get CLEMENZA, LAMPONE,

	stops and looks up at the open window.  We can see MEN
	holding rifles.

CUT TO

PATTERSON'S TENT AREA. One or two Africans. Samuel darts into his 
tent, emerges with something, holds it out to Patterson.

IT'S A NECKLACE OF LION CLAWS.

Patterson makes an almost courtly bow of thanks, puts it on- he 
never takes it off again. He walks on alone now until at last-

CUT TO

THE BRIDGE.

It stops abruptly, halfway done; the foundations are in place, a 
lot of the scaffolding, but it's useless. Late afternoon. 
Desolate.

Redbeard sits alone, high on one of the foundations. He looks as 
he did the night before.

Patterson walks to the top of the near embankment. He is unshaven, 
wrinkled, he fingers the lion claw necklace.

For a moment, neither says a word. Then-

				REDBEARD
			(out of the blue)
		It would have been a beautiful 
		bridge, John. I never noticed 
		before, occupied with other 
		business, I	suppose...

		...never really pay much attention

A LONG SHOT OF A HIGH ROCKY CLIFF-

-we haven't seen anything like it before- it's hundreds of feet 
tall- gorgeous early morning light.

As we watch, we realize there are two dots on the side of the 
cliff.

As we watch a moment more, we realize the dots are moving.

CAMERA MOVES CLOSER.

THE DOTS are Patterson and Redbeard, working their way along the 
rock face. Patterson is much more nimble. It's dangerous, of 
course, but neither of them seems to have that uppermost in mind. 
They travel lightly- small knapsacks and their weapons.

                         What am I going to do?

               And now he begins to dissassemble, openly crying--on the 
               verge of a complete breakdown. Matt moves into frame, grabbing 
               Burke, trying to provide him with an anchor.

               CLOSE ON MATT

               His face--his eyes providing a beacon of strength.

                                     MATT
                         Hey. Hey! HEY!!

               ON BURKE

               Totally fucked-up, wild-eyed. As he witnesses his own state.

                         Look at me. You'd think I was a

                              (his story of travail 
                              pours from him)
                         I hired this kid as a production 
                         assistant. His father's a business 
                         manager... a few good clients.

                                     MATT
                         What happened?

                                     BURKE
                         He's been driving for me two weeks... 
                         all he has to do is pick me up on 
                         time... he's twenty minutes late and 
                         I have a test screening in the valley. 
                         Everybody's gone from the office.

               Burke flails at himself as Matt looks at him.

                                     MATT
                         Is that it? You need a lift?

                                     MATT
                         I've been an actor most of my life 
                         and this is the first time I've ever 
                         heard what the people calling the 
                         shots sound like when they're casting. 
                         So I really want to find out what,

                         Oh, you couldn't be more wrong. And 
                         I'm not talking to you. And I don't

               Matt is very close to him--he shakes his chair.

                         You're minding my business. That's 
                         the problem... so, just tell me,

                         Just tell me and I'll shut up.

          Khaled hears his name being called from below. A few feet
          away from him in the dimly lit hall is a loaded AK-47. He
          goes to the gun and picks it up.
          He hears his name again, "Khaled!" And the voice sounds
          friendly, urgent.
          Perhaps thinking that he can surrender peacefully, Khaled
          puts the gun down, resting it against a wall, and turns and
          heads back to the sound of his name.
          Saber sees Khaled poke his head around the corner of the
          stairway and fires - killing him instantly.
          Saber pushes past the body, Patrick following, and they climb

                         other.

                         other, will we?

               No, actually, no, I'd like it very much
               if you would ask her to come back later.

                         RIPLEY
               I think I just said. Ripley was handling
               some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley
               want to marry me.  Nor did he ask me
               every day if I would marry him. And when.

                         ROVERINI
               Do you have a photograph of Signor
               Ripley?

                         RIPLEY
               I'm not in the habit of carrying around
               photographs of my male friends.

                         ROVERINI
               Now I think I have upset you. My English
               perhaps is coarse.

                         RIPLEY
               It is a little coarse, yes.

      Blood red walls.

      Dark, neglected and to all appearances empty.       Bloom creeps
      down the darkened corridor, gun outstretched.       Breathes

                  I'm sorta between jobs.  Look,

        A hand on Bud's shoulder.  He turns to see Dudley Smith.

                  Lad, may I have a word with you?

                  Say goodnight to your friend and
                  join me by those back tables.

        Dudley starts off.  Bud turns back to Redhead, but she's
        already talking to a sailor.


        BOOTH

        Dudley sits at a table.  A newspaper is opened, a little
        mound underneath.  Bud joins Dudley.

                                BUD
                  Does that paper say we've been
                  indicted?  Does it say Exley's a

        INT. BEVERLY HILLS MANSION - STUDY - NIGHT

        Deuce Perkins (the Mickey Cohen narcotics lieutenant seen
        earlier) stands at the bookshelf.  He pulls down books to
        reveal a shoe box.  He sets it on his desk, pulls back
        the cover to reveal several bags of white powder.
        Heroin.

        A BRANCH SNAPS outside.  Perkins opens a drawer, fishes a
        revolver.  Turning off the light, he heads to the window.
        His finger parts the curtains.  At that instant, he
        staggers, falls as GUNFIRE rips into him.

          Do you know what you can do with
          that money, Vince?

          Don't worry. The balloon payment's
          due on the first. She doesn't have

          IN TESS'S OFFICE, Tess stands in the doorway, having heard.
          Then she walks back to her desk and sits, dejected. Head in
          her hands. For the first time ever, looking worried and
          defeated. Something she'd never show anyone. A beat. Then:

          Ever since I started hanging out

          LIKE A UNIFORMED HOTEL WORKER. SHEPARD is still dressed like
          a G-man from the 50's.

                         I don't think I know that one.  
                         Private, I suppose.

               INT. CASINO - HALL - DAY

               The full overhead lights give the casino an exposed, tacky 
               appearance, devoid of mystery or glamour. The place has 
               roulette tables and blackjack counters. It is deserted 
               except for several CLEANING LADIES, vacuuming, emptying 
               ashtrays. REYNOLDS walks with JACK, talking.

                         There are three types of casino in 
                         the U.K. High volume. Small faction. 
                         And MOTR. That's middle of the 
                         road. Us.

                                     JACK
                         Do you have a Salon Prive?

                         We tried. But there wasn't enough 
                         business. The punters like company.

               REYNOLDS goes to one of the tables with JACK.

                                     REYNOLDS
                         Let's see you handle the chips.

               He slides open a box and tips 200 chips of varying 
               denominations onto the table.

                                     JACK
                         I have to assume the serial numbers

                         He suddenly wanted to be rid of 
                         it. 'Hang on tightly, let go 
                         lightly'. It was a saying Jack 
                         remembered.

               JACK leans into the open car and takes out his hat and 
               cigarettes. He has accepted the offer. The music begins...

               box, gift-wrapped. JACK opens it. Inside the tissue paper

               book charm around his neck. She moves from the middle to 
               one side of the bed, making room for him. He holds the 
               charm.

                  Ah, sweetie. Your daddy's done this
                  before. Just takes off, no call,
                  nothing. I told your mother, "You
                  pack that son-of-a-bitch's bags and
                  have `em waiting for him on the front

          The breastbone of a frigate bird. Do you

friends keen interest in this strange assembly

          I do and I am not in the least surprised,
          for it reminds me of nothing so much as a
          ship under sail. See here the bowsprit.
          Here the mast, and here the backstays
          running aft.

          Ten pounds sixteen ounces. I am preparing

specimens, open books and brass measuring instruments

          Recife for provisions. You may care to
          take a tour round the forests of Brazil,
          botanizing and collecting specimens. An
          anaconda or two. A giant cassowary.

DAVIES and KILLICK scowl across the deck at HOLLOM, who looks
wretched but says nothing.

		Yes, sir. Absolutely. I've learned

	activity, worn cap on his head, exchanging hellos and doing 
	minor business. He's an important man here. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		There's a con like me in every prison 
		in America, I guess. I'm the guy who 
		can get it for you. Cigarettes, a 
		bag of reefer if you're partial, a 
		bottle of brandy to celebrate your

		near anything, within reason.

		Yes sir, I'm a regular Sears &amp;

	TWO SHORT SIREN BLASTS issue from the main tower, drawing

		Fair enough. A rock-hammer is about 
		eight or nine inches long. Looks 
		like a miniature pickaxe, with a 
		small sharp pick on one end, and a

		for rocks.

          TWO-SEATERS, armed with TWIN MACHINE-GUNS for the PILOT, and a
          flexible MACHINE-GUN for the OBSERVER.
          
          CLOSE ON: PILOT'S FINGER on trigger.
          
          A COLD WIND blows ANN'S hair as she watches the PLANES approach.
          KONG is UNEASY about these BUZZING PREDATORS as they CIRCLE above
          him.
          
          The NAVAL PLANES peel off into an ATTACKING DIVE at KONG.
          
          DOWN GUN-SIGHTS ... drifting left and right as KONG grows in size

		That's ridiculous.

				MONICA
		What's ridiculous is not being a caterer
		so your husband can feel like a man
		knowing his woman's home cooking and
		ironing his drawers.

	WHAP!  Camille's humiliation is immediate and she cuts off
	Monica with a SLAP.  Camille curses herself for losing it.

				CAMILLE
		Dammitt, Monica!

	Monica is stunned, hurt.

				MONICA
		I'm sorry.

	Camille stares at her daughter, devastated.

				CAMILLE
		Is that really all you think of me?

	Monica can't answer.

				CAMILLE (cont'd)
		When I married your father, all I wanted
		was a nice house with a big kitchen so I
		could start my catering business.  And
		then I got pregnant with Lena, and then I
		got pregnant with you.  And I put it out
		of my mind because that's what you did.

	Monica stares at her mother.

				CAMILLE (cont'd)
		But you want to know what day I remember?
		In high school, you getting ready for the
		Spring Dance.  I put my pearls around
		your neck, told you you were beautiful
		and you looked like you were going to
		cry.  That day I was happy I didn't have
		a catering business to run off to.  My
		family had three meals a day, had someone
		to pick up after them, and when my
		daughters went to a dance, I helped them
		get ready.  That's what I came to care
		about.

				MONICA
			(softly)
		That's all you cared about.  I must have
		played in a thousand games and I can only
		remember you being to two.

				CAMILLE
		You had your coaches and your father for
		that stuff.  It never mattered one way or
		the other if I went to your games.

				MONICA
		It mattered, Mom.

	Camille looks at her daughter and is struck by the need in

               As he calls in, Willy sees Nikki through the doors - one of
               a half-dozen ASSOCIATES trailing in the wake of BOB WOOTON.
               They all carry expensive business luggage, except Wooton -
               who is powerful, perfectly groomed, and two decades older.

               Wooton glances back at Nikki, eyes saying: don't take long.
               She nods as Wooton and the team continue to the elevators -
               staying back by the glass doors to talk with Willy:

             ... how he gives freely of his time
             and money, but let's get Earl up

congratulations along the way, arrives at the podium.

EXT. INDUSTRIAL SECTION OF CHICAGO � DAY

A Cab arrives at the Front Entrance of the BROOKS BOX
FACTORY, a long three story brick Building.

A YOUNG WOMAN, 19, is dropped off along with an assortment of
luggage and boxes.

INT. BROOKS BOX FACTORY � DAY

It's loud. We follow a thin piece of cardboard as one machine
deals it off the bottom of a stack into the maw of another
machine.

That machine prints one side of the cardboard blue.

It is handed off to the third machine which cuts the flaps.
The fourth machine folds and glues those flaps and spits the
piece of cardboard out onto a conveyor belt as a box.

Wearing safety glasses and ear protectors along with his
business suit, Mr. Brooks picks up the box and hands it to
one of three similarly attired MEN, standing nearby.

                    MR. BROOKS
          Ahhhh... now I remember. Her
          father, Gerald Atwood, never did
          business with him but Emma and I
          met him a couple times, big
          political fundraiser. He owns or
          owned one of the largest insurance
          groups in the country and a lot of
          other stuff.

Tap, tap, tap. Jesse Vialo's Driver's license comes up.

          The old man being rich doesn't mean
          she's rich. Maybe he's one of those
          guys who would rather give it to
          the Opera than to his kids.

          You're such a fucking snob, Earl.
          You like her because she's rich.

                    MR. BROOKS
          No, I like her because she found
          something that's hers. It's not the
          family business. And she's good at
          it. I'd like Jane to find something
          that's hers and that she could be
          good at.

          That's exactly why Atwood scares
          the shit out of me. She's a cop who
          doesn't need the money and she's
          looking for us. That's one fucking
          dangerous human being.

          You might be right, Earl, you might
          be. Because you know if she's not
          stopped, she's going to do it
          again. And if she wants to take
          over the box business, the next
          victim could be you.

INT. DETECTIVE ATWOOD'S CONDOMINIUM - MORNING

Reflected in the glass of an open mirrored closet door is a
tastefully furnished DEN with floor-to-ceiling windows that
look out at LAKE MICHIGAN from the 20th floor.

An empty suitcase falls into this picture and bounces on the
carpet. Behind the mirrored door, Detective Atwood is atop a
stepstool rummaging through the suitcases on the highest
shelf.

Throughout the Condo there is an incessant ringing of the
phones.

Another suitcase goes down and Atwood finds what she's
looking for - a framed color 8 x 10 photo of her husband,
Jesse. He's in a business suit and holding some kind of
trophy.

The phones stop ringing.

Atwood comes down the stepstool, folds it and is carrying it
back to where it lives when the phones start ringing again.

She picks up a cordless in the Den.

          "with it," you're really pathetic.
          We're trying to have an intelligent
          conversation...

          ARCHIE
          About what?

          PETULIA
          Well, about Polo, among other things.

          ARCHIE
          Polo is none of your damned business.

          PETULIA
          That's dumb. Dumb. She's my business
          and she's this lady's business. I
          happen to hate Polo.

          ARCHIE
          (to May)
          Needless to say she's never even met Polo.

          PETULIA
          I look at you and I know Polo.
          (to Map)
          Explain that to him.
          May looks at Archie in bewilderment, she is not quite sure
          how to react; but when she makes up her mind it will be
          the exactly right reaction. Also, in all truth, Petulia
          is frightened by May.

          PETULIA
          How many years were you married., Archie?
          Eight? Ten? Anyhow, the best, Wasted.
          Gone down the drain.

          ARCHIE
          Oh, come on ..o

          won't have you cross-examining this

          Your son nearly killed this girl.

          Hey now listen, doe, I'll stand still
          for only so much.

          MR. DANNER
          (to the nurse)
          I want you to remember what this man
          just said.
          (to Archie)
          Though it's none of your business, my
          boy was in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
          Looking at boats.

          PETULIA
          We've decided we're quite happy with
          the one we have.

          DAVID
          When Dad phoned me I was having dinner
          with a cousin of ours. Real mouth-
          watering Creole cooking.
          He and Petulia chuckle at each other as though this
          were some kind of private joke. Archie crosses to
          Petulia and just stands there looking at her. He
          doesn't know what to do.

          PETULIA

          (HAPPILY)
          I'm fine Archie. Except I burp a lot.
          Everybody gets dizzy spells.
          Archie looks incredulously from Petulia who has resumed
          brushing the nurse's hair; to David; to Mr. Danner who's
          obviously annoyed at Archie's bad taste; to Mrs. Danner
          who is in the dining room setting up an extra place
          for Archie. What can he do? Abruptly he rushes from
          the house.

Because I'm professionally
concerned about him. And he'd

      I'll tell you the events. The

      Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven-
      year-old daughter's throat. Graham
      shot him with his .38 six times.
      Hobbs still didn't go down. He had

      That's when it happened?

      No. It happened when Graham went
      to see Hobbs' daughter four months
      later in the hospital. She saved
      her carotid artery.., but lost
      three fingers and her larynx. She
      was connected up to a voice box.
      When Graham went to see her, she
      asked him -- through the speaker:
      'Why did you have to kill my
      daddy? '

  They stand in that corridor -- in that small space.  Second time
  saying goodbye.  A strange feeling of intimacy.  She leans
  forward and she kisses him.  Total silence.  A real sense of the
  strangeness of those lips, those famous lips on his.  They part.

    I apologize for the 'surreal but nice'

        BERNIE
    Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock-
    market, so not really similar fields,
    though I have done some amateur stuff
    -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce,
    all that.  'Ooh -- careful there,
    vicar.'  Always imagined it's a
    pretty tough job, though, acting.
    I mean the wages are a scandal,
    aren't they?

        ANNA
    Well, they can be.

        BERNIE
    I see friends from university --
    clever chaps -- been in the business
    longer than you -- they're scraping
    by on seven, eight thousand a year.
    It's no life.  What sort of acting
    do you do?

        ANNA
    Films mainly.

        BERNIE
    Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the
    pay in movies?  I mean, last film you
    did, what did you get paid?

    Fifteen million dollars.

    You can stay calm -- it's the perfect

    bump into will know.  'Well done you --
    you slept with that actress -- we've
    seen the pictures.'

    That's spectacularly unfair.

    It's really not my business any more.

		Yes, it's true! The plague is spreading along 
		the west coast. People are dying like flies. 
		Usually business would be good at this time of 
		year, but, damn it, I've still got my whole 
		stock unsold.

				WOMAN 
		They speak of the judgment day. And all these 
		omens are terrible. Worms, chopped-off hands 
		and other monstrosities began pouring out of 
		an old woman, and down in the village another

		The day of judgment. Imagine.

		It hasn't rained here for a month. We'll surely

		And people are acting crazy, I'd say. They flee

		wherever they go.

	Just as Drew removes color-coded folders from his attache

	pilot waves to Drew, indicating 'phone call'.  Drew gets up
	and heads for the cockpit, Parrish scans the folders, glances
	over at Susan who is making some notes on a file of her own.
	He motions to her to please come sit beside him, she checks
	that Drew is still busy in the cockpit, tucks her papers into

	work that Drew set before him into his tray table, locks it.

		Joe knew the whole story.  I told
		him.  It was his idea that I come
		clean.  I mean I wanted to come
		clean but he gave me a pair of
		balls, you know what I mean?

			     PARRISH
		Yes, I believe I do.

	Quince now drifts off.

			QUICHE
		Yeah, well -- I can tell you guys
		got business --

			     PARRISH
		No, I'm out of business, right,
		Quince?  However I do have some
		unfinished business -- with Drew.
		Get him out here.  Get him on the
		chopper and get him out here to-
		night.  I want to tell this guy
		how I feel about him face-to-face.

			     QUINCE
		Oh, that could be a tall order, B.P.
		I doubt that Drew's anxious to see
		you face-to-face.

	Joe steps in.

			     JOE
			(to Quince)
		Tell Drew that Bill acknowledges
		that this was a contest and he's
		lost.  The race is to the swift,
		but could Drew summon a modicum
		of understanding and allow Bill to
		save face.  Tell him Bill wants it
		understood in the business community
		he has merely moved upstairs in his
		own company, and the executive
		continuity is unbroken.  Tonight's
		the night to do it.  He'll introduce
		Drew to his press friends as well as
		some of his close acquaintances from
		Washington and Drew can tell them
		that everything's sailing along just
		fine.

	Parrish is impressed by Joe's acumen, a look of grudging
	admiration.  He nods to Joe, summarizes:

			(to Quince)
		All in all, what Bill wants to do is
		build the golden bridge to Drew with

           ANNOUNCER #1 (V.O.)
           Tommy told me that he's chasing the
           record of Theogenes, apparently a
           mythical Greek fighter said to be
           unbeaten in over 1400 bouts...
                         
          Paddy opens the door to find Colt Boyd standing on the stoop.
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           How you doin,' sir? I'm looking for
           Tommy Riordan.
                         
          Paddy registers the name "Riordan."
                         
                          PADDY
           Who?
                         
                          COLT BOYD
           Tommy Riordan? My name's Colt Boyd.
                         
                          PADDY
           What business you got with Tommy?
           18.

           None yet. That's why I'm here. I
           manage fighters.
                         
          Colt looks at Paddy. Jams his hands in his pockets. He's
          obviously waiting for an invite inside. It doesn't come.

           Tommy's been working out at my gym.
           He put a beating on the number one
           middleweight contender in the world
           today. I want to know more about
           the guy. Maybe help him out. I have
           a lot of contacts, Mr. Riordan.

           You're trying? Now? Where were you

           back when I was a kid. I don't need
           you now. It's too late now.
           Everything's already happened. You
           and Brendan don't seem to
           understand that. Let me explain
           something to you: the only thing I
           have in common with Brendan Conlon
           is that we have absolutely no use
           for you.
                         
          Paddy's shaken. He can't fathom the anger in Tommy, yet he
          knows he's responsible. It's written all over him. Tears well
          up in his eyes. They seem to make Tommy madder.
