                           FRANK
               She asked me to pick her up.

                           COATES
               I know, but she told me to tell you 
               she wants to crash here a few hours. 
               Terrible about her father, isn't it?

                           FRANK
               I better just go in and see her.

     Kanita sits on the sofa next to an unshaven sleeping man. 
     Coates gestures:

               I call this the Oasis. Refuge from 
               the world out there. Did you know 
               two people were shot in this building 
               last week?

     Frank heads down the hall toward the rear of the apartment; 
     Coates follows. They pass an open door where inside TIGER, a 
     fat man with dried blood running down the corner of his mouth, 
     sits punching computer keys at a desk.

                           COATES (CONT'D)
               Careful. That's the Tiger. The lady's 
               down the hall. Welcome to Sunrise 
               Enterprises, Frank, the stress-free 
               factory.

     In the NEXT ROOM Mary lies on a mattress on the floor, yellow 
     sheet pulled up to her neck. Frank leans over her:

                           FRANK
               Mary. Mary, we've got to get going.

                           MARY
                    (groggy)
               No, no.

               She wanted something to help her 
               sleep.

               ANOTHER DAY. They're dressed differently. Sofie seems more 
               vigorous.

                         I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.

                         Well... I'm tired all the time, 
                         obviously. I always feel like taking 
                         a nap. But when I try to sleep, I 
                         have trouble.
                              (Mumford nods)
                         My muscles ache. And my joints. I 
                         feel like an old person, or like I 
                         did back when I used to work out too 
                         hard... What else?...

                         Don't you find it incredibly 
                         convenient that everyone who could 
                         possibly corroborate his story has 
                         recently died some exotic death?

                         But they're certainly dead. And yes, 
                         personally, I find it a bit odd.

                                     DELBANCO
                         It could happen. What about his state 
                         certification exams? The records 
                         seem to be in order.

               Lionel's derisive snort is so obnoxious, it's hard to bear.

                         some numbers? For all you know he 
                         never even took the exams!

                         it sounds to me like you've gone for 
                         this guy's story hook, line and bull-

                         him than I understand, Ernest. Did I 
                         miss something?

          Hi. It's Erica. I'm not here so
          leave a message.
He realizes he doesn't know what to say, hangs up, then looks
at her glasses.

                    HARRY

              (grabbing his chest)
          Ouch.

BLACK SCREEN




A LIGHT POPS ON and Erica ENTERS HER BEDROOM, crying. She
flops down on her bed, picks up her phone, grabs her glasses,
puts them on, doesn't realize they're Harry's. She dials.
Voice Mail tells her she has One Message. She sits up,
excited.             J

                     ULIAN'S VOICE

          Erica, Hi, it's Julian. It's about
          8:20, I'm in the restaurant...just
          Wondering if you're...
Erica hangs up, starts crying again. She takes off her
glasses to wipe her eyes when she realizes she's holding
Harry's glasses. Just the sight of them makes her burst into
tears, the kind of tears that have been thirty years in the
making.

ERICA'S COMPUTER KEYBOARD - NIGHT

A tear lands on it. Erica, back in a turtleneck and wearing
Harry's glasses, starts writing at a breakneck pace, all the
while, tears flood her eyes.

MORNING - WAVES BREAKING ON THE SHORE


ERICA

wakes up. As soon as her eyes open, she bursts into tears.
While in the SHOWER, the crying never stops. While she EATS
BREAKFAST, a downpour. Running ON THE BEACH, she's wailing.
Back at the "COMPUTER, she's sobbing as her hands fly over
the keys. An actual boo hoo can be heard.
At NIGHT, laptop in bed, Erica writes, eating a   bagel, wearing
Harry's glasses and a pair of wrinkled pajamas,   FRENCH MUSIC plays
in the BG. At this point, she doesn't eVen" pay   attention to her
tears, just wipes and types when out of nowhere   she receives an
INSTANT MESSAGE from HARRY.
He writes: Do I hear French Music?
Shocked, she sits up, tries to fix her hair.

          No one on earth would forgive you
          for that kiss
              (places his wine glass on
               the counter)
          May I?
Erica nods as Julian takes her in his arms and gives her a
kiss that doesn't quit.

                    JULIAN

              (still holding her,
              whispers)
          I forgive you.
Erica very distinctly begins to hear the BEATING of her own
heart.

                                          DISSOLVE TO:


ERICA'S COMPUTER SCREEN - ANOTHER NIGHT

On it is written: The lights on the Eiffel Tower dim to black
as the music continues to play.
Erica sits back, still wearing Harry's glasses. Finished at
last. She notices an empty Kleenex box on her desk. She
tosses it in a hook shot across the room and it lands right
in the trash can.

INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Julian sits on the sofa, shoes off, reading the first half of
the play. A fire burns in the fireplace. Erica approaches the
back of the sofa, holding the rest of the pages.

                    JULIAN

          It's the best thing you've ever written.

                    ERICA

          It is?

                    JULIAN

          It's wonderful. It's sweet. It's smart.
          It's funny.
Erica leans oyer the sofa, reading over his shoulder.

                  But what is it about?

     No takers.

                              JOHN (CONT'D)
                  It is about how rational thought
                  destroys the soul. It is about the
                  triumph of irrationality, and the
                  power that is in it.

54   INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - LIBRARY -- DAY                            54

     John drops an armload of books into a library cart, each
     having something to do with prison or prison life.

     He sits at a table at the back, flipping through them one at
     a time and discards each in turn.

     As the shadows grow longer we find him staring at the computer
     screen linked to the school system.

     ON THE SCREEN: a book summary disappears, to be replaced by
     the school search engine -- many of the items have already
     been inspected. John finds one that reads "Over The Walls."              

     He clicks on the link and the title page appears. The author
     is DAMON PENNINGTON. There's a photo of him. The caption
     reads that he LIVES IN BROOKLYN, NY.

55   EXT. BROOKLYN, NEW YORK - STREET -- DAY                            55

     John gets out of a cab and heads into a local dive bar.

     A couple of guys at the bar yell at the dog race on the TV               
     screen. DAMON hands John a beer and nods toward a table.

                   Hello.

      He remains stern-faced. Taking their passports, he examines

      at them, looks at the passports again, then finally waves
      them through.

          a COMPUTER. Robert sits with Syd in the next room.
                         
                          SYD

                          SYD
           Courts aren't for certainty, but he
           says he was at home, why shouldn't
           he be? A phone call doesn't make
           him a liar.
           (off Robert's nod)
           But what's baffling to me, though,
           despite your sentimental history
           together, is why you would put your
           family's future in this kid's hands.

 As if you took all the files on all of your computers and
 spilled them out onto your screen and they were all visible
 at once, but in a futuristic 3-D version. This gives Theodore
 a little anxiety attack.

            Let's start with your emails. You
            have several thousand emails

            Yeah, there are some funny ones.
            I'd say there are about 86 that we
            should save. We can delete the
            rest.

 INT. THEODORE'S OFFICE LUNCH ROOM - DAY

 Theodore sits at the table reading a physics book. He picks
 up his earpiece to call Samantha.

               (laughing at himself)
           Samantha, this physics book is
           really dense. I'm halfway through
           half of the first chapter. It's
           making my brain hurt.

           Hello, Samantha? Hello?

 He looks down at his device, sees a message: Operating System
 Not Found. Confused, he waits, tries again: Operating System
 Not Found. Anxious, he runs to his office computer. He gets
 the same message: Operating System Not Found. He starts
 trying to connect to Samantha on both the phone and computer,
 but no luck. He starts to panic, sits for a beat, looks
 around, then stands and hurries out of the office. In the
 elevator he frantically tries his device with no luck.

 EXT. PLAZA - DAY

 Theodore runs out of the building. He keeps trying Samantha,
 but no answer. He trips over someone selling something, slams
 hard into the ground, scrambles to pick up his device. People
 come over to ask if he's okay. He says he's fine, runs off.

 He stops in his tracks.

          Liz's gaze settles on the painted sign for the zoo.

          I thought we might have a table

          Well, it's a lesson. You never
          know what people will do. All my
          work used to be on-line, my e-
          mails on an open server. A year
          ago, someone broke into my office
          and stole my computer. I believe
          they were after my research.
          Luckily, I split my data up and
          double encrypt it until I put it
          all together and make it public.
          That's why this stays with me

                    Very interesting, Bob. Let's make a
                    note of that. Andy didn't lose the
                    complaint in his computer. He
                    never put it in. He lied about

                    should say so, when you're called
                    to the stand. After all, this
                    isn't a conspiracy.

Wheeler and the gang moves on, leaving Seidman alone in the
high-ceilinged corridor.

Belinda hesitates, before re-grouping with Wheeler and the
rest, casting a curious glance toward Bob Seidman.

          MARX is in his Operating Systems class. This is considered the
          hardest class at Harvard and MARK is one of the 50 students
          with their laptops open as the professor takes them through an
          impossibly difficult lesson,

                         PROFESSOR
          So let's look at a sample problem:
          Suppose we're given a computer with a 16-
          bit virtual address and a page size of
          256 bytes.
          A GIRL scribbles something on a piece of paper. Then hands it
          to the student next to her and nods that it should be passed
          over to MARK. While that's happening--

                         PROFESSOR (CONT'D)
          The system uses one-level page tables,
          which start at address 0x0400. Maybe you
          want to have DMA. on your 16-bit system,
          who knows? The first few pages are
          reserved for hardware flags, etc.
          MARK opens the note., It reads "Asshole".
          He looks over and sees a couple of GIRLS looking at him with
          contempt.

                         PROFESSOR (CONT'D)
          Assume page table entries have eight
          status bits.
          MARK closes his laptop, gets up and starts to head out of the
          hall.

                         PROFESSOR (CONT'D)
          The eight status bits would be--

                         (RE: MARK)
          And I see we have our first surrender.
          Don't worry, Mr. Zuckerber�, brighter, men
          than you have tried and failed at this
          class.

          to be in charge. of publicity and
          outreach. You can start by getting a
          story about the expansion in the B.U.

          They hate doing stories about Harvard.

                         MARK -
          Somebody at the newspaper will be a
          computer science major and they will have
          heard of me. Tell 'em Mark Zuckerberg
          will do 10 hours of free programming for

          Why do you want a story in the B.U.---

                         MARK
          Because I do. Here's the business
          arrangement. Eduardo's CFO and owns 30%
          of the company, Dustin's Vice President
          and Head of Programming and his 5% of the
          company will come from my end. Chris is
          Director of Publicity and his
          compensation will depend on the amount of
          work he ends up doing. Any questions?

                             VALENTINE (O.C.)
                 --Charlie, Echo, India.  Descend for landing
                 on heading zero...two...nine.

     The Pilot picks up the radio, looks to Yuri.  Yuri shakes his head,
     dialling his satellite phone.  Yuri's call is answered.

                             YURI
                      (into phone, trying not to sound
                       too desperate)
                 Colonel Southern, it's Yuri.  Sorry to call
                 you on this number but I've got an Interpol
                 jet and--

     The jet outside the window falls back.

     INT.  A PENTAGON OFFICE.  DAY.

     A mid-rank office dominated by a computer terminal.  We look over
     COLONEL SOUTHERN's shoulder.  He is admiring a new medal.  Two other MEN
     IN SUITS sit opposite.

                             COL. SOUTHERN
                      (into phone, measured voice)
                 I can't know you right now.  It's not a good
                 time.

     Southern hangs up.

     INT.  COCKPIT - ILYUSHIN-76 CARGO PLANE.  DAY.

     YURI, hearing the response, explodes.

                             YURI
                      (gaping at the phone in disbelief)
                 Not a good time!

     Suddenly machine gun fire strafes the Ilyushin - bullets tearing
     through the fuselage, perilously close to Yurirs very combustible
     cargo.

He jots down the words as fast as they're said:

The transmission gets cut as the phone conversation ends.
Kris quickly rolls the chair across the room and grabs a map

               Accent lights come on, buried in the living room planters.

                 a good fight, I wouldn't be talking
                 to the same man.

     The Goateed Waiter approaches Jack and sets a refill soda
     down on the table.  The two of them briefly make eye contact.

                             JACK (V.O.)

     INT. PHOTOCOPY ROOM - DAY

     Jack stands over a copy machine, hit by flashes of light.
     He glances over his shoulder, watches Ricky, wearing an
     apron, push a supply cart.  Ricks nods at Jack.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 You weren't alive anywhere like you
                 were there.  But fight club only
                 exists in the hours between when
                 fight club starts and when fight club
                 ends.

     Jack, playing SOLITAIRE on his computer, daubs blood from

                 After fight club, everything else in

     Tyler shows Jack a LYE-BURNED KISS SCAR on his own hand.
     Tears begin to drip from Jack's eyes.  Tyler grabs a bottle
     of VINEGAR -- pours it over Jack's wound.

     Jack closes his eyes, holds his hand... slumps to the floor.

     There are bars of "The Paper Street Soap Company" soap on
     the counter.  Jack looks like he's half-expecting to get
     arrested.  His hand is BANDAGED.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Tyler sold the soap to department

               His uniforms and his civilian clothes. Hanging neatly along

                   In this city, if all the skeletons came
                   out of all the closets... if every un-
                   revenged corpse were to suddenly rise
                   and walk again, there would be no more
                   room for the living.

     Mills slumps back, crosses his arms, closes his eyes to sleep.

                                 MILLS
                   Don't try to tell me you didn't get that
                   rush tonight... that adrenalin.  Like we
                   were getting somewhere.
                           (pause)
                   And, don't try to tell me it was because
                   you thought we found something that
                   would play well in a courtroom.

     Somerset looks at Mills, puffs the cigarette.  The computer is
     heard: whir - click - whir - click...

     Somerset and Mills exit down the stairs.  Somerset's still
     searching, holding the list.  He spies a uniformed cop, DARIO.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Dario!  Come here.

     Dario runs up.  Somerset puts his hand on his shoulder and makes
     him walk with him.  Mills continues on to his car.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   According to the Father, this orphanage
                   wasn't around for more than five or six
                   years in the late fifties.  So, I want
                   someone to go to the Department of Child
                   Welfare or City Hall and dig up all the
                   records on this place.  Understand?

                                 DARIO
                   I got it.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Get a list of every child who attended
                   this orphanage before it shut down.  Get
                   it on my desk within the hour.

     Somerset releases Dario, who runs to obey.  Somerset goes to his
     own car.  Mills is driving to leave, stops, revs the engine.
     Somerset hands the computer list through the window.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   You thought of this all by yourself?
                   This was your brainstorm?

                                 MILLS
                   Yeah.  Is that so hard for you to
                   believe?

                                 SOMERSET
                   It's a pleasant surprise.

                   I'm not as stupid as I look.

     Mills peels away.  Somerset heads to his own car.

          I have a company: We design computer
          software to help companies in South
          American countries.that use an incompatible
          software, so the computers can't talk to
          each other. It's a big problem in Central
          and South America, where there is not
          usually so much coordination in computer
          communications. So right now there's a big
          opportunity for us, because for the big
          software companies it's still in the
          backwoods. That's changing already, but in
          the last ten years we have done extremely
          well. It's the next ten years we're going
          to see what happens.

                right back.
      
      He leaves Frank alone again.
      
      Frank stands and half-heartedly follows him to the
      doorway.
      
      He spots something in the adjoining room; a computer that
      has been left on. He wanders over and looks at the
      screen.
      
      An idea comes into Frank's head... he looks around. Nobody
      is watching him. He glances at the inscription on the
      WATCH...
      
      Then quickly sits down. He does a search for "WANTED
      INTERNATIONAL CRIMINALS" and types in the name:
      
      ALEXANDER PEARCE.
      
      An immediate hit in the data base. Alexander Pearce's
      page fills the screen. The caption reads:
      
      #6 on INTERPOL'S MOST WANTED LIST.
      
      In place of a photograph there is just a black outline of
      a man's head.
      
      Frank is about to scan for more information when he hears
      Domenico returning. He quickly steps back into the room
      where he was left...
      
      DOMENICO enters carrying a garish SWEAT SUIT.   He hands
      it to Frank.

               work from Roberta's class: a collection of eccentric abstract 
               bric-a-brac and Enid's large painting. The painting has drawn 
               a small crowd. We see a chain of events beginning with three 
               PARENTS talking to a matronly DIRECTOR/CURATOR who in turn 
               seeks out Roberta (wearing make-up and fancy-ish clothes for

                         have to take that painting down.

                      (yanking out another hair)
              God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?

                      (inspecting a hair follicle)
              Leave?  Just a few million years ago every atom in
              this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star.
              I don't see it as leaving.  I see it as going home.

                           EUGENE

     INT.  HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT.  DAY.

     JEROME is doing a late-minute cram on a geriatric computer from
     the late 1990's.  Checking the time, Jerome hurriedly picks up
     the shirt that EUGENE has been ironing from a prone position on
     the floor.

                           JEROME
              It's not too late to back out.

                           EUGENE
              You don't know what a relief it is not to
              be me.  Are you sure <i>you</i> want the job?

     Jerome contemplates the question for a moment.

                           JEROME
              What about you?  What's in this for you, Eugene?

                           EUGENE

              Listen, I bag this stuff anyway.  It may
              as well pay my rent.

     Jerome hurrise to the bathroom where, with some difficulty, he
     inserts his urine device for the first time.  The new improved
     Jerome emerges into the living room ready for his interview.

     JEROME, hesitating before adding it to the file.

     accompanied by DETECTIVE HUGO, DIRECTOR JOSEF and IRENE.

     places the key in a specimen bag and deposits it in his jacket.

          INT. STAGE - LATER

          Ira's on stage doing his act. He tells two jokes that don't
          do very well. And then he panics and does the joke about
          jerking off and shooting a movie all at the same time.
          ANGLE ON George, shaking his head, amused that he panicked
          and did one of the jokes he sold to him.
          CUT TO the wings of the stage.
          Ira's walking off stage.

          GEORGE
          What the fuck is that? You did
          three of the jokes that you wrote
          for me.

          IRA
          I panicked. They just wanted jokes
          about computers.

          GEORGE
          That's why I hired you, to write
          jokes about computers.
          Ira takes out the long list of jokes he's written.

          EXT. IMPROV -- NIGHT

          George and Ira are waiting at the parking valet. The car
          pulls up. As they get in:

          GEORGE
          I was thinking about it. I could
          throw you some money every week for
          coming up with new jokes for me.
          Maybe you can organize them in the
          computer, keep track of what I'm
          doing.

          IRA
          Absolutely. What do you want to
          pay me?
          They close the doors, drive off.

          GEORGE
          I'll throw you $1500 a week.

          IRA
          Okay, that could work.
          We can tell that this amount of money could change Ira's
          life.

          INT. GEORGE'S LIVING ROOM

          George and Ira are writing jokes. Ira keeps pitching
          premises/rough joke ideas that George instantly makes ten
          times better off the top of his head. (We shoot this process
          for real with multiple cameras and try to catch lightning in

          Well, you didn't have to, and you
          were really there for me. I was

          GEORGE
          There's nothing funny about being
          smart. All comedy comes from
          immaturity. Buster Keaton, Jerry
          Lewis, the Marx Brothers, WC
          Fields, Bill Murray, Steve Martin,
          Charlie Chaplin. They were all
          immature. They were all

             You're an awesome investigator,
             Inspector. Run his name on every
             database you can. I'll see you in

Grace hangs up. Makes notes on the sketch.       Slips it
into a picture frame.




INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - DAY

Grace, Reynaud and Laval look through a haystack of
computer printouts for needles of information. Grace
stretches. Grabs a donut from a box. Offers the box to
Laval.

             Fruit of the Gods. You know you
             want one.
Laval gives in, takes a plain cake. She offers donuts to
Reynaud. He rubs his eyes, shoves aside papers, quietly
to Laval:

                           INSPECTOR REYNAUD

                     (subtitled French)
             Let's take her down the street. I

Grace grabs her jacket and an armful of reports.







INT. BISTRO - DAY

Locals only. The Inspector's favorite spot, they are
like family here. Grace, Laval and Reynaud at a table in

             Very solid time of death. Two
             years ago.




                           GRACE

             So before he died he got his
             paychecks, paid his taxes.
             Patronized sporting goods stores.
             And had long spending gaps where
             he was enjoying the great
             outdoors. That pattern continues
             a year after his death. He gets
             some paychecks. Rents an
             apartment. Buys a three thousand
             dollar kayak. Pays his taxes.
             Dead and buried and still paying
             his taxes. Then everything stops.
             Last Visa charge was to
             Travelocity for a plane ticket to
             Mexico city.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Dead men don't pay their bills.
             It's identity theft.

                           GRACE

             This isn't someone renting limos
             and fancy dinners on someone
             else's credit. Lifestyle and
             habits don't change.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Computer error?

                           GRACE

             Too many independent systems.

                            INSPECTOR LAVAL

                     (beat)
             We work organized crime sometimes,
             maybe a hit man wanted to lay low.
             He assumed the life of a civilian
             until things cooled off.

                           GRACE

             You really think a gangster is
             going to break his stride and
             become a long hair groovy river
             guide? Inspector, this guy's
             whole life has been stolen.
             Someone killed him and became him.
             Down to profession and taste in
             clothing.
Laval and Reynaud trade looks.

Laval exits the room, shutting the door behind them. A
ROOKIE hands Director Gillet a cup of coffee and a new
dress shirt wrapped in plastic.

             Sure.   It's all on-line.
Grace takes an evidence bag containing the garrote from
the latest crime scene. She drops it in her computer
bag.
Grabs a case file.

             Call the Winnipeg Police and have

John Costa smiles at Grace as she enters.        Sets her bag

taxis to a gate at the FedEx SUPERHUB.  The Hub is a vast

Five thousand people work in a frenzy of interconnected

crisscrossing like a laser show.

Loaders quickly roll the container onto a FORKLIFT.

The forklift speeds inside one of the hangers to a LOADING
BELT, where our Box is spilled into a Mississippi River of
packages, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of them, all shapes and
sizes, from shoe boxes to engine blocks.  Large mechanical
arms divert the immense flow of Workers at dozens of
stations.  The packages surge and move.

The Workers place the packages label-side-up on new belts,
where they're scanned by laser readers.  Picking up speed our
Box is shunted across the acres of interlocking belts.

The Box ends up in a much larger CONTAINER labeled CDG.

Chuck is focused on his PowerBook with the screen away from

feels a little surreal, all those containers surrounding
them.

Stan comes over, looks at the image on the computer.  It's a
sailboat with some technical specifications under it.

Chuck struggles to put on his life jacket.  The plane is
VIBRATING VIOLENTLY.  He can't get the straps straight.  He
is KNOCKED against one wall, then another, then to the floor.

Chuck tries to blow on the mouth tubes for his life jacket.
Can't do it!  Puff.  Puff.  Shit!  John motions frantically
for Chuck to pull on the automatic inflators on his jacket.
Chuck fumbles for them.

Huge palettes shift and groan, one BREAKS FREE, banging
violently against the side of the plane, spilling out its
boxes.  Then it swings and KNOCKS Chuck on the head!  He goes
down!

INT.  GLOBAL OPERATIONS CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

A CONTROLLER mans the global operations desk.  His SUPERVISOR

Chuck is semi-conscious and bleeding from the head.  John

          Stupid fucking thing!

He quits, exhausted.  He looks at his hands.  They are raw
and blistered.  He feels like Job.

                     CHUCK
          I don't know what I did, God, but
          whatever is was, I am really, really
          sorry.  You hear me?  Really sorry.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

Chuck emerges from the jungle and walks to the edge of the
ocean.  He dips his blistered hands into the sea water, then
looks over at the FedEx boxes that spell out H E L P.

                     CHUCK
          Don't have a choice, do I?

He walks over and picks a few boxes up from the P.

EXT.  PALM GROVE - DAY

With his stone knife and spear to help him.  Chuck begins to
open the FedEx boxes.  Chuck rips open the end of one box and
shakes it.  Out tumble some videotapes.  Chuck looks at them:
what good are they?

Chuck tears another box open.  Out slide some legal papers
covered with Post-its.

In quick cuts, we see him dump out computer memory boards,
some designer dresses, flowers, a pair of roller blades, a
script with a red cover -- which he never reads.

EXT.  BEACH - LATER

By now he has taken all the boxes in the P.  Only H E L
remains.  He pauses to let the irony of that sink in, then
collects more boxes.  He is even more exhausted.

EXT.  PALM GROVE

Two boxes remain.  One is the box with Angel Wings.  Chuck
sets it aside.  He opens the other box.  Out tumbles a
DOCTOR'S BAG.  Chuck can't believe it.  He opens the bag.
It's full of great stuff.  Medicine.  A scalpel.  A saw.

                     CHUCK
          Okay.  Okay now.

EXT.  PALM GROVE - LATER

Hands bandaged, Chuck tries to strike a spark on the roller
blade wheel housing.  Tries over and over.  Nothing.

He takes a long drink from his canteen, and flinches.  His
tooth is starting to hurt.  He fishes some Tylenol out of the
surgeon's bag and takes two.

          was telling me about how the system
          they use for assigning roommates is
          kind of spooky. Like, the Freshmen

          used to be like 60%, and now it's

          A neat, well-appointed flat, tastefully decorated. Framed
          against a large window which looks out over the city, an
          elegant woman in her 70's: EVELYN GREENSLADE. She's on the
          phone, on hold.
          On the desk in front of her is a brand new laptop computer;
          the screen reads 'Getting Started ...'

          Special Agent Utah, this is not some
          job flippin' burgers at the drive-in.
          Yes, the surfboard bothers me.  Yes,
          your approach to this case bothers
          me.  And yes, you bother me.  You
          two have produced squat in the last
          two weeks, during which time the Ex-
          Presidents have robbed two more

          Nick glances up and spots LACEY, 20, coming up the drive
          toward him in a weensy bikini. Her body has more outcroppings
          than the coastline of Albania.
          She continues past him and embraces George.

                       Lacey is Dad's latest bimbette. She

                       room to look like Dolly Parton's

          Bernice sits next to Sheeni, despite the fact she's being

          nonchalantly.

                    she's falling asleep in class.
          Sheeni's head slips off her hand as she drifts off. We MOVE
          across the classroom to where Bernice scribbles in her
          notebook.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Since meeting you, I have come to
                    realize my interest in Sheeni was
                    only a transient adolescent
                    infatuation. I like you more than I
                    can say. Take courage. Together we
                    will outsmart these cake eaters.
          A view of the notebook shows her to be scribbling Nick's name
          with hearts. She flips through pages of obsession.

          Nick's fingers fly across the keys. He looks pleased with

          Great. Who doesn't? Let's say you like
          her so much, you want to know every
          movie where she shows her tits. And
          not just that, but how long into that
          movie she shows her tits. Come to our
          web page, exclusively, type in `Meg
          Ryan.' Bam! `In the Cut,' thirty-eight
          minutes in, forty-eight minutes in,

          like naked that whole fuckin' movie.
          She does full-frontal in that movie.

	NICOLE is in the car in front of the community centre.  She
	stares at SAM as he argues with MITCHELL on the steps.

				NICOLE
				(voice over)
		Daddy took a long time.  I guess he
		wanted to have a few words with you.
		He must have tried to tell you that
		I was lying.  Then you would tell
		Daddy that it didn't matter if I was
		lying or not, the lawsuit is dead.

	As NICOLE'S words are heard, her point of view of SAM and
	MITCHELL arguing is seen.

		Everyone's lawsuit is dead.  Forget
		it.  Tell the others to forget it.
		It's over.  Right now, Sam, the

		why she lied.  A kid who'd do that
		to her own father is not normal,

	at the driver's seat.  NICOLE stares at him as he starts the

John turns back to the open hatch.
Machine recirculated air flows out.

A glass and metal COFFIN -- pneumatic piping twines around its
base.  The glass lid is BROKEN.  A Small RED LIGHT pulses at the

warning -- is audible...

		Seal broken...seal broken...

John finds himself moving towards the tube...
Looks through the broken lid:

IN THE TUBE

There is a splattered BLOOD STAIN on the sterile white
interior.  OLD, turned rust-brown.
Whatever happened here happened a while ago.
Rust colored drips trail down to --

THE FLOOR

Drag marks.  His eyes follow the stains to a pile of
Bloody clothing against a control panel.  A jumpsuit.  Torn.
Child size.  The head of child's DOLL, but no body to be found.

Looks back towards the door.
Part of him wants to get the hell out here -- but he fights
back his fear.  He is a doctor - or trying to be - someone
in here may need his help.  He presses forward -- 
Averts his gaze from the clothing, UP to the blinking and
glowing instrument panels and their myraid -- 

LIGHTS

Pressure lights.  Data lights.  Warning lights.
Thousands of lights.  Like the stars in the sky.

It's been decades since he's seen technology like this -- and
never this close up.  He steps further into the ship, his fear
now replaced by fascination, follows the lights....

		When we left Earth seventy years ago, it

		Technology was on the verge of destroying
		the planet's environment.  A computer virus
		was threatening to wipe away all recorded
		knowledge.  There didn't seem to be any
		way it could be averted.  In the almost
		forty years since we were towed out here
		in hypersleep, the news that came with 
		occasional supply ships only got worse.
		Finally, the ships stopped coming.  We 
		had to resign ourselves to the fact that
		worst had come to pass, and the Earth
		no longer existed.

		The order was more of a counter culture,

          You have to.
          She looks at him', sees his desperation.

          SAME - MOMENTS LATER
          Jonathan is flipping through the stack of photocopies, then
          halts on one. He stares at it. The Receptionist peers over.

          RECEPTIONIST
          That's him? He was real cute. Only he
          wasn't a lawyer. He was a systems analyst,
          I think. He was here for a few days to
          work on the computers.
          RECEPTIONIST'S POV: of the photocopy in Jonathan's hand. It's
          of a Massachusetts Driver's License. Staring back up at us is
          Wyatt's smiling face.

          RECEPTIONIST
          I thought you said his name was Wyatt?
          PAN TO THE NAME beside the photo: Sansky. WilliamR.

          CLOSE ON JONATHAN'S LAPTOP SCREEN as an internet search
          engine runs the name: "Bansky, William." A page of some 200+
          matches is returned. Jonathan readies himself, then dives in.
          Beside the keyboard rests the receptionist's photocopy of
          William Bansky's Massachusetts driver's license. We see
          Detective Russo's business card resting a few inches away.

          ON JONATHAN - MOMENTS LATER
          Checking URLs site by site. He finally pauses on one. It's an
          article from the Boston Herald. The headline: "POLICE HAVE
          FEW CLUES TO YOUNG EXECUTIVE'S DISAPPEARANCE." As Jonathan
          scans the article, we glimpse some lines of text:

          What about William Bansky? Does that name--
          She darts.for the "Door Open" button, but he blocks her path.

          I swear to God I'll scream.

          Please, I'm not trying to scare you, I

          she tries to push past him, again Jonathan blocks her.

          JONATHAN
          He does this too - or he did. someone had
          to give him the numbers. Someone let him
          in. If I can-'find who it was that knew
          him, they might know where he's                                 --
          she suddenly kicks him in the shin with a spiked heel.
          Jonathan grasps his leg - she presses the button and is out
          the opening doors before he's even looked up.

          Bundled in her ski jacket, Solange is closing up her shop for
          the night, stacks of flowers in her arms, when she notices
          Jonathan coming down the front steps.

          SOLANGE
          Jonathan, you're home early -
          Only when he looks up, she finds the young man in the
          overcoat isn't Jonathan. It's Wyatt.

          SOLANGE
          Oh - je suis desole. My mistake.
          Wyatt flashes her an icy smile, continues down the steps.
          Solange watches him walk away, a puzzled look on her face.

          Huddled over a computer, Jonathan typing, eyes red from
          exhaustion and stress as we hear his recall:

          JONATHAN (V.0.)
          who's James Getz?

          WYATT (V.0.)
          A guy I roomed with freshman year at
          Princeton.
          on Jonathan's monitor we see he's on a web site for Princeton
          University alumni. He types in: Getz, James.
          A beat - then: "No match." A long list of G names follows.
          Jonathan scrolls down the list, but there's no Getz.

          JONATHAN
          Shit.
          Jonathan exhales, about to log off - when a name among the
          H's jumps out at him: Holloway. Reed.
          Jonathan stares at it tensely - then clicks on the name.
          "Sort no contact information available."
          Jonathan thinks a moment - then tries a search engine, types:
          "Holloway Reed" then decides to add the word "missing."
          An article appears. From the Chicago Tribune: "BODY OF
          MISSING BUSINESSMAN FINALLY DISCOVERED." A head-shot style
          photograph shows a man in his early 40s whom we recognize
          from Black Business Suit's story. Beneath his photo, his
          name: "Reed Holloway."

             Look where? Please tell me.
             Everyone knows who Meeks is and is
             looking for him. The chiropractor
             was the last link to his old life
             that I know of. The only way we'll
             find him, now, is if someone turns
             him in or we trip over him at a bus
             stop. On the other hand, Detective
             Snyder, no one knows who the
             Thumbprint Killer is or where he
             is. However, I have a fucking hunch
             this guy Baffert does. I have two
             days to play that hunch. If you
             feel like you're wasting your time
             with me, I'd be happy to do it
             alone.

He looks at her and shakes his head.

             No. She would have said that.

looks at the computer screen.

             later there were Movers here. Musta

INT. MR. SMITH'S APARTMENT � NIGHT

On her way in, Atwood draws her gun.

Keeping close to the walls she audits the KITCHEN. All the
Cabinet doors are open. Dishes, pots and pans, cutlery, gone.

She moves on to the BATHROOM. Soap, shampoo, toilet paper,
toothpaste, toothbrushes, towels, washcloths, the contents of
the Medicine Cabinet, gone.

She moves on to the BEDROOM. Bed, night table, lamps, T.V.,
computer, gone. Clothes closets, empty of everything.

She looks around. Mr. Smith's entire Apartment has been
stripped absolutely clean, except...

... there's a crumpled piece of paper in the far corner of
the Bedroom.

Atwood goes over and gets down on one knee. With her fingers
pulling at the corners she is able to straighten the paper
enough to make out that it's a work order from a Moving
company.

Diamond sits in the President's study - book-lined walls, a fire in the
hearth. A group of men sit on the sofasthe Surgeon-General, the Chief of
Staff, the National Security Advisor, the Secretaw of Health. A table is
littered with graphs end files.

We've got five thousand cases now, Mr President. That's in three weeks. The
number is doubling every hundred and sixty-eight hours.

The President stands near a window, half in shadow, the firelight playing
across his face. He's in his 50's but the strain of office makes him look
older.

That's a geometric progression, sir. In three months there'Il be over seven
million cases. After that we hit the wall -

She pushes a thick, bound volume across the table.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

According to this, there won't be a live birth on the planet.

The President looks at her for a moment. Then he reaches down and picks up
the bound volume. It's hundreds of pages of numbers and projections.

These are just computer projections -

there's a make-shift bed and a hot-plate with a battered saucepan. Next to

Will is sit'ting in front of three computers running in parallel - data and
equations reel across them. The caretaker comes out of the shadows,
carrying two mugs of thick coffee. He puts one down next to Will -

You wanna tell me what exactly you're doing?

Looking for a date.

The caretaker stares at the confusion of diagrams and equations on the

What's wrong with a calendar?

These are chemical sequences - they represent human genes. By following a

change occurred in something called the mitochondrial DNA.

WILL (CONT'D)

(softly)

Yeah - I've found it.

CARETAKER

So - what's the date?

Will presses a key. Faster than the eye can follow, the first long-chain
molecule starts to shift and mutate. Finally it resolves itself into the
second molecule. Will looks at a graph on the side of the screen -

WILL

The best computer science can do? One hundred and two thousand years ago.

Sort of what I figured - give or take a day or two.

Diamond is poring through scientific articles written by Will. She flicks a
page -there's a photo of Will, 20 years younger, surrounded by three
colleagues. He's got his arm around one of them - an attractive young
woman.

Diamond lifts the photo, looking at it more closely. She starts to read the
caption. We push in on it and hold on the words... "UC Berkeley".

swooping and soaring - through a weird landscape of towering cliffs,
tumbling streams and primordial forest. There's something unreal about it -

He spirals down a tunnel - into a whirlpool of white light. As he hits, it
shatters into a million fragments of light. It looks like a comet, wheeling

CABLE GUY
I come here to think sometimes. To clear
my head.

They turn a corner and the satellite dish is right in front of them. It is enormous. Next to it is a 
one-hundred and fifty foot antenna. Next to that is a small fenced-in shack where the satellite's 
controls are located.

CABLE GUY
There she is. Right now she's sending
entertainment and information to millions
of satisfied citizens.

STEVEN
That's pretty impressive.

CABLE GUY
See, I knew the moment I met you that
you would appreciate this.

The Cable Guy runs to the dish. A few seconds later he appears inside of it.

CABLE GUY
(with wonder)
The future is now. Soon every American
home will integrate their television,
phone, and computer. You'll be able to
visit the Louvre on one channel, and
watch female mud wrestling on
another. You can do your shopping at
home, or play Mortal Kombat with a friend
in Vietnam. There's no end to the
possibilities.
(waves to Steven)
Come on up! What are you waiting for?!

22	INT. SATELLITE DISH - NIGHT

The Cable Guy and Steven are lying in the middle of the dish, looking up at the night sky.

CABLE GUY
Sometimes I'll sit here and imagine that
there are billions of bits of information
surging through me.

STEVEN
I've watched a lot of TV in my life. I
guess I've always taken it for granted.

CABLE GUY
When I was a kid my mom worked nights.
Never met dad. But the old TV was always
there for me.

Work's good.

ROBIN
How's Hal?

STEVEN
Don't get me started. That guy has no
vision. It's like working for Mr. MaGoo.
He's just worthless.

ROBIN
It's just great that you're getting to do
it. It's a real step up.

STEVEN
I know. Now if only someone at corporate
smartened up enough to dump Hal, then I
could really get some stuff done.

The sccene starts again. It is on a loop. Steven is aghast. He looks up and sees the scene is playing 
on every computer in the office. He gets a panicked look on his face. Is Hal seeing this? He runs 
out of his office to prevent Hal from viewing this.

81B	OFFICE BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS

Steven runs to the edge of the stairs and looks down.

STEVEN'S P.O.V. - He sees Hal downstairs, walking into his office.

BACK TO STEVEN - He runs down the stairs towards Hal's office as fast as he can.

81C	INT. HAL'S OFFICE

Steven walks in. Hal is sitting behind his desk staring angrily at the computer. He looks up and 
sees Steven.

HAL
Don't worry. I didn't see it --- 'cause I
have no vision.

Steven knows what's coming.

RICK
Steven? Steven?

In the distance he sees Steven standing in the shadows.

STEVEN
Hey Rick. I'm really excited to hear
what you found out about this nut.

RICK
I hit the Holy Grail. This guy is deeply
troubled. Only child. His mother was
arrested for prostitution, and phone
solicitation. Apparently she was some
phone sex pioneer.

STEVEN
No way.

RICK
And get this, he was discharged from the
Marines. He got mad at his Sergeant so
he sent a weapons silo to Defcon Two
using a Radio Shack computer. And that's
not the half of it.

As Rick gets closer Steven steps forward out of the shadows, and we reveal that it is not Steven, 
but the Cable Guy, dressed like Steven, doing a perfect impression (actually the real voice of 
Steven looped into the Cable Guy's mouth - with a very slight lisp).

CABLE GUY
Really? Tell me more.

Rick's face turns white. He stumbles backwards, trying to get away.

CABLE GUY
I'm very interested in learning
everything I can about that wacked out
cable installer.

He turns and runs. He is fifteen feet away from the Cable Guy.

The camera pushes in on the Cable Guy. He pulls out a staple gun, and fires. We hear but do not 
see Rick yelp, and fall.

CABLE GUY
It sounds like he might hurt somebody.

Steven is driving in his car. His cellular phone rings. He picks it up.

117	EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

The chase continues.

Steven slams on the gas, until he is driving one-hundred miles-per-hour. He weaves in and out of 
traffic, running stop lights, and avoiding obstacles. The police cars disappear behind him. On a 
dime, Steven turns left onto a residential street and shuts off his lights. A moment later all of the 
police cars pass by. Steven pulls out and heads the other way.

ROBIN
This is really fascinating, but I really
think we ought to go now.

CABLE GUY
I knew you'd appreciate it. I took
Steven here once, and he didn't give a
rats ass about my interests.

          Okay.   I respect that.

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          My dad is actually a fireman, or
          was, I don't know. He got injured
          like two years ago, and now they
          just pay him out of, like,
          insurance. He doesn't do anything,
          I mean he goes out during the day,
          but I don't know where. He drinks
          a lot.

                    STEVE
          So how do you pay for your shit?

                    ANDREW (O.S.)
          I do computer repair, and stuff.     I
          actually make a lot of money...

                    STEVE
          What about your mom.

                     ANDREW (O.S.)
          My mom has spinal meningitis, she's-
          she can't work or anything, and the
          insurance doesn't cover all of her
          medicine, so a lot of my money has
          to go into that. I figure if I get
          enough on camera, maybe I can, I
          dunno, get custody of her or
          something.

Steve mulls this over.
                                                   CUT.

                    STEVE
          I've actually been having some
          problems with my parents, too.

    The frame is filled with the face of PETER SULLIVAN, a 27-
    year-old risk assessment analyst. He has a Doctorate from MIT
    and is staring intently into a large bank of computer
    screens.

    An elevator door opens and FOUR HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE come
    out of the elevator carrying large file boxes. They walk down
    a long glass enclosed hallway that runs the full length of
    the trading floor. The scope of the floor now comes into
    frame. There are more computers than can be imagined and
    several large boards on the far walls that are scrolling
    thousands of numbers. PETER gives a knowing glance to the guy
    sitting next to him, SETH BREGMAN, a young analyst in his
    early twenties.

                        SETH
              Is that them?

                           PETER

                        SETH
              Jesus Christ.

    The HUMAN RESOURCES people turn and separate into a large
    glass walled conference room that runs along the floor as
    almost every person on the floor watches.

                        SETH (cont'd)
              Are they going to do it right there?

                           PETER
              Yeah.

    The HR people begin walking out onto the floor looking at a
    piece of paper in their hand then walking up behind a person
    and asking their name. It is brutal. The camera follows one
    HR woman, HEATHER, with her piece of paper down the hall and
    into a row of employees, she walks right past the THREE GUYS
    then stops a bit down from them.

                           HEATHER
                 Timothy Singh?

                              TIMOTHY
                 Yes.

                           HEATHER
                 I'm afraid we have to speak with you.

    TIM gets up and walks back towards the conference room with
    the woman. PETER puts on his headphones and very loud RAP
    MUSIC drowns out all other noise and PETER tries to get lost
    back into the numbers on his computer screen.

    The sequence follows the HR people walking around and firing
    people intercut with PETER just staring at his computer
    screen. It runs for almost the length of the song until
    finally the same woman comes walking back down the hall and
    stops behind PETER and taps him on the shoulder. He takes off
    his headphones and the MUSIC STOPS. He is shell-shocked.

                              HEATHER (cont'd)

                 Eric Dale?

                              PETER
                 No.

                  I am.

     SETH walks out and PETER puts on his headphones, the MUSIC
     kicks in again. He picks up the portable hard drive, looks
     around and sees no one, then inserts it into his computer. He
     has four large screens in front of him and as he begins
     opening window upon window of mathematical models his face
     begins to soften and he gets into his comfort zone. The frame
     is filled with the extremely complex programs and numbers
     flying by.

                  for what... pushing some numbers around
                  on a computer screen, so a bunch of
                  glorified crack addicts could take that

We see a newspaper clip, where Allison's ad has been highlighted
with a felt-pen red rectangle. It says :

       apartment in west 70s. Non-smoker

She walks to a table with an Apple computer on it, puts her glass

choices, �Cancel� or �OK�. Allison chooses �OK�. �Fontana

       Look.

Close up on the screen. A data chart titled �Fontana Fashions� has
appeared. The extreme left column is labelled �Expenses�, and
underneath, a list of all the expenses (Lease - Telephone -
Payroll - Liabilities... and son on). The other columns on the
right are labelled �Jan� to �Apr�, and underneath lists of numbers
corresponding to the various monthly expenses.

But, the data chart has hardly appeared on the screen that the
columns of numbers start erasing themselves one by one, starting
with January.

       BARBARA
       It's erasing.

Then, when all the numbers have been erased, a window appears on
the screen with �LOST!� written in red letters in it.

Another data chart appears on the screen : the expenses from May
to August. And, on this chart, the columns of numbers also start
to erase themselves.

Mitchell looks severely at Barbara. She raises her hands.

       BARBARA
       I didn't do anything.

Suddenly, Mitchell seems to remember something.

       MITCHELL
       Shit !

He runs away toward his office.

The blonde woman is standing in the doorway of the office.
Mitchell brutally pushes her away.

3.49 INT. COUNCIL HOUSE � EVENING

AUSTEN (12) plays Skyrim on a brand new Mac PowerBook. The hi-
tech, futuristic sheen of the Apple is utterly at odds with
the room Austen is in: money seems to be in short supply here.

Austen is a cut and paste hoodie: a white boy going nowhere.

JADEN (18, white) enters. Lean and strong, Jaden is savvy �
but drugs have left their mark on his face and in his eyes.

                            JADEN
               What the fuck, my fam . . .

He grabs the Mac from Austen. They push and pull for it.

                            AUSTEN
               No way! Fuck off now, brah!

Jaden whacks Austen around the head � light, but hard enough
to break his grip. Jaden puts the computer to one side; the
way he handles it suggests that replacing it would be a synch.

Austen attacks him, but Jaden restrains him.

Austen makes for the Mac again, but Jaden restrains him.

They fight a moment, but it's futile: Austen pulls back,
humiliated and outraged. He kisses his teeth and birds.

                            JADEN

She kisses his forehead and exits the room.

Uri re-opens the Window on his computer. He looks out of the

He swigs from a bottle of JD that he retrieves from a drawer.

He turns back to the computer, reads what he's written.

3:07AM, the clean cut 14-year-old flips to his side.

A poster of Lee Ving of FEAR onstage, taped to the wall.
Pre-Calculus and Biology books on the floor. Cassettes

It hangs above a serious computer and next to a giant,

orgasm.

TIGHT ON DEREK VINYARD. The young man has a shaved head,
a thick goatee, and a well-crafted SWASTIKA on his left
tit. On top of Derek in the bed is his barely-of-age
girlfriend, STACEY. The covers are completely off and a
BLACK ROSE is tattooed across her right shoulder blade.
Danny watches her fuck, only for a second.

Danny walks over and shakes him. Startled, Derek
forcefully grabs his little brother's arm.

Derek and onto her side.

There's a black guy outside Der...

mattress, pulls out a SIG .45 semi-automatic pistol, and
shoves in a clip.

THE BROAD EXPANSE OF AN EMPTY, DIMLY LIT PARKING LOT. In
the distant corner we see a few parked cars and a group
of skins gathering.

          DANNY (V/O)
It was lunacy after he left us. All
the time. Derek believed in
Cammeron...he was angry...that
combination gave them bodies. White
punks...sick of gettin' their asses
kicked by black and mexican gangs at
school.

TIGHT ON DANNY LEANING AGAINST AN ADJACENT CAR.

Seven skins, including Seth and Curtis, smoke and wait.

convicted and sentenced to seven years
for voluntary manslaughter...to be
served at the California State
Penitentiary in Chino.

Rasmussen forces Derek's head down and he gets in the
car. He stares at his brother and sister as police
lights flash on him. Then to Stacey. Finally, to a
lifeless Doris. They lock eyes as the patrol car takes
off down the street.

          DANNY (V/O)
Prosecutors wanted murder one for my
brother's torture method...but there
wasn't enough "premeditated" evidence.

INT. BEDROOM - DANNY'S EYES

They clearly focus on the computer. HIGHLIGHTED is the
sentence "There might have been if I testified." Only
when he hits the DELETE KEY does it disappear. He
continues typing.

                   DANNY (V/O)
               (continuing)
          Over the next year we'd lose our house
          and the rest of our father's pension
          to attorney fees. My mother...much to
          all of our surprise...stood by Derek.

Danny's interrupted by a LOUD KNOCK on the front door.

INT. FRONT HALL - DANNY'S POV

He looks through the PEEPHOLE and sees it's CHRIS AND
JASON. He sighs in relief and opens the door.

We're here, dude.

puts his arm around Dan and they go into the bedroom.

Are you going in there?

Derek looks down to see Lizzy and Kammi.

          LIZZY
Can you tell Danny that Lizzy's
looking for him?

Derek can only stare at the girl's youth.

INT. LARGE BEDROOM/OFFICE - A SHRINE TO HITLER

DEREM'S PoV. He stands in the doorwell and listens.
White Power paraphernalia cover the walls. Articles,
posters, everything. The room has a bed, a couch, a
glass coffee table and a desk with a computer on it.
Organized stacks of papers, pamphlets and magazines are
strewn throughout the floor. Cameron sips a beer and
talks with Dan. Stacey listens in the background.

              CAMMERON
He won't do anything'drastic I hope.

              DANNY
I gotta do that paper though.

          CAMMERON
I thought you already turned that
fucker in?

          DANNY
My teacher cried to Sweeney, man.

                    Diagnostic Computer's down. We've got
                    some work to do.

          Gus eats a cheeseburger. Jim and Aurora sit across from him.

                        (with his mouth full)
                    Never been so hungry. Worst
                    hibernation hangover ever.
          Jim can't take his eyes off Gus. A new person.

                    Good night, Gus.
          Gus waves and walks off. That leaves Jim and Aurora sitting
          awkwardly on the same side of a diner booth.
          After a moment Aurora moves over to the other side. Looks at
          Jim across the table.

          Jim puts the pedal down. The cart lays rubber on the deck
          plates and shoots down the aisle while Aurora and Gus yell.

          Hands them to Aurora, who hands them to Jim, who loads them
          into the cart.

          Gus clamps a final component in place and nods at Jim.

          Jim closes a circuit breaker and powers up the computer. A
          deep electrical HUM as the machine boots up.
          The screen flashes a message: RUNNING VESSEL DIAGNOSTIC. A
          progress bar shows that the diagnostic is 0.0% complete.
          The lights on the indicator panel remain dark. The first
          light begins to flicker as the diagnostic runs.

          A roar of THUNDER. The caged sun shudders. Tongues of fire

          Aurora extends her hand to Jim. He takes her hand, and with
          his other hand grabs a handhold. Aurora floats up and grabs
          the replacement core computer by a cable. A human chain, they
          haul it down to the deck.
          Aurora holds the new computer down. Jim floats up to the
          ruined old computer. Opens latches. Disconnects cables. Eases
          the machine out of the column into the air.
          The room shakes. A deep note in the background falls silent.

          disappearing into the ceiling.
          Jim rushes to a CONSOLE. Scans the display.

    His hair still wet from the shower, Sam sits before a COMMS
    UNIT, dressed in a "Lunar Industries" boiler suit, a zip up
    the front, colorful patches sewn into the arms. He begins
    to record a message.

                        SAM
              Tess. Hi. It's me. How are you,
              sweetheart? It's the morning
              here. In a few minutes Gerty and
              I will sit down for breakfast, go
              over the day's itinerary.

    As Sam continues his message, we are given a TOUR of the
    mining base. Beginning with:


5   INT. MONITORING STATION                                       5

    This is where you want to be if the shit hits the fan. The
    base's equivalent of HQ. A wall of computers and flickering
    digital displays.

                        SAM (V.O.)
              Today begins my 154th week on
              Selene. I officially have two
              weeks to go before I climb into
              that Return Vehicle...


6   INT. RETURN VEHICLE                                           6

    A small space craft attached to the base. It is essentially
    a tiny room with a coffin like, sealed bed in the middle of
    it: a cryogenic POD with an array of complicated controls
    surrounding it.

                        SAM (V.O.)
              And blast home.


7   INT. REC ROOM                                                 7

    Sam spends most of his time here. It is kitchen and play
    room combined. We PICK OUT a television set, an armchair, a
    Ping-Pong table, the treadmill.

               There were times, as you know...

     We go even CLOSER to the model, seeing that there are
     actual people, actual characters in the little town; actual
     buildings: a CHURCH, a TOWN HALL, etc. Clearly someone has
     put a ton of work into this thing.

                         SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               ...when I thought I was going to
               crack up.

     And the tour of the base continues. Onto a new room. A dark         
     storage area Sam has repurposed to grow a handful of                
     plants. They sit surrounded by darkness, glowing under              
     pools of artificial light.

               But I think I've come out the
               other side now.


9    INT. INFIRMARY                                                9

     A strange angular room, obviously purposeful, but its               
     design more geared to a computer than a human being. A              
     single bed dominates.                                               

                         SAM (V.O.)
               In many ways, this place is all
               about contradictions.


10   EXT. LUNAR LANDSCAPE                                          10

     The empty terrain surrounding the mining base, as viewed
     from the Monitoring Station window. Across the landscape a
     mountain rises from the morning shadows.

                         SAM (V.O.)
               It's bleak, it's beautiful.

          to an elegant woman in her fifties, who looks like she's in her
          forties and could actually pass for late thirties. She strides
          towards reception, a Porter struggling to keep up with her. This
          is Jenna Hopkins. Head of a notorious London Crime Family. Mother
          of both Julian and Billy. Newly appointed Lady Macbeth of Bangkok.
          She hands her passport over to the Concierge.

                          JENNA
           I'd like to check in now please.
          The Concierge checks the computer.

           I'm afraid the room won't be ready until
           four o'clock.
          Beat... Jenna just stares at him...

                          CONCIERGE (CONT'D)
           ... It's policy

                          JENNA
           I'd like to speak to your manager.
          Beat.

                          CONCIERGE
           Yes of course...
          The Concierge retreats. Jenna lights a cigarette.

          crowds, passing various stalls that seem to sell anything you
          could ever want for your TV, computer or Hi-fi.
          Gunman Three is so scared that he keeps forgetting the route and
          fretting about which way to turn at every junction in the
          warren-like market.

          As soon as Li Po sees Chang and his crew arrive with Gunman Three
          next to them he knows the game's up. He can't run. His kid's sitting

       He spins around, startled. He only catches a glimpse of THE

       Reaching the foyer, Gary steps on a

       RAT TRAP,

       which SNAPS down on his toes. He SCREAMS, pulling it off.
       He looks around to find all eight traps are now on the main
       floor, rather than the second-floor walkway.

       Limping, he hops out the door.     We stay behind, looking out
       through the open door.

heart of the generator, an assemblage of DNA elements.  Then the cells move
down a tube, like a fluid, and gather in an imprint of a HUMAN body.  Step
by step bones are reconstructed, then the nervous and muscular systems.
Whole veins wrap around the muscles.  An entire body is reconstructing before
our very eyes.

               Moments later.

               Simon is alone in the room with his bed.

               various accessories and a couple of coffees.

               He lets himself in and dumps the computer on the kitchen 
               counter.

               Simon is asleep on the couch, still in his clothes.

                         Come on. I got ya some coffee.

               Henry trudges back to the kitchen, where he whips out his 
               red pen and immediately begins to correct Simon's poem.

               Simon rolls off the couch and makes his way to the table.

                         In the infinite amplitude of his 
                         love, God wants to create the largest

                         exist together in one cosmos... OK.

                         In an instantaneous calculation made 
                         in eternity, God computes the best 
                         possible world and creates it. Fine. 
                         This 'decision' by God is uncontingent 
                         and eternal rather than temporally

   road.  Neighbors are double-wide trailers.  The house has
   some sophisticated radio antennas as well as a twelve-foot
   satellite dish.  On the driveway are two Escalades and a
   Bentley.  Out the back, off the dock is a two-million dollar
   sports/fishing boat.  Someone's entering numbers on a cell
   phone.

   waits.  The guy working the cell phone is the buzz-cut Aryan
   Brother we saw in the Stevens kitchen in the opening.
   Coleman's shirt open in the Barcalounger watching ESPN.  His
   watch is loaded with ice, and a four-carat diamond in his
   ear.  He is all white bling.  Coleman's tattooed up.  Not
   with "cool" Celtic symbols...his tats are neo-Nazi, white
   supremacist, hard-core prison stuff.

   Coleman takes the satellite phone, attached to a laptop.  He
   enters a number.  A frequency-response graphic displays in

               for words. She tightens his helmet ring, and he brushes his 
               gloved fingertips on her faceplate. Then he hurries towards 
               the inner hatch door, where McConnell is throwing airlock 
               switches. Woody and McConnell exchange a look.

               At the EVA computer panel, Phil is shutting down non-essential

               frustration builds.

               Terri, staring at the ceiling, sees something remarkable.

               THE SODA STREAM

               Swirling ever tighter, has formed a whirlpool that's now 
               being sucked out through the breach hole in the hull. She 
               can now see the ugly puncture for the first time.

                                     MCCONNELL
                              (gasping)
                         Woody, the breech is in sector four! 
                         Sector four, copy that?

                         Copy, I' heading there now.

               Terri turns, excited by McConnell's triumph; she's just in 
               time to see him collapse to the floor below her, as he starts 
               to lose consciousness. He's deathly pale.

               Woody spots a tiny geyser of brownish ice crystals spouting 
               out of the hull of the lower Hab. It's some distance away 
               from him, but clearly visible.

                         the simulator.

               INT. LOWER HAB. NIGHT

               Terri pushes off from the ladder, drifting weightlessly down 
               to McConnell. She opens the valve of the oxygen cannister, 
               pushing the plastic mask over McConnell's face. He sucks in 
               air, color returning to his skin as he revives.

               fingers -- both hands now -- probe desperately through them.

                                     PHIL

               PHIL WINCES WITH PAIN.

               As he moves his hands and forearms deep inside the computer 
               bay. Around him, several of the smaller screens and gauges 
               are starting to malfunction, the data streams breaking apart, 
               streaking into electronic snow. He shoots a tense glance at

               THE NAVIGATIONAL MONITOR

               Which is flickering crazily. It shows the ship moving much 
               closer to its critical MOI point, indicated by a flashing 
               red triangle aimed down at the Martian surface.

               PHIL TAKES A DEEP BREATH.

               Says a silent prayer. Then he yanks the plug. SHRILL WHINES, 
               ELECTRONIC CRACKLES from all around him, as the systems are 
               abruptly shut down, in a way they were never meant to be 
               mishandled. Terrifyingly, a couple of the monitors arc to 
               each other as they die. Dodging sparks, Phil stares at

               THE NAVIGATIONAL MONITOR

               As it also flickers and dies. Now they're flying blind.

               looming as large as Earth, when seen from the space shuttle. 
               The ship's motion is mercifully slowing as it hits the outer 
               atmosphere, but just as clearly this steep, unplanned angle

               The REMO is now on the night side of Mars. Cargo boxes, 
               packing cases and assorted equipment containers float outside. 
               The hatch is sealed.

               INT. REMO. MARS ORBIT. NIGHT

               McConnell hovers by a bulkhead. He's anguished, haunted by 
               the image of Woody's death. We see him struggling to overcome 
               his grief and shock, trying to force himself to concentrate 
               on the critical tasks at hand. In front of him, a panel has 
               been opened; he's facing

               SMALL UTILITY MONITOR

               Already glowing, surrounded by coded switches, indicator 
               lights, com ports.

               MCCONNELL

               Stares at these, thinking hard, remembering. He's holding a 
               palm-sized computer, already wired into this panel. He begins 
               tapping the keys, but then stops himself. Reconsiders. He 
               turns, looking back at

               TERRI AND PHIL

               Hunched on what would be the floor if the REMO were on land. 
               They grip stowage straps to keep from drifting. Clearly this 
               tiny, rude cargo craft was never designed for manned 
               operation. It's claustrophobic, bitterly cold.

               PHIL'S FACE

               Is a map of torment. He is shivering, both from cold and 
               fear, barely holding himself together. He hugs his computer 
               supply case like a scared child would hug a teddy bear.

               TERRI

               Is worse. A thousand-yard stare. She's in shock.

               MCCONNELL

               Knows he has to occupy them. Speaks softly.

               pauses to look at the table from which Luke and his crew 
               taped their final, fateful message.

               HIS BIRTHDAY CUPCAKE

               Still sits there, eerily, with its stub of burned-out candle. 
               Half-finished, frozen cups of coffee. Suddenly, out of the 
               corner of his eye, he catches a flash of white. He spins, 
               startled, and sees

               Still sits there, eerily, with its stub of burned-out candle. 
               Half-finished, frozen cups of coffee. Suddenly, out of the 
               corner of his eye, he catches a flash of white. He spins,

               As he trembles with excitement. With sudden comprehension.

               Luke and Terri stand behind him. McConnell's energy, his new 
               certainty, is almost electrifying.

                         It's asking us for the right answer. 
                         It wants us to put in the missing 
                         pair of chromosomes.

                         Don't move! Keep this orientation.

               The three scared, helmeted faces seem to float in the 
               brightness, some twenty feet apart.

               Phil, saying a silent prayer, reaches over and turns on the 
               main computer. It works! He's immensely relieved.

                         visibility here.

               He glances out the cockpit window at the blowing dust. Then 
               realizes that he's hearing only silence over his radio.

               McConnell is staring at his spacesuit's sleeve. He can see 
               that the suit material is starting to deflate, revealing the 
               shape of his arm, just as it did in Luke's greenhouse. He 
               hesitates, then begins to unscrew the sealing ring on his

               behind them. The sky is purplish black, thick with flying 
               debris and eerie lightning flashes. Towering billows of dust 
               chase them over the plain, nearly enveloping them as they 
               speed towards us, passing OUT OF FRAME.

               Fights against a stab of claustrophobia. Is he being 
               imprisoned? Or somehow protected? Either way, he's virtually 
               immobilized. In this tight space in his bulky suit, he can't 
               even move his arms. Only his head and neck can still shift.

               Phil is going over his final pre-launch checklist, flipping

               neck, looking down.

               A COBALT-BLUE TRANSPARENT LIQUID

               Is beginning to fill the cylinder! It swirls in, from some 
               unknown source, rising rapidly; already his lower boots are 
               covered.

               MCCONNELL'S EYES

               Widen in alarm. He strains against the sides of the cylinder 
               but

               Slide helplessly across the smooth surface.

               The entire "ceiling" of the Face is becoming translucent. He

               into this, are fiery coils of energy from the Face itself. 
               These swirl and twist in every direction, like angry water 
               snakes; battered by the fierce winds. Two vast forces on a

The Businessman looks at the photo. Scott gestures at Anton,
and passes the photo of Laura Newton to Anton. And then
looks as if to say "In or Out?" Anton hesitates a moment,
and then strikes the Businessman.

                         ANTON
               Did you See This Girl...?

ANGLE on the Businessman, on the ground. Terrified. He looks
back at Scott, as if unable to focus. Scott gives him a beat,
nods, as if to say, "What would you expect", and starts up
the stairs.

INT. WHOREHOUSE. NIGHT.

Scott enters the vaguely Japanese modern establishment.
Several Swat figures are being stood down. They sit, sharing
a thermos of coffee. One of the Swat team nods to Scott, and
motions him to the direction he knows Scott wants to go.

Camera takes Scott past a room where two female Agents are
holding five young women, who are supervised, changing out
of "escort" wear, and into jeans and sweatshirts,
"streetclothes".

ANGLE on Scott, as he enters what is obviously the "office"
of the Bordello. One of the techs is sitting at a bashed-in
computer, he is hooking it up to another laptop. He turns to
Scott.

Beyond them we see Miller. And a very attractive European-
looking woman in her forties. In a room beyond two bodyguard
types are handcuffed, watched over by a Swat officer.

Scott moves back to watch Miller interrogating the woman,
the Madam, who speaks with a middle-European accent.

                         MADAM

Miller waves the rest of the information away. Miller shows
her the photo.

            Have you seen this girl...?

            We see a lot of girls. They apply.
            For the job, as Hostesses...

ANGLE on Scott, who stands by the Tech, who is trying to
reconstruct the broken computer. It prints out a file, on
which we see photos of various faces. Each girl holds a
placard with a number on it.

ANGLE on Anton, who looks down.

ANGLE HIS POV. The wastebasket. In the BG we hear Nadya
going on about the benefits of working as a Hostess. He
motions to Scott.

Scott squats to the ground, and pours out what are revealed
to be several polaroids of beautiful young women. He uses
his knife to rearrange them without touching them. They are
now alighted and we see the numerals twelve, thirteen,
fifteen, on placards which they hold up.

ANGLE on Scott, as he walks back into the interrogation room,
holding the sheet printed out by the computer.

                      NADYA

          Mr. Mann, I've come 1500 miles to see
          you at the risk of losing my home and
          alienating my wife. If I could just
          have a minute. Please.

                         MANN
          Look. I can't tell you the secret of
          life, and I don't have any answers for
          you. I don't give interviews, I am no
          longer a public figure, I just want to
          be left alone. So fuck off.

                         RAY
          Just one minute. I'm begging you.
          Mann looks him over. Then he sighs.

                         MANN
          One minute.
          Mann turns and enters the storefront. Ray follows.

          85 INT. MANN'S STOREFRONT

          It is hardly fashionable, but it's roomy and comfortable.
          There are tables stacked high with mailing envelopes and
          a postage scale. A few workbenches have software and
          spread sheets strewn across them. In the back are a couple
          of personal computers.
          On a side wall there are book jackets and newspaper photos
          in cheap frames: pictures of Mann with Martin Luther
          King...with Bob Dylan...with Timothy Leary...rann being
          arrested at some demonstration.. .Mann at Woodstock...
          Mann's gruff voice pulls Ray's attention away from these
          relics.

                         MANN
          Your minute ain't getting bigger.

                         RAY
          Okay. I understand your desire for
          privacy, and i wouldn't dream of
          intruding if this weren't extremely
          important.

                         MANN
          Oh God. I don't do causes anymore.

          Murph hands his dad a defibrillator he's modified for the
          purpose. He attaches the shock pads to the sides of the
          probe and turns on the power.
                         
          Numbers flash across the screen. Cooper hits a button on
          the controls and it PULSES.

          Cooper unplugs a monitor from his computer and plugs it into
          the defibrillator. After a moment, an image fills the screen:
                         
          An ICE-COVERED PLANET nestled in the center of a system
          impossibly dense with stars. Murph stares, transfixed.
                         
                          MURPH
           Where is that, dad?

          Cooper backs up to his plane. Tars follows him.
                         
          Suddenly, in the plane, the probe emits a high-pitch SQUEAL.
          Tars responds instantly, striding past Cooper to the plane.
          He sees the probe. Tries to open the door. It's locked.

           Now I know why we weren't able to
           hit the relay. It's not interference --
           the blue-shift from the black hole

     Salander eats some toothpaste in Bjurman's private
     bathroom. When she returns to the office, she finds him
     calmly writing a check.

               telling anyone about our date. Enjoy
               your computer games.
     She takes the check and leaves.

                 The carpentry shop is gone. I don't
                 know if he worked there or not. If he
                 did, maybe he used to buy hardware
                 here.

                               CLERK 2
                 I don't recognize him.      Sorry.

                 I had to start somewhere.      Thanks.
       As he gathers up the photos to leave -

                 I'm no detective, but I think I
                 would've started at the retirement
                 home.
       Blomkvist looks up.    Not a bad idea.

178A   INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - STOCKHOLM - DAY              178A
       Salander checks a `mirror' of Bjurman's computer on her
       laptop. Skims one of the monthly reports she instructed
       him to write.

       A group of elderly men and women in a rec room pass
       Blomkvist's photos around. One old man offers -
                               FORSMAN
                 This is Brannlund's kid.       He was a

                Wasp.

      Blomkvist starts to offer his hand before realizing no
      one else has or will.

                               BLOMKVIST
                ... Mikael.

      Trinity sits. None of these people have much experience
      with human interaction. They all look at Blomkvist, but
      he isn't sure why.

                               SALANDER
                The money.

      Blomkvist takes an envelope from his jacket, hands it to
      Trinity. He begins counting it -
242   EXT. LONDON - NIGHT                                       242
      Alone in the back of a parked van amidst electronic
      components he doesn't understand, Blomkvist anxiously
      stares out a tinted window at a dark row house.

      Headlights flare down the street. An approaching car.
      He hopes it passes, but it instead pulls up to the garage
      - waits for the door to go up - pulls in.

                               BLOMKVIST
                Fuck me.
      He watches Anita Vanger get out of the car - the garage
      door come down - light go on inside the house - then dark
      figures hurrying along the side of the house: Trinity,
      Salander, and finally Plague. They climb into the van
      with their tools, firewires, a laptop. None speaks as
      they tether cables to computers in the van. Blomkvist
      just watches. Finally, to him -

                              SALANDER
                It's your turn.
                                                                141.

                                  SALANDER
                  How'd it go?

                  Okay.   I think.

       He sits and watches them monitor the phone and computer
       taps they installed earlier. One of the laptops, without
       anyone touching it, blinks on to a Google screen.

                                  TRINITY
                  She's on.

       A screen name and password characters on a Gmail page
       type themselves. They expect her to go to "Compose," but
       she opens one of the messages - spam - deletes it - marks
       a couple more and banishes them as well.

       The only new thing left in the inbox is an eBay alert.
       Clicking it takes her to an auction for a triple-strand
       faux-pearl Jackie O necklace: 49 pounds. The cursor
       clicks the Buy-It-Now button.

       As the screen switches to Anita's Paypal account,

       Blomkvist emerges from the bathroom, rests a hand on
       Salander's shoulder to peer over it at the screen: In
       one of the windows, cards are dealing themselves.

          I'm pushing because it'll be a crime if the
          world doesn't hear that you wrote a genius

          Richard stares at the printer as a sheet of paper comes out.   A

          Just this. Don't kick their asses
          after they're on it. Half of them,
          especially the girls, didn't know they

          the pushers dissolve some reds in a

     The door opens and DR. JIM PAULSEN appears.  He's a classic
     scientist: unruly hair, thick glasses.  Nothing like Erin has
     ever shown up at his door.  He reels at the sight of her.

                         Long story. Not that interesting.

               She smiles charmingly to cover whatever she's feeling. The 
               more enigmatic she is, the more intrigued he is.

               EXT. BLDG. 20 QUAD - DAY

               Milo and Lisa walk, eat ice cream out of paper cups with 
               Outpost logos. They laugh. We go nearer.

                         So, when you were talking about 
                         wishing people were more like 
                         computers. Was that then? Or now?

                              (when he looks at her)
                         But not right now.

               She maintains eye contact. Her meaning is clear.

               Milo turns, sees Brian (Stanford classmate, Outpost zealot) 
               give an envelope to a Guard at the door of #20; he trots 
               over to Milo, who is as flustered as another guy might be 
               having been found in bed with a girl.

                                     BRIAN
                         Just dropped off a resume. Almost 
                         got in the front door.

               He looks at Lisa, back to Milo, wondering why he isn't being 
               introduced.

               Teddy's brother, NELSON, shows Milo the workspace: red 
               Stanford pennant, rubber trees on the desk. Milo, in a suit, 
               peers at the painted-over epithet on the wall.

                         It's an airtight case. They found 
                         the weapon with Teddy's blood on it 
                         and their fingerprints. They'd been 
                         arrested twice for beating-up Asians. 
                         How come they weren't in jail?

Kaufman pulls a bunch of orchid books off the shelf, carries
them to the register, along with a book on Hegel, which
features an engraving of the philosopher on the cover.
Kaufman waits in line and watches the tattooed female cashier
flirting with the handsome guy ahead of him. He studies
their interaction, the way she looks at him. Her eyes, her
lips. The guy leaves and the cashier waves Kaufman over. As
she rings him up, she expresses no interest in him. He's
hurt and fixates on a sexy flower tattoo on her arm. She
catches him, pulls down her sleeve.

           Smith was cooking the books for the IRS.
           That means he has it all:  The cash flow,
           where it comes from, how we launder it,
           our split with the East.

           Here's the deal--Walter Smith has two
           computer disks like this in his house.
           They're labeled 'Marlon' and 'Al.'

everything that Smith said earlier now makes a horrible

Howell considers the disk.  If Talley has the second disk in

sure --

                     HOWELL
           I have to see if it's real.

Howell brings the disk to a lap top computer set up in the 
corner.  He inserts the disk, and waits for it to read.  He's
satisfied with what he sees --

seconds away.  Marion Clewes is driving; Jane and Amanda are
wedged into the front seat beside him, Jane next to Marion,

1    INT. RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - DAY                  1
     Close on the brilliant colors of a middle eastern rug, the
     center of what seems to be a makeshift "meditation" space.

     We slowly tilt up to discover the back of Riggan Thomson (55).
     He is in the proper `Lotus' position, dressed only in tight
     white briefs and he appears to be meditating deeply. And if all
     this seems a little odd, it becomes all the more so when you
     notice that he is levitating almost two feet above the floor.
     His breath is calm and measured... in and out... in and out.

               This place is a fucking dump.

     We begin to slowly move toward Riggan's back while his measure
     breathing continues. We see a clock on the wall, ticking.

                         MAN (V.O.)
               Smells like balls.

               We don't belong in this shithole.

     A Skype call shatters the silence. Close on his back, we follow
     Riggan as he walks over to the computer and answers the call.
     On the computer screen appears Sam (21), in a pair of Levi's
     and a Led Zeppelin T-shirt. She has simple and striking good
     looks, with an edge in her voice and behind her eyes. She
     stands in a Korean Deli among the flowers, talking to Riggan

               expensively dressed in designer clothes. She gives JACK 
               ten �50 notes.

                                     JANI
                         In 20s, please...

               He slots the cash into the "bank" beneath the table, then 
               counts out �500 in �20 chips. He slides the chips towards 
               her, looks at her. She smiles.

               There are ten other PEOPLE at the roulette table. An ARABIC-
               LOOKING MAN with a moustache behind JANI is looking down 
               the front of her dress.

                                     JACK
                              (frowns)
                         Place your bets.

               Around the table the PUNTERS move their chips onto numbers, 
               lines, colours. JANI throws three chips to JACK and calls 
               the numbers:

Al-Ghazi takes the camera from Fleury. He lines up the same     
shots we saw posted on Leavitt's computer: clearly a match.     
This is where they shot the video

          He was here...                                        

Another long moment. Al-Ghazi looks at the table, discarded
trash: the Capri Sun containers, the candy wrappers.

          everything he could hit.
              (beat)
          Way too pretty a' plan to have been
          fully hatched on just one visit. He
          came here a couple times.

Al-Ghazi quiet for a long while. Then he reciprocates:          

                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI                            
          The man who did this is a Saudi -

          foreigners were up here, someone

Fleury looks over to the two dozen LOCALS peering out with
suspicion at them on the rooftop.

                At one time, Talal was Arafat's
                senior bomb-maker and planner in
                the occupied territories. He joined
                Bin-Laden when Al Qaeda brought the

                He turned himself in last year
                during an amnesty. He's now part of

                the experience of Saudi Youth.

                Why did he turn himself in?

      Before Al-Ghazi can answer, Talal begins talking to him in
      Arabic. Al-Ghazi translates:

                          COLONEL AL-GHAZI

          17 days without sleep will make you

Two TEENAGERS stick their heads into the office. They're mad
about the sharing of a computer. Talal puts a fast stop to
it. It's obvious he's good with these young boys. He smiles
as he speaks to Al-Ghazi.

Al-Ghazi translates to Fleury.

               Molly, in a short terrycloth robe, is sitting in a chair. A 
               magazine is on her lap but she is staring vacantly into the 
               loft. She seems lost in the vast space. Sam is pacing back 
               and forth. There is a melancholy look in his eyes.

                         you.

               Suddenly the BELL rings. Molly jumps.

               Molly's finger is on the intercom. She seems unsettled.

                         Molly, it's Carl. Can I come up?

               Sam freezes. Molly is surprised. She hesitates a moment and 
               then pushes the buzzer to let him in. We hear Carl bounding 
               up the stairs.

                      I'd rather sell my nuts to a castrati.

            Sam screws his face down - huh?

                                GEORGE (CONT'D)

                                SAM
                      You can't promise me anything!  You don't
                      have anything to promise!  You live in a

                      not hooked up to the internet because you
                      don't even own a computer!  You don't

            How else would you test a chess

                      CALEB
            It depends what you're testing it
            for. You can play it to find out
            if it makes good moves. But it
            won't tell you if it knows it's
            playing chess. Or if it even knows
            what chess is.

NATHAN starts adding weights to curl dumbbells.

                      NATHAN

            Exactly. And I think being able to
            differentiate between those two is
            the Turing test you want me to
            perform. The difference between an

     CUT FROM CALEB'S face, to REVEAL the scene.

     CALEB sitting on the sofa by the fireplace.

     NATHAN lying on the floor.
     Out cold.

     After a couple of moments, CALEB stands.

     Then he walks over to NATHAN, and kneels beside him.

     Then puts his hand into NATHAN'S pocket.

     And pulls out his keycard.

     monitors.

     He inserts the KEYCARD into its access slot.

     The dead monitors immediately come to life.

     Most of the screens show the CCTV live feeds from around the

                  Yeah. But he doesn't get an audio
                  feed. I didn't want you two
                  communicating outside of my line of

       Nothing betrays that AVA is anything other than a pretty girl
       in her early twenties.

      Looking at the PILOT.

      The image echoes the POV views from the computer/cell-phone
      cameras in the opening moments of the film.

      Facial recognition vectors flutter around the PILOT'S face.

      And when he opens his mouth to speak, we don't hear words.

      We hear pulses of monotone noise.   Low pitch.   Speech as pure
      pattern recognition.

      This is how AVA sees us.   And hears us.

      It feels completely alien.

      helicopter and opens the passenger door, to allow AVA to
      enter.

      Then he goes back to the PILOT'S door.

      Gets in.

     A beautiful day-

     BRANDON's face now fresh, passing-

     A CUTE NEIGHBOR heading into the building, lost in
     conversation on her cellphone-

                            CUTE NEIGHBOR

     BRANDON juggling cellphone, keys and satchel, heading off to
     work, watching the sway of her ass.

     BRANDON hurries into the office area, unbuckling his coat as
     he does so. DAVID, phone pressed to his ear, mid way through
     a conference call clocks him, throws some lewd gesture.

     BRANDON smiles, throws up his hands, he's late. What can you
     do...

                         BRANDON
               Sorry. Sorry.

     BRANDON continues into his office.

               Fuck, my computer.

     BRANDON puts down his coffee, and takes off his scarf.

               Well, well, well.

                         BRANDON
               Morning, asshole.

               Look who's decided to grace us with
               his presence.

     BRANDON puts his scarf in the closet and takes off his coat.

          The Praetor's power has always been
          the Romulan fleet.  They must be
          behind him.

Picard considers this.

                     PICARD
               (to Data)
          What have you learned about

The images end.  There are no images of Shinzon.

          Starfleet intelligence was only
          able to provide a partial account
          of his military record.  We can
          infer he is relatively young and a
          capable commander.  He fought
          seventeen major engagements in the
          war.  All successful.  Beyond that,
          we know nothing.

                     PICARD
          Well... it seems we're truly
          sailing into the unknown.  Keep at
          it.  Anything you can give me would
          be appreciated.  Dismissed.

The meeting breaks up.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING LAB - DAY

The B-9 stares placidly forward.

We pull back and discover that computer conduits connect the
B-9's head to Data's head.  Geordi monitors the connection.

                     DATA
          At present he serves no useful
          function.  Dr. Soong created us to
          become active and useful members of
          society.  I do not believe he would
          have wanted the B-9 to live out his
          life in his present state.

                     GEORDI
          I can't believe the Captain went
          along with a memory download.

                     DATA
          Captain Picard agrees that the B-9
          was probably designed with the same
          self-actualization parameters as
          myself.  If my memory engrams are
          successfully integrated into his
          positronic matrix, he should have
          all my abilities.

                     GEORDI
          He'd have all your memories too.
          You feel comfortable with that?

          I feel nothing, Geordi.  It is my
          belief that with my memory engrams
          he will be able to function as a
          more complete individual.

                     GEORDI
          An individual more like you, you
          mean.

                     DATA
          Yes.

                     GEORDI
          Maybe he's not supposed to be like
          you.  Maybe he's supposed to be
          just like he is.

Geordi completes his work

                     GEORDI
          Okay... we're done.

Geordi removes the computer connections from between their
heads.  He carefully closes the panel in Data's head as:

                     DATA
               (to B-9)
          Do you know where you are?

                     B-9
          I am in a room with lights.

He looks blankly at the console lights.

                     DATA
          Can you remember our father?

                     B-9
          No.

Data glances to Geordi.

Suran and the others go.

Donatra turns just as she is leaving the chamber, she sees
the Viceroy going to Shinzon.  And then do something odd.
The Viceroy puts his hand on Shinzon's chest, leans very
close and talks to him quietly.  This is an ancient form of
Reman telepathic medical diagnosis.

This strange sight perplexes Donatra.  The doors close,
blocking her view...

INT.  SENATE - CORRIDOR - FOLLOWING

We go with Donatra and the other Romulans.  Donatra speaks
quietly to Suran:

                     DONATRA
          How long before he has us in the
          dilithium mines?

INT.  ENTERPRISE - DATA'S CABIN - DAY

The B-9 sits placidly in a chair, staring forward.

Then, as if a switch was thrown, he moves.  He quickly rises
and goes to a computer console.  He efficiently starts
punching in commands at an amazing velocity.

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - NIGHT

Picard and Shinzon sit alone in a corner of the sweeping
Senate chamber.  The remains of dinner before them.

                     SHINZON
          And when I was ready they were
          going to replace you with me, an
          exact biological duplicate.  Put a
          Romulan agent at the heart of
          Starfleet to influence your command
          structure.  It was a bold plan.

                     PICARD
          What happened?

                     SHINZON
          As happens so frequently here on
          Romulus, a new government came to
          power.  They decided to abandon the
          plan -- frankly, I think they were
          afraid I'd be discovered and it
          would lead to war.  They weren't
          ready for that.

Picard pours a glass of Romulan ale.

INT.  ENTERPRISE  BRIDGE - NIGHT

Picard emerges from the turbolift.  Data, Worf and Geordi
wait at the bridge engineering station.

                     WORF
          Sir, we've had an unauthorized
          access into the main computer.

          Who was it?

                     GEORDI
          It's going to take some time to
          find out -- the data stream was
          rerouted through substations all
          over the ship.

                     PICARD
          What programs were accessed?

          That's what I don't get -- it's
          mostly basic stellar cartography:
          star charts; communications
          protocols; some uplinks from colony
          tracking stations.  It's not even
          restricted material.

He rises, goes to a window, gazes at the Scimitar in the
distance.  A beat.

                     PICARD
          I so wanted to believe Shinzon.
          But the Thalaron radiation can't be
          explained away.  Whatever he's
          after, it's not peace.

                     BEVERLY
          Is he very much like you were?

                     PICARD
          Yes.

          an opportunity to gain a tactical
          advantage.

          I wish I could believe that,
          Doctor.

He goes.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - TURBOLIFT - MORNING

Deanna is alone on the turbolift.  Then a voice makes her
spin:

Title: Star Trek: Nemesis

          It's accelerating.  You have no
          more time for games.

                     SHINZON
          Have the doctors prepare.  I'll be
          on the bridge.

He goes.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - DAY

Shinzon stands with some REMAN ENGINEERS.

                     SHINZON
          Transport.

An Engineer activates a transporter and the B-9 materializes!

                     SHINZON
          Welcome home.
               (to Engineers)
          Begin the download.

Reman engineers go to the B-9 and open the panel in his neck,
begin connecting computer conduits to the extra memory port
we saw earlier.

(Note: Although the audience will not know it yet, this is
actually Data pretending to be the B-9.)

Shinzon goes to a replicator unit and orders:

                     SHINZON
          Tea, hot.

A cup of tea appears.  He takes it and sips as he watches his
Engineers connecting the conduits to the B-9.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY - DAY

Beverly is scanning Deanna.  Picard and Riker watch,
concerned.

          Aside from slightly elevated
          adrenalin and serotonin levels,

               (gently)
          Can you describe it, Deanna?

She looks at Picard, tears in her eyes.

          How long is that?

A beat.  Data gazes at the B-9 deeply.

                     DATA
          A long time, brother.

Data reaches forward and deactivates his brother.

The B-9's eyes lose the spark of life.  He stands, frozen.
Data stands before him.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - NIGHT

Picard is gathered with his senior officers.

A computer display illustrates Geordi's words about the power
of Shinzon's weapon.  We see a chilling graphic of the
Biogenic Pulse beam spreading around a ship, then a whole
planet.

                     GEORDI
          It's called a Cascading Biogenic
          Pulse.  The unique properties of
          Thalaron radiation allow the energy
          beam to expand almost without
          limits.  Depending on the radiant
          intensity it could encompass a
          ship... or a planet.

                     PICARD
               (thinking)
          And that's exactly what he's going
          to do.

                     RIKER
          Sir?

                     PICARD
          His hatred of the Federation is
          apparent.  He would have built a
          weapon of that scope for one
          reason.  He is going after Earth.

Riker uses every ounce of strength he has left -- pushes the
Viceroy off him --

The Viceroy falls down the long tunnel -- to his death.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The whole Enterprise bridge QUAKES as the Scimitar continues
to pull itself free --

Picard stands, steadying himself on his command chair.

                     PICARD
          Data, I need you.

Data joins Picard as:

                     PICARD
          Computer.  Auto-destruct sequence
          Omega.  Zero time delay.  Recognize

                     COMPUTER (V.O.)
          Auto-destruct is off-line.

Then the ship gives a final LURCH.  The Scimitar is free.

An eerie moment of silence after the explosive tearing and
grinding.

Picard watches through the gaping hole in the hull as the
Scimitar backs away.  Another section of the Scimitar
disappears.  Shinzon almost has his cloak back.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon stares at the Enterprise.

A wave of sickness overcomes him for a moment, he doubles
over.  We actually see more veins appearing on his face.
Time is running out.

                     SHINZON
          Target disruptors.  Destroy them.

                     REMAN OFFICER
          Disruptors are off-line, sir.

A beat.  Shinzon looks up.

                     SHINZON
          Deploy the weapon.  Kill everything
          on that ship.  Then set a course
          for Earth.

Sharon is in the report room, using the computer,

The CONTINUING TRUMPET RIFFS are the motor for this. She
suddenly stops as we FOCUS ON the name: "LAMBERT." Then
we watch her as she punches up the data and she reads.

We PAN to find her curled in a chair, staring deeply,
sadly, drinking a drink. As we PAN, we DISCOVER she is
looking at that mural of the mountains and through this
to her thoughts, and then she makes a decision and rises
and goes to the phone, punches in a number.

way, keeping his demons away. When the RING of the PHONE

          DEAN TAINOT is a self-published author and blogger -- with a
          taste for this kind of stuff. Multiple copies of his own
          books line the shelves.
          When he hears the FRONT DOOR open -- he panics.

                         

                          DEAN TAINOT
           Well, hey! Who's home early!
          He keeps clicking away with the mouse until he's safe.
          Mercedes calls from the other room.

          He covers his digital tracks and hops out of his desk.

           That can't happen, Larry.
           I'm extended. I've put a deposit
           down on the first vacation I've had
           in 5 1/2 years. My expenses are as
           valid as yours, so I need the

          He goes back to the computer, to eBay to see how his LP

          One record is going for... $0.75. Another: $1.25. Another:

          He will not forget that kiss or this night. He drives off.

          A TAXI is pulling up. Out of the back, Dean, looking like he

           86.

                         

                         
          He pays the cabbie, pissed off about everything. Then his

          P.O.V.

                         
          All his possessions, stacked up in front of the door. On the

          She smiles -- a rare thing on a morning like this but the
          memory of last night warrants it. She heads in that

          BOOKS on Shakespeare and Shaw go on shelves where Dean's
          tomes used to rest. Computer wires are not even untangled,

          He can see his NEIGHBORS through the open windows -- KIDS
          bouncing on a couch...A QUARTET OF OLD FOLKS playing cards

           Australia for three minutes and
           mentioned kangaroos only twice. And
           Larry Crowne...
          Larry is listening to Dibiasi, wearing what was once his
          UniMart polo, with his nametag and everything. Compared to

           fast. How he connected the Circle
           of Sales to the expanding universe
           is impressive as hell. I'll never
           forget about the Value Index now.
           He gave a perfect speech.

          beside numerous papers, charts, and Will's computer.
          He looks exhausted, gulps from a cup of coffee as he works.

          MAYA O.S.
          My guess is that he lives close to
          where he's making the calls, and it
          makes sense he'd be living in
          Rawalpindi because there's an Al

          It would be convenient for him to
          drop tapes off if he's sending either
          from bin Laden or from an
          intermediary. When he wants to make
          a call, he leaves the house, walks a
          few blocks, then switches on the

                  You chose A- Amitabh Bacchan.
                  Guess what? You just won one
                  thousand rupees!

     Applause on screen. The Inspector looks at Jamal. Jamal
     shrugs.

                                JAMAL
                  You don't have to be a genius.

     Right next to the railway lines is a pond of dirty
     water surrounded by shacks in which dozens of women are
     washing clothes. Trains flash past only feet away from
     them. Down the other end of the pond, nine-year old
     Jamal and Salim are splashing noisily with some other
     children. Jamal's mother pauses in her scrubbing, wipes
     sweat from her forehead and gazes up at the leaden sky.

     Jamal is studying a piece of paper and reading out
     numbers from it. There is something not quite right
     about Jamal- perhaps the fact that there are two feet

     spraying the numbers on a wall with an aerosol and a
     certain lack of confidence.

                              JAMAL
                I don't think that's a good
                idea. He is a very important
                man, Mrs Mackintosh-

                              WOMAN V/O
                - get me the supervisor on this
                line now-

                              JAMAL
                - and he doesn't like bloody
                time wasters.

      Jamal panics, presses the button he saw the Manager
      press earlier. The screen goes blank, then reboots
      itself. Jamal looks around. Where the hell is Dave? On
      the screen, Jamal is faced with the question: "what
      name do you require?" He looks around again, and then
      with one finger types in the word "Latika". He presses
      enter. Hundred upon hundred of Latikas with their
      surnames and phone numbers scroll down the page. He
      erases her name and enters the name Salim K. Malik.
      Presses enter. Fifteen numbers come up. He stares at
      the numbers for a long time, then types it into his
      computer and presses dial.

                                MAN V/O
                Yeah?

                                JAMAL
                Salim?

                              MAN V/O
                Who wants to know? Do you know
                what bloody time it is?

      Clearly not Jamal's brother. Jamal cuts the line. Dials
      the next number.

                   tonight is Jamal Malik- as if we
                   don't know! In an amazing run,
                   Jamal has already five million
                   rupees but, not content with
                   that, has chosen to gamble for
                   one Crore- that's ten million
                   million rupees. What a player!
                   The question one more time:
                   Which cricketer has scored the
                   most first class centuries in
                   history. Was it A) Sachin

                   I know it isn't Sachin
                   Tendulkar.

                                 PREM
                   That's a start. So, it could be
                   Ricky Ponting, Jack Hobbs or
                   Michael Slater.

                                 JAMAL

                Sachin Tendulkar. The computer
                has taken away A) Sachin
                Tendulkar and C) Michael Slater.
                That leaves you a fifty-fifty
                choice, Jamal. B) Ricky Ponting
                or D) Jack Hobbs. What do you

                 Crore rupees, a cool ten
                 million. Tonight, he can walk
                 away with that in his pocket or
                 make the biggest gamble in
                 television history and go for

      ADAs are parking their cars along the wall, directed by a
      waving GUARD. ANGLE FINDS a lot of people: cop, prison, FBI.    *
      Sarah jumps out of her car and hurries over to Nick and the
      others with a flock of EIGHT ADAs at her heels.

      computers, or sorting heaps of paper files, etc.

                   See if there's anybody locked up
                   here -- or working here -- ex-cop,
                   witness for the prosecution --
                   anybody who might have had anything
                   to do with the original Darby-Ames

      the door shut with her hip, gives him a laser look:

          EXT. HARBOR LATER

          The sun is fast climbing into the morning sky as "GIGI"
          glides out of the channel and past a LIGHTHOUSE that sits
          Just off the point of a good sized ISLAND.
          Jason shields his eyes with his hand. He gazes out at the
          island. Matt comes up beside him and sticks a baseball cap
          onto his head. The crown reads U.S.S. CONSTELLATION.

                         JASON
          Thank you.

                         MATT
          Ever been over there?

                         JASON
          No sir.

                         MATT
          It's beautiful. Isn't an island anymore
          though. It's a city. They have electric
          lights. Artesian wells, even a jail
          lighthouse isn't manned anymore - it's
          run by a computer When I lived there,
          had no ferry then` so we didn't even have
          cars, can you believe that?

                         JASON
          How'd you get back?

                         MATT
          Off the island?
          Jason nods.
          We rowed.
          Matt smiles at the memory.

          Then we got a little outboard. That was
          great. A seven and a half horsepower it
          was - we lived there until I was about
          your age - then we left and became
          "harbor people".
          Jason seems to be digesting this.

          comes to a halt. Riders shuffle around.
          Rebecca sees a seat open up and sits down. She opens her

          TESS has come down to New York with news for her mother.

                         TESS
          So I went to MIT. He was there in
          his computer room and I just pressed
          him and pressed him and pressed him.
          I had this strapped to me.
          TESS puts a small tape recorder on the desk.
          TESS turns it on. OUISA listens to the tape.

          TRENT'S TAPED VOICE
          Yes, I knew Paul.

          INT A COMPUTER ROOM AT MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY
          THE CAMERA focusses in on her thigh. WE can see the slight
          bump where TESS has strapped the recorder.

          TRENT looks up from his bank of computers at TESS.
          TRENT's pinched face looks as if it has never, known one
          truly happy day.

                         TESS A
          But what happened between you?

                         TRENT
          It was...It was...

          EXT A DOORWAY RAIN NIGHT
          PAUL dressed in ragged clothes stands huddled in a doorway
          to get out of the freezing rain.
          TRENT passes by the doorway.
          TRENT is gone.
          Then TRENT reappears and stares at PAUL.

          address book with him. Well, he's already been
          in all your houses. Maybe I will meet him

          He took stuff from you?

          The door leading to outside is three inches thick and

                    Yeah, Garbage, okay, give me Garbage.

        He selects a Garbage file and starts the download. His

        Joey is pushed into a sofa. He sees his computer, "Lucy",
        being carried away.

        Joey dives onto the agent carrying Lucy away, losing his
        towel.  His mother, seeing his exposed buttocks, is
        shocked.

                    Yesterday, the ballast program for a
                    supertanker training model mistakenly thought
                    the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.

                You'll make your picks and record them every day, once a day 
               Monday through Friday and five times a day on weekends.  Each 
               call's worth 25 bucks a shot.  Right now we get a few dozen hits 
               a week.  We should be doing triple that.  I'm sending down some 
               test copy.  Before you record it, a little advice.

               ANGLE ON -- TWO GLASSED-IN OFFICES overlooking the sales room. 
                  One office is crammed with clutter, bears a prominent KEEP 
               OUT sign on the door.  Inside, a big, bearded MAN wolfs a breakfast 
               burrito, scours the sports pages.  In the other office sits a 
               suited, studious-looking MAN in his 30s, talking on a headset--

               JERRY SYKES types stats into a computer as he fields a call. 
                 Three other computer screens flash football info and data. 
                Large, complex wall graphs chart esoteric team trends.  A framed 
               promotional picture shows JERRY standing in a bank vault, the 
               banner type below reading "Jerry 'The Source' Sykes, Creator

               --I know it's a new stadium, I'm asking if they used Astroturf 
               or Astroplay?... Astroplay, it has a rubber silica base, like 
               ground up tires... Look, I don't have time to explain abrasion 
               indexes and resistance scales to you, trust me, it makes a big 
               fucking difference...

          No, no.  It's fine.

Claire slowly leans out over the water to check her
reflection...

                     NORMAN (V.O.)
          You sure?

...but the shape is gone.

                     NORMAN (V.O.)
          Claire?

                     CLAIRE
          Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.

She clicks off the phone and looks down at the calm water.

INT.  WORK ROOM - NIGHT

Claire sits in a small workroom at a computer.  She focuses
intently on the screen.

ANGLE

It's ALICE'S COMPUTER SOLITAIRE.  She flips the last card and
an animated Queen of Hearts, accompanied by a series of
musical notes, parades across the screen.

                     QUEEN OF HEARTS
               (on computer)
          You lost!  Off with your head!

Claire hits "New Game" and watches as a fresh hand of cyber
solitaire is dealt.  She suddenly has a thought and
disappears into the kitchen.

INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

She glances at Jody's tea, smiles, then refills her glass of
red wine.  She picks up the phone from its cradle and moves
into:

INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

She dials a number.  LOUD REGGAE can be heard blaring through
the phone.

          She's in 314...Well, could you check?

She plugs one ear.

          me, how can you study with that?

The noise abruptly stops.  Claire clicks off the phone and
replaces it in the sweater pocket.  She tunes the stereo to a
classical music station.

INT.  WORK ROOM - NIGHT

She walks in, places the cordless phone on a BASE UNIT, then
hears a different set of musical notes from the computer.
She stares at the screen, stunned.

ANGLE

The game has been finished.  Cards with faces swarm
chaotically across the screen with the message:  YOU WIN!

                     CLAIRE
          Oh.  Kay.

Without warning, the radio dial rips cacophonously past
several stations and comes to a stop on some angry, punkish
rock and roll.

                     CLAIRE
          Jesus...

She bolts around a corner to the stereo.  The music is
chaotic and deafening.  She finds Cooper growling at...no
one.  She turns off the stereo.  Cooper suddenly bolts down
the hall.  She follows him.

INT.  FOYER - NIGHT

The foyer's empty, but the front door is open.  Claire
nervously walks out and looks around.

                     ELENA
          She got it.
               (beat)
          Turned it down.

                     CLAIRE
          I met a dashing young grad student after a
          recital one night...

Claire puts her arm around Norman.

                     CLAIRE
          ...and three months later I was married.

He squeezes her hand.

INT.  WORK ROOM - DAY

Claire walks into the work room with the portable phone to
her ear and a cup of Jody's special tea.  She sniffs it and
makes a face as she turns on the computer.  After several
rings a GIRL picks up on the other end.

                     CLAIRE
               (on phone)
          Caitlin?

                     GIRL'S VOICE
               (overlapping)
          Can you hang up?  I'm trying to make a
          call.

The line goes dead.  Claire hits redial and gets...a BUSY
SIGNAL.  She clicks the phone off as the computer boots up.
Claire puts the phone down and starts a game of Alice's
Solitaire.  She turns a card and waits.

                     CLAIRE
          Gee, that's tricky.  Sure could use some
          help.

She waits, the cursor blinks benignly.

                     CLAIRE
          Come on...

Nothing happens.

INT.  NORMAN AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - DAY

She walks into the room and notices STEAM wafting from the
cracked bathroom door.

INT.  BATHROOM - DAY

Claire enters the steamy bathroom.  The tub is nearly
overflowing with water.  She squats down to drain the tub.

She stops, feeling watched, then slowly peers behind her...no
one's there.  Claire reaches toward the water to yank the
plug's chain, then freezes.  In the bathwater's still
reflection she see:

A PRETTY YOUNG BLOND standing beside her.  Startled, she pops
up and slams into the SHOWER HEAD.

Claire collapses over the side of the tub, her head dipping
underwater.  A small cloud of red surrounds her.  Moments
later, an arm wraps around her.
