                    I propose we get your father a job
                    here in Ukiah and you can come and
                    live with him.

                    Brilliant. Not that I'm fond of
                    Ukiah, but I'd live in a drainage
                    culvert to be with you.

                    Progressive Plywood is looking for
                    an assistant editor. It would be
                    perfect for your father.

                         I'm what's known as a three-river 
                         man. Which just means I go around 
                         playing stud poker wherever I can 
                         find the kind of action I'm looking

                         Yeah. I was playing in this game in 
                         the hotel and she was a waitress in 
                         the coffee shop. We went out. I told 
                         her I thought she could get a better

                         Now how did you happen to tell her 
                         that? Maybe you run some kind of 
                         employment service on the side?

                         I said it because I wanted her in 
                         St. Louis. Anyway, she made it there 
                         and she called me and we been seeing

Abruptly Sidney bursts out, giving as good as he has taken:

                         SIDNEY
            No more you don't!  What is this -
            You're showing off for her?  They're
            supposed to hear you in Korea?

                         WELDON
                   (smirking to the girl)
            He's intuitive - he knows he's
            getting fired!

                         SIDNEY
            If you're funny, James, I'm a
            pretzel!  Drop dead!

Weldon, shepherded by the girl, is already on his way across
the sidewalk.

                         WELDON
            It was nice knowing you, Sidney.
            Not cheap - but nice.  Happy
            unemployment insurance.

INT. TWENTY ONE CLUB - NIGHT

Sidney, entering the Club, threads his way through the
crowded foyer, coming up to CAMERA near the foot of the
staircase.  There he meets a Captain who turns to him.

            How are you tonight, Mr. Falco?

            But of course...

           Stipulated in your contract was a

ON STAGE

An actor, CONDELL (40's), dressed all in white (even
his face is painted white) enters stage. He is
"Prologue". He addresses the audience directly.

                        "PROLOGUE"
           Oh, for a muse of fire, that would
           ascend the brightest heaven of
           invention. A kingdom for a stage,
           princes to act, and monarchs to behold
           the swelling scene! Then should
           warlike Harry, like himself, assume
           the port of Mars, and at his heels
           should famine, sword, and fire crouch
           for his employment. Can this cockpit
           hold the vasty fields of France?

Jonson seems surprised.   This is not what he expected.

           It's about a guy named Sam.
          And we go close on Gekko...

           GORDON GEKKO (CONT'D)
           Sam used to work a job, he made things
           and he grew things and he sold those
           things. Until one day Sam got a
           credit card and was amazed how easy it
           was to buy things with it. So Sam got
           another card and then another. Then
           he used the credit card money to make
           it look like he had an income... and
           he used that "income" to secure a
           loan.

	JAKE LAMOTTA, wearing a tux, is shadow-boxing.
	
	We are unsure of where he is -- he moves in and out of the
	shadows. At 42, he's overweight and out of shape, but the
	balls of his feet still pop up and down like they were on
	canvas and his tiny fists still jerk forward with short
	bursts of light. He is rehearsing a nightclub monologue.

	     Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
	     It's a thrill to be standing here
	     talking to you wonderful people. In
	     fact, it's a thrill to be standing!
	     I haven't seen so many people since
	     my last fight at Madison Square
	     Garden. After that fight, a
	     reporter asked me, 'Jake, where do
	     you go from here?' I said, 'To a
	     hospital!' I fought one hundred and
	     six professional fights and still
	     none of them bums figured out how
	     to fight me -- they kept hitting me
	     in the head! And that's why I'm
	     here tonight...

	     seek employment, seek employment.

              Dead?  Yeah, I got that impression.

                                  PAUL
              But you had dropped off the face of the earth.

                                  RAYMOND
              And you just decide to make it permanent?

                                  PAUL
              But there were no records of you anywhere.  I
              checked.

      With that, Raymond kicks his brother hard in the ribs.  Paul doubles over,
      gasping for breath.

                                  RAYMOND
              In certain lines of quasi-legal employment, using
              your actual ID can be a hinderance.  But despite the
              reliance on aliases, it's nice to have your actual birth
              certificate to fall back on.  Gotta tell ya, Paul, I was
              pretty pissed.

      Raymond is about to kick him once more, but Paul puts up a hand, begging
      him to stop.  Raymond, relents, then bends over and helps his brother to a
      sitting position.

                                  RAYMOND (cont'd)
              But then I start to think, Paul's no idiot.  He woulda
              told 'em it's not me.  Unless...

      Paul can only sit there and WHEEZE.  Raymond sits beside him on the floor,
      pulls out a cigarette and lights it.

                                  RAYMOND (cont'd)
              So what is it?  Frame job, lawsuit...

                                  PAUL
              Life insurance.

                                  RAYMOND
              Figured.  So where's my money?

                                  PAUL
              Your money?
                        (a beat)
              They're still... investigating.

                                  RAYMOND
              What you get?

      Paul considers whether or not Raymond would even remember.
