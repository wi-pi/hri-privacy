                         Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like 
                         mindless, boring, getting-to-know-
                         you chit-chat. This sounds like you 
                         actually have something to say.

                         You can't promise something like 
                         that. I have no idea what you're 
                         gonna ask. You could ask me what 
                         you're gonna ask me, and my natural 
                         response could be to be offended. 
                         Then, through no fault of my own, I 
                         woulda broken my promise.

                         That is an impossibility. Trying to 
                         forget anything as intriguing as 
                         this would be an exercise in futility.

               The asbestos mist still clings. Men in protective suits and
               masks move slowly, like moon walkers. Halted traffic,
               abandoned cars. Mud covering the sidewalks and shop windows.

               Stillness. A slow whirling 360-degree shot. The kitchen area
               is empty. The door of the portable toilet is open and no one
               is inside. The makeshift wardrobe is empty except for four or
               five hangers with shirts and jackets. There is no one at the
               desk or exercise bike.
          
               A sound, faint but persistent, like an intake of air.
          
               The bathroom. The toilet bowl has been ripped out and taken
               away, leaving a hole in the floor. Brownish water drips from
               the tap into the wash basin, which is indelibly stained. The
               drip makes a two-part sound and it matches the rhythm of the
               intake of air. One-two. Pause. One-two. The bathtub has been
               sprayed by a graffiti artist. Multi-colored swirls and
               arabesques.
               S
                teven is sitting on a mat in the tub, arms in the air and
               folded so that his fists are close to his ears. He is in
               lotus position, breathing in serious meditation -- a deep
               intake of breath followed by a softer expulsion, matching the
               beat of the dripping faucet.
          
               He is still wearing the sleep mask.

          He returns his attention to the business of locating his
          gun. He scrapes the heel of an extended leg (to his extreme
          discomfort) along the ground hoping to discover it -- and
          does. Seeing it, he now goes through the painful exercise
          of reaching for it -- finally managing this, too. Now,
          lifting one knee as a gun mount, he holds the revolver in
          both hands and starts to take aim.

          exit. Now the Hippie's vision (FOCUS) blurs for a moment,
          and when it clears, Green has already disappeared through
          the door and Brown is right behind him. The gunsight centers
          on Brown's broad back -- and the gun fires. Brown convulses

                    ACTING TEACHER (CONT'D)
          Not to act. The genesis of acting
          is seeing. Yes? That's the first
          thing. The raw material of all
          acting is seeing, observing,
          understanding what makes behavior.
          I would say pay attention! So when
          we start doing the repetition
          exercise, that person does it to
          you; you just react. Whereas a lot
          of actors make it happen. Yes? But
          that's not acting. That's pushing,
          whereas you should just be relaxed.

The kids are listening, intently, taking it in.

          Being able to do two things at once
          is a big part of success. I try
          and do abdominal
          exercises... isometrics... even when
          I'm at a meeting. Tensing.
          Holding. And then releasing. And
          there are leg ones I do in the car.
          I'll even floss in the shower while
          the conditioner is in my hair.

          she's not at the beach.
          
          In fact, she's in an office, sitting on a chair. A NEWLY
          OPEN BAG OF KITTY LITTER sits next to a plastic tub she's
          got her feet in. Two FLOOR LAMPS stand like sentinels

     the maze. Oxford and his fencing master, BEAULIEU
     (20's) are in the center of the maze dueling with
     rapiers for exercise.

     CLOSER

     They wear outfits that are slightly more protective
     than ornamental.

     They duel for a few moments, and then Oxford TOUCHES

     And they once again begin to duel. But we quickly
     surmise something is amiss. Beaulieu is much more

     is an expert swordsman, and defends himself well.

     continues his attack.

     This has become an assassination attempt, not an

     Francesco is entering the maze with a silver tray
     carrying a pitcher and two goblets.

     CENTER OF THE MAZE

     Though wounded, Oxford is a superior swordsman. And he
     begins his own attack-- with a ferocity that surprises
     Beaulieu.

     Francesco heads for the center as--

As we PAN the group, we see that everyone has his/her
eyes closed in earnest meditation... until we COME TO an
American, MAX LOEB, 29, who pops open first his right eye
-- looks to his right and left -- closes his right eye
and opens his left eye -- looks left and right... and
then, instead of continuing the mantra and the search for
his white light, expels a stream of air through his
pursed lips, making a vibrating, flatulent sound, one
indicative of sizeable frustration and dismissal.
                         MAX
         Get serious.
Around him, other single eyes pop open, searching for the
source of this unmeditative sound. Max nods and smiles
a wry smile as if to say: This just ain't doin' it for
me, folks.

clothes and books in a knapsack and a small valise. We
notice the Hebrew letter chai on a gold chain around his

in an Indian style, endeavors to exercise the inner peace
she's been pursuing...
                       BETSY
         I swear to God, you never give
         anything enough time! What did
         you expect in five days, Max?
                          MAX
         Only what    they promise in the
         brochure:     Inner peace, serenity,
         and a nice    chant that gets rid of
         this rock    in my gut. E.S.T., they
         do you in    a weekend.

         I would really appreciate it if
         you wouldn't be terribly glib just
         now, Max.
That's okay with Max, who's willing to eschew communica-
tion of all kinds and just finish heaving his stuff in
the valise.

EXT. COLUMBIA QUAD - DAY

First day of college. Allen crosses the grand Ivy League
campus in awe. Before him, the staggering facade of the
library like the Parthenon. A troop of Navy midshipmen pass
by. Wartime is on.


INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - DAY

Allen sets his bag on his bed. He notices on one wall are
patriotic posters, exercise posters. He's already got a
roommate.

He eyes a map of the New York City subway system. He can't
believe he's really here in the big city. He walks over to
it.

Allen studies the map, his finger gliding down to Greenwich

              You're late.

    A LITTLE LATER

    The center of the iron lung, basically a thin mattress, has
    been slid out, and Joan is in the process of giving Mark a
    bed bath. He is frail and helpless.
                                        4.


    There is a look of resentment in his eyes as this apparently
    unfeeling woman exercises total control over him, at least
    temporarily.

                        MARK (V.O.)
              Joan
              I swear this was one crazy bitch
              Who'd swing me about enough to
              scare me,
              But careful enough so she could
              say:
              "Now what was all the yelling
              about? You polios are screamers.
              Always were."
              I didn't say a word, but typed my
              skinny novel in my head,
              And thought about revenge.

    In the course of washing his private parts, Mark has an
    involuntary erection. Joan gives him a shriveling look. He
    feels belittled and humiliated.
    A LITTLE LATER

    Mark is on his side, his trousers are on and she is buttoning
    up a bright red shirt. It is an awkward business. They do it
    in silence, avoiding eye contact as much as possible.

    Joan pushes Mark along in a gurney, similar, but slightly
    different from the one in the news clip. There are no mirrors
    and no motor, just an oxygen tank, a tube and a mouthpiece
    just next to Mark's mouth. Most of him is covered with a
    colorful blanket. The whole thing is a sports-coupe version
    of his iron lung.

She moves her fingers along his side, very, very lightly. For
Mark, so far, this is the best.

           MARK (CONT'D)
Are these the body awareness

                You're clever to have worked that
                out.

     Her hands massage their way down his torso. Mark's reactions
     are a little like shock waves.

                          MARK
                People tell me I'm very perceptive.

                          CHERYL
                Would you like to see what I feel
                like?

The Guards release Fred into the yard for his exercise.  At 
first the sunlight is blinding, and Fred covers his eyes.  He 
moves along the wall, tentative, his fingers feeling the way.  
Fnally he slumps down on his haunches, back leaned 
against the wall, eyes closed, letting the sun hit his face.  Very 
soon, however, the sun passes behind a cloud and Fred is 
bathed in shade.  Fred stands up, but is almost immediately 
hit by a searing pain in his head.  Fred holds his head with 
his hands, sinks down to his knees.  The Guard, who has been 
observing Fred from the doorway, comes over to him.

	As it is best to nip vice in the

	exercise his authority in such a
	manner as that there may be no
	question about it, I took every
	opportunity of coming to close
	quarters with Master Brookside.

	Dear child, what a pity it is I am

	the James' of Duganstown, would they
	not, Mr. James Cosgrove?

          Images that indicate the passing of time during the shooting. Short
          sequences of the minute work done by each of the teams, as if
          assembling ballet pieces, all of it accompanied by a musical score:
          The D.P. sets up the lighting for the shoot, the bulbs are lit, the
          filters applied, the interior of the camera cleaned, the film is
          loaded. The atmosphere is set. Pina in her bedroom, lying on the
          bed, with one leg in a cast, is relaxing, breathing deeply. The
          actress playing Chon jokes around with the costume team, they laugh.
          But no one pays attention to the others. Edurne, in a close-up,
          retouches one of Pina's eyes. The mouth as well. Chon stops laughing
          so that the hair-stylist may shape her hair.
          All the images are very brief... The score predominates, the ambient
          sounds of the activities of the different teams is heard more like a
          whisper. The scene must not last longer than a minute. This set of
          images serves to abridge time and to indicate that the shooting is in
          its final days, after a long journey.
          There will probably not be many images, but less: the bulb that
          lights, Lena's eye as Edurne retouches it, its blinking, its sadness.
          Chon's mouth as she speaks without pause, stopping only when lipstick
          is added. The film loaded, the hair fluffed. Lena lying on the rug
          in her dressing room, totally motionless, her eyes made-up and closed,
          doing breathing exercises for relaxation, her leg in a cast, etc.
          Motor. Action!

		You feel you've been rehabilitated? 

				RED 
		Yes, sir. Absolutely. I've learned

		changed man. I'm no longer a danger 
		to society. That's the God's honest 
		truth. No doubt about it. 

	The men just stare at him. One stifles a yawn. 

	CLOSEUP -- PAROLE FORM 

	A big rubber stamp slams down: "REJECTED" in red ink. 

10	EXT -- EXERCISE YARD -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- DUSK (1947) 10

	High stone walls topped with snaky concertina wire, set off at
	intervals by looming guard towers. Over a hundred CONS are 
	in the yard. Playing catch, shooting craps, jawing at each 
	other, making deals. Exercise period. 



	RED emerges into fading daylight, slouches low-key through the 
	activity, worn cap on his head, exchanging hellos and doing 
	minor business. He's an important man here. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		There's a con like me in every prison 
		in America, I guess. I'm the guy who 
		can get it for you. Cigarettes, a 
		bag of reefer if you're partial, a 
		bottle of brandy to celebrate your 
		kid's high school graduation. Damn 
		near anything, within reason. 

	He slips somebody a pack of smokes, smooth sleight-of-hand.

				RED (V.O.) 
		Yes sir, I'm a regular Sears &amp; 
		Roebuck. 

	TWO SHORT SIREN BLASTS issue from the main tower, drawing 
	everybody's attention to the loading dock. The outer gate 
	swings open...revealing a gray prison bus outside.

	Red is joined by HEYWOOD, SKEET, FLOYD, JIGGER, ERNIE, SNOOZE.

	Bogs looms from the billowing steam, smiling, checking Andy up
	and down. Rooster and PETE appear from the sides. The Sisters.

	Andy tries to step past them. He gets shoved around, nothing
	serious, just some slap and tickle. Jackals sizing up prey.

	quartz. It's a beautifully-crafted chess piece in the shape of 
	a horse's head, poise and nobility captured in gleaming stone. 

	He puts the knight on a chess board by his bed, adding it to 
	four pieces already there: a king, a queen, and two bishops. 
	He turns to Rita. Moonlight casts bars across her face.

		I don't like it here. I'm tired of

	He takes one last look around. Only one thing left to do. He 
	steps to a wooden chair in the center of the room, pulls out s 
	pocketknife, and glances up at the ceiling beam. 

	He steps up onto the chair. It wobbles queasily. Now facing
	the beam, he carves a message into the wood: "Brooks Hatlen
	was here." He smiles with a sort of inner peace.

	Andy is sorting books on the cart. He replaces a stack on the

	a chair over and stands on it, peers cautiously over.

          The official term for it is

          us, I'd canceled all off base
          exercises save one - a six man cadet
          team and their Drill out in the bush.
          We're missing three and the Sergeant.
          The cadets are in their eighth week
          of the cycle, nobody here knows much
          about them, up to and including their
          names. But the Sergeant...

          Sergeant West's served for twenty-

          of the modern Army.

          The exercise was one of his Section

          2100 yesterday and were scheduled
          for pick up at 0630 this morning.

          And the problem is you only got three.
                      STYLES
          No, the problem is one's dead, one's
          got a bullet in his arm, and one
          won't talk. The one who won't talk
          was trading live fire with the dead
          one as we reached the pick-up.
