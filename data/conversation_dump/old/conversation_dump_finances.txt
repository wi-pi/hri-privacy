                         It looks like a bill from Jiffy-Lube.

               Vanessa takes the note from his hand and turns it over, 
               examining it.

                                     VANESSA
                         It's for me.

               EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - NIGHT

               Juno parks her car and walks up to her house. A porch light's 
               been left on for her, and the place looks cozy and inviting.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         I never realize how much I like being 
                         home unless I've been somewhere really 
                         different for a while.

               She picks a CROCUS from the unkempt garden near the porch 
               and sniffs it. She lifts her shirt and tickles her belly 
               with it. Then she tucks the flower into her unkempt hair.

               INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Mac is alone at the kitchen table going over the family 
               finances while drinking one of Bren's weight loss shakes.

               Juno enters.

                         Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. 
                         Where have you been?

                                     JUNO
                         Dealing with stuff way beyond my 
                         maturity level. Where is everyone?

                         Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot

			Jesus!  Just my luck!

	He takes off his hat, wiping his forehead with a silk
	cloth.

					PINZON
			Listen.  I'll do the talking for
			both of us.  You just nod.  Agreed?
			Just as I do with the wife.

	COLUMBUS nods.

					PINZON
			I know that the Commission turned
			you down, right?  What do you
			expect?  You're a foreigner... But I
			want to help you.

	COLUMBUS gives him a glance like one throws a question in
	the air.

					PINZON
			You wonder why I believe in you?
			Hey, I am a seaman.  And we don't
			like to be told where to go, and
			where not to go.

	COLUMBUS looks at him, and bursts out laughing.  The other
	MONK looks round severely.  COLUMBUS ducks behind a map,
	PINZON following him.  PINZON lowers his voice.

					PINZON
			I don't look like it, but I have
			friends at the Court.  The Treasurer
			of Aragon, for example.  He finances
			me.  His name's Santangel.  Ever
			heard of him?

	COLUMBUS shakes his head, but looks increasingly
	interested by what he's hearing.

					PINZON
			He can get you an audience with the
			Queen!  You know why...?  She owes
			him money.  That's how it is.  You
			-- me -- the Queen -- the world and
			his mistress -- agreed?

	COLUMBUS nods.

					PINZON
			So.  What do you say?

	COLUMBUS looks around, catches the disapproving face of
	the MONK, crosses himself, then speaks:

					COLUMBUS
			Where can I meet this man?

					PINZON
				(indicating with a
				nod)
			Immediately.

	COLUMBUS turns and sees an elegant Lord in his fifties,
	examining the maps.

          Never.

          Do you think that ring in your eyelid
          makes you attractive?

Salander, who's had to suffer insufferable officials all
her life, doesn't dignify the question with an answer.
                        BJURMAN
          Here's the problem. There a
          discrepancy between the obligation of
          Mr. Palmgren's guardianship and the
          management of your finances.

                        SALANDER
          It isn't a discrepancy or a problem.
          It was clear to him I could manage my
          own finances.
                        BJURMAN
          But that's not clear to me.
                        SALANDER
          I'm not a child.

                         BJURMAN
          No.  You're not.
                (looks at her too long)
          But you were. And between then and
          now -
                (indicating the files)
          - two years in the locked ward at
          St. Stephens, for violent aggression -
          failure to adapt to four foster homes
          and seven schools - arrested twice
          for intoxication, twice for narcotics
          use, and most recently for assault:
          a bottle smashed into a man's face.
          You may have conned Mr. Palmgren into
          thinking you've improved, but looking
          at this -
                (the file)
          - not to mention how you're looking
          at me now - I can see you haven't.
          So the Good-Old-Mr-Palmgren-Days are
          over. Starting now, you'll be given
          a monthly allowance. You'll provide
          me with receipts for your expenses.

               You do not! She is only managing
               the dictates of the household
                         DIDO
               Papaa...how...how may I be too high
               in rank to dine with the servants
               and too low to dine with my family?

                         LORD MANSFIELD
               Dinner with guests is a formal
               proceeding, Dido - we simply
               cannot impose the disregard of
               those formalities upon visitors.
                         DIDO
               But...Papaa, am I not..'wealthy',
               now...an heiress? Surely that
               changes matters...
                         LORD MANSFIELD
                   (softly)
               My dear...I wish it were so
               simple. Finances may go some way -
               but Society has a habit of
               disregarding even one of their
               own, when opportunity provides.

               Of course...(trailing off)
                         LORD MANSFIELD
               BUT after dinner...when formality
               is of less consequence...well
               your presence can raise no
               defendable objections.

          I am no member of the nobility -
          I have little, but...where my
          father relies on the bible, I...I
          wish to rely on the law courts.
                    LORD MANSFIELD
          You aspire to the judiciary?

LORD MANSFIELD laughs at him. DIDO stares at the ground -
cringing on JOHN'S behalf. John asserts himself.
                    JOHN
          One day...yes...m'lord. I wish to
          make the laws not only administer
          them - for that...that is how I may
          truly change this world. I mean to
          say, make it... a better place.

     A beat. His words force DIDO to look up, affected.

                         LORD MANSFIELD
               Noble if not pompous! A country
               lawyer, you may make - perhaps! If
               you pay every regard to what you
               are taught - but you have neither
               the rank nor finances for any more!

                   (tentative)
               If I may, m'lord - neither did you!

                         LORD MANSFIELD
               I beg your pardon?

                         JOHN
               Well...as a fourth son, you had
               rank but not the income to pay for
               your qualification to the Inns.

     DIDO's wide eyes take in JOHN, astonished by his chuzpah.
                         JOHN (CONT'D)
               Without the sponsorship of Lord
               Foley and William Hamilton...the
               English courts may not have
               benefited from your brilliance -

          receive her inheritance?
As DIDO observes her reflection in waters - easy laughter
floats by - a group of gentleman josh.

A figure beside her turns - icy blue stare takes her in as
she meets his gaze and finds herself staring into the eyes
of JAMES ASHFORD.
                    JAMES ASHFORD.
          Miss Lindsay. Not Husband

          share his dining room with you, as
          well as his bed??
His words bury deep and painful.

          Oh, Mr James, your manners are as
          poor as your brother's finances.

She follows his gaze through trees to ELIZABETH breathing
in the scent of the azaleas beside MR VAUGHAN. The joshing
gentlemen trickle away leaving only DIDO and JAMES.
She goes to move off. JAMES grabs her arm, spitefully.
