           You'll lead off next assignment
           with three minutes on a personal

           a laundry list or slide show. And,
           as I told Dibiasi, no one wants to
           hear about the first time you got
           laid.

           feel worse about your behavior, but
           I didn't know anything, I didn't
           know how to handle it. I mean,
           that's what all this Eagles stuff
           is about. It's about us, spending
           time now. I wanna do everything I
           can to help you get back on your
           feet. That's the whole point. Yeah.
           I wish you'd watch these games with
           me so we could talk, we could get
           into things. (inhales) So would

           No, you're not messing up the juju,

the whole character of this page changes with the exception
of Guy's picture, which becomes surrounded with large type,
announcing the arrest of Guy Haines for the murder of his
wife Miriam. A sub-heading tells of Guy's cigarette lighter
found at the scene of the crime. All this DISSOLVES AWAY
and the page becomes once more the sports section.

               Chump change, Brandon.  We're angling for bigger fish here.  
               You see, the networks don't talk about it and Uncle Sam can't 
               tax it, but sports gambling is a 200-billion-dollar-a-year-business. 
                These gamblers have needs, Brandon.  Come Monday morning, after 
               a losing weekend, a lot of them have big needs.

               That's every pro game played last Sunday.

               Do you know why Monday Night's the most watched game of the week? 
                It's because Monday's the last chance bettors have to climb 
               out of the hole before paying their bookies on Tuesday.  Sports 
               betting's illegal in 49 states, including this one, but what 
               we do is 100% legal -- it's exactly the same as a stock broker, 
               only instead of touting stocks, we advise people on how to bet. 
                We make the big money off our client list.  You see, when a 
               client wins with our advice we take a percentage, which they 
               gladly give to keep getting our picks.  When they lose we get 
               zip.  So the object here, my tall, athletic, religious friend 
               -- is to win.

               relaxed,
 
               getting a feel, see how they move.  Then there's a shift, a plan 
               forms and you connect to your teams.
 
               (the GIRL moans, reacting to something unseen)

               Sunday's like penetration and the games have started and teams 
               are scoring and 
 
               you're inside and you're doing it and 

               it's doing you, feeling every shift,

               every score, every trickle of sweat --

               the giving, taking, the long, the short,

               excitement growing bigger and bigger--

               (BRANDON cupping her breasts)

               And it's not an idea or part of you anymore -- it is you, all 
               of you -- and the crowd's roaring and the clock's 
 
               ticking and you know everything except 

               how it'll end and and then you've won -- over and over and over 
               and it's like one, big, huge, insane, weekend-long orgasm.

               Louis upsets K.C., 34-14.  And another Sunday surprise, Philly 
               trounces Pittsburgh, 23-10.
 
               CHRIS BERMAN continues with the scores as -- a PENCIL runs down 
               BRANDON'S betting sheet -- checking off results -- loss --  loss 
               -- loss -- loss -- loss -- the pencil pauses -- suddenly snaps 
               from the pressure of the person's hand and -- WALTER stares at 
               BRANDON, seated on the sofa, watching the tvs.  It's obvious 
               they're getting killed.

               this weekend.  Two winners and two over/unders.  That's all we

               we get the sales people burning up the phones and come Monday

As Commodus speaks he moves to the bust of Marcus, studies

whisked away.  Lucilla watches this closely.

		I doubt many of the people have such

		Not just any games, Senator!  A

Maximus is marching relentlessly through the dugout and
cramped, serpentine trench-like tunnels that lead to the
arena.

We don't really see Maximus well in the dark tunnels.

Proximo scurries to keep up with him -- they brush past
gladiators who line the walls.  Some are wounded, some are
being attended to by surgeons, some are shell-shocked,
some are nervously waiting to go on, whispering prayers.

We twist and turn in the tunnels with Proximo and Maximus

		Ah... so it's Rome you want.  Well
		you shall have her, Gladiator.  The
		new Emperor has ordered a series of
		matches to culminate in a grand

              one occasionally, to throw him off the

revealing his gouged, blood-soaked neck and his vacant, dead
eyes. Denise starts SCREAMING. Victoria grins.

       Do you know how this war will end,
       Haeften? The portrait will be un-
       hung... And the man will be hung.

Stauffenberg looks up - looking for a reaction to
such frank and treasonous talk. He gets none. He
sighs, too tired to play games.

              STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
       Bottom line. I'm engaged in high
       treason with all means available to
       me. Can I count you in?

                                                       42.



     And the strangest thing - a reaction no one would
     suspect - Haeften relaxes, almost sighs, like someone
     who has at long last found a home.

                          HAEFTEN
            For anything, sir. Anything at all.

The boys are all young and spread out. There are people lying on the couch, on the floor, on the phone, in the kitchen smoking pot and doing wip-its. They are all colors and sizes.

Casper and Telly go to each person and greet them with a handshake. Some people they hug. They say "Was up," to everyone.

They both sit down on the floor and continue to drink their beers.

Paul sits down besides them.

PAUL
What are you guys doing?

TELLY
Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.

PAUL
You want a wip-it?

TELLY
Nah.

          This town is so small and adorable.
          It's like out of a Demi Moore
          movie.

          Clarke's company is about forty-
          five minutes from here. This town
          seemed so perfect when we were
          looking for a house. There's no
          traffic, there's one coffee house,
          one bookstore, one market. No
          crime. But after you've lived her
          a few years you hunger for another
          coffee shop, a bigger bookstore,
          and a little crime. It gets so
          boring. And it's such a small
          town, God forbid you miss one of
          you kid's soccer games, they put
          the scarlet letter on you.

          it can't be that bad. You live on
          a pretty little ranch. You have
          horses, a duck. It must be a nice
          life.

          LAURA
          We used to have so much fun. I
          don't think I have that much fun
          anymore. I don't like who I'm
          turning into. Is the fun over? I
          have to get up every morning at
          six, drive my kids to school and
          then I have 6 hours before I have
          to pick them up. I have to yell at
          them to do their homework, be a
          taskmaster, then I make them
          dinner.

          removing her bathrobe in the process. Without ever speaking,
          she pulls the covers over both of them and begins to make

EXT. DAN PIENAAR SECONDARY SCHOOL FOR BOYS - DAY

Dan Pienaar school is a typical Johannesburg Afrikaan
school. The students are mainly from middle-class
families. School athletics are in progress. The stu-
dents, in their smart school uniforms, are cheering
enthusiastically a relay race on the immaculately-kept
sports ground.
GORDON NGUBENE, a 47-years-old African laborer is work-
ing in the school garden. A few feet away is his 15-
years-old son JONATHAN leaning against a wall watching
the games.
BEN DU TOIT, a 50-year-old Afrikaaner history teacher, is
enthusiastically cheering his son JOHAN, a 15-years-old,
who is leading neck-and-neck with another boy in the last
leg of the race. The excitement increases as they
approach the tape. Ben is beside himself, egging his son
with shouts. The young teacher, VIVIERS, standing next
to Ben, is shouting "come on Johan," and slapping the
father on the back.
Johan breasts the tape just ahead of the other boy. The
ground is invaded by boys running to congratulate Johan.
Ben hurries towards his happy but exhausted son; the proud
father pushing his way through the animated boys. As he
reaches Johan he pats him on the back.
                           BEN
             This was your best race.

      It hits Rose that she does not belong here. And for the first
      time, she does not want to belong here. She turns to Paula.

                             ROSE
                   You know what? I... uh...Actually,
                   there's somewhere I need to be.

                             PAULA
                   Oh nooo! You can't leave now. We're
                   just starting the games.

                             ROSE
                   Yeah. Well...
                       (smiles and nods)
                   Yeah.

      Rose stands and weaves her way through the throng of Stepford
      moms. Relief sweeps across her face as she nears the door.

      Rose pulls up near the fire trucks and still smoldering
      house. Rose steps from the car with an expression of horror.

      Fear grips her as she scans the area for her sister. Then she
      sees Norah, sitting in the van across the street. Headphones
      on. Kitten curled up in her lap.

      Rose marches over but Norah doesn't notice her until she raps
      on the window. Norah pulls off her headphones, opens the door
      and slides out of the van.

                             NORAH
                   It was an accident.

      Rose's mouth slackens as her mind stumbles over the probable
      consequences of the scene before her.

          FADE TO CARD: ...IF HE'S SLEEPING WITH SOMEONE ELSE

          
          MARIEL (50's, highly manicured, upper class type) sits on
          a yacht in what looks to be the French Riviera.

          

                                 MARIEL
                    My first husband was unimpressive. I
                    found him in bed with his big breasted
                    secretary when I came home early from the
                    Maldives. So unoriginal, it made me feel
                    sorry for him. My second husband was a
                    pinch more creative. Cheated on me with
                    my sister - but made me believe that I
                    was insane for being suspicious. At last
                    - some intrigue, some mind games - though
                    my sister's two year old eventually gave
                    them up. But my last husband -- he was a
                    gem. A veritable master at covering his
                    tracks. I poured over his phone records,
                    intercepted his credit card bills, had
                    him followed on countless occasions - and
                    never found a single shred of evidence.
                    It wasn't until he died that I found out
                    about the property he owned with his
                    Austrian mistress. But the real master,
                    I have to say -- is me. Three husbands --
                    countless boyfriends, and I haven't been
                    caught yet.

          A somber Rebecca stares at herself in the full-length mirror
          on the back of the front door. A very strange expression in
          her eyes. She looks herself over, makes a fist, and now...
          Punches herself on the temple. Hard. She staggers, nearly
          knocked out. She straightens. Looks in the mirror. Her skin
          is already bruising. She punches herself again. Same spot.
          And again, with her other fist this time. And now a shot to
          her shoulder. And another. It's painful to watch. But she's
          getting more and more numb to the blows.
          She inspects herself closely... and now reaches down and
          grabs an artist's UTILITY KNIFE. It looks like a large,
          retractable box cutter. She extends the blade all the way
          out. She pulls up her shirt. Turns to the side a bit. Places
          the knife against her skin and...

Drama, Romance, War, 
			RODERICK (V.O.)
	After making suitable arrangements
	for the Chevalier's burial, in
	proper accord with his church, I
	traveled to Spa, which was now in
	season, alone, to continue my
	profession which formerly had the
	support of my friend and mentor.

INT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Crowds surround Roderick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was by this time one of the best-
	known characters in Europe; and the
	fame of my exploits, my duels, my
	courage at play, would bring crowds
	round me in any public society where
	I appeared.

INT.  CASINO - NIGHT

Attractive women alone, while men are at the gaming table.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The passion for play is stronger
	than the passion for gallantry; the
	gamester at Spa has neither time to
	stop to consider the merits of a
	woman, nor the courage to make
	sacrifices for her.

EXT.  GARDEN IN SPA - DAY

The Countess of Cosgrove walks beside her husband, Sir
William Cosgrove, who is in a wheelchair.  They are
accompanied by their young son, Lord Brookside, and two
servants.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	In evoking the recollections of
	these days, I have nothing but
	pleasure.  I would if I could say as
	much of a lady who will henceforth
	play a considerable part in the
	drama of my life -- I mean the
	Countess of Cosgrove, whose fatal
	acquaintance I made at Spa, very
	soon after the tragic events which
	caused me to quit Germany.

52 INT. SPAPROW'S CHINESE PAGODA NIGHT

A low and lunatic place: a combination of an opium dream out of the
Arabian Nights and a panel from a Bosch triptych. FAN-TAN games played by
Orientals; WOMEN and CHILDREN of various colors suspended in cages from
the ceiling as MEN and WOMEN in a secondfloor GALLERY point at them and
JOKE. On the main floor, a long line waits for a shot at the barrel of
All-Sorts. Jack charges in the front door, looks around.

JACK
All right, step out, you yellow...

All the NOISE subsides. Only the Fan-Tan game continues;

nothing is so interesting that these Orientals will stop gambling.

Now Amsterdam STEPS right in front of him. It's a grandstand play.

AMSTERDAM
Hello, Happy Jack. I'm the one you're looking for.

JACK
Then you're marked for dead.

Jack lunges ahead, swinging his NIGHT STICK. Amsterdam throws a chair
across his path. Jack stumbles, goes down, dropping his night stick.
Amsterdam grabs it, jumps on top of him, HITS him twice on the side of the
head. There is a CRACKING SOUND. The PATRONS of the Pagoda gather round.

           He was institutionalized. For suggesting
           that washing your hands before putting
           them inside someone else's body was a
           good idea. High functioning people can
           live under the spell of an inexplicable
           mental lapse when they think as a group.
           Why isn't anybody else doing it? Because
           they don't think guys who look like you
           are what win baseball games. They know it
           for sure.

           video room computer, works on a computer in his room,
           prints two pages of data and reviews.

           In which case I'm a 44 year old guy with
           a high-school diploma and a daughter who
           I'd like to be able to put through
           college one day.
           (lets it sink in)
           You're 25 years old with a degree from
           Yale and a pretty impressive
           apprenticeship.

                          (BEAT)
           I don't think we're asking the right
           question. I think the question we're
           supposed to be asking now is, do you
           believe in what we're doing or not?

                          (BEAT)
           It's a problem that you think we need to
           explain ourselves. Don't... to anyone.
           I'm going to see this through, for better
           or for worse. Just tell me, do you
           project we'll win more games with Pe�a or
           Hatteberg on first?

           It's close Billy but theoretically
           Hatteberg.

           What are we talking about then?

           That works. Great. There's just one more
           thing I need. I don't want the guys
           paying for soda--I want you to stock my
           soda machine for three years. Uh huh, uh
           huh, great... then that's a deal.

           I'm gonna cost us a hundred runs.

           16.5 actually. But as a hitter, you will
           create 70 runs. 70 runs wins us an awful
           lot of ball games. I can live with that.

           Here's the thing -- we changed the game.
           We got this year, maybe next, then
           they're gonna catch on. This is our
           moment. I want to go the distance. I
           wanna shove it up the Yankees' ass. Not
           just the Yankees, but... these guys
           deserve it.

                          TARA
           You deserve it. Honey, 20 games. It's a
           record.

                          BILLY
           That's right, it's just a record. It
           gets buried in some book. Come on, tell
           me who won 19? I don't even know. It's
           4th place at the Olympics. Any other
           team wins the World Series this year...
           great. We're still in the record books.
           But if we win, we've changed the game.
           We've put it on its head and shoved it up
           their ass. If we don't, they're gonna
           erase us.

               This is the worst start to a season
               Leeds has had in twenty years. Four

		What the hell is that supposed to

		It means that you and your buddies

			(stunned)
		War games? Thailand? That's not true!
		How can you believe that? Can't you

GEARY takes a swig of his COKE and begins walking away. JACOB, enraged, 
charges after him. With a wild swipe he sends the COKE CAN shooting out 
of GEARY's hand. It reverberates down the corridor. GEARY is stunned.

				JACOB
		You slimy bastard! You goddamn piece
		of shit!

With a powerful thrust, JACOB rips the sandwich from GEARY's other 
hand. Tossing it on the floor, he grinds his heel in it. Tomato and 
mayonnaise squirt onto GEARY's shoe. JACOB turns away.


CUT TO JACOB walking down the COURT HOUSE CORRIDOR to the elevators. 
There is a look of satisfaction on his face.

CUT TO JACOB stepping onto the elevator. The doors close. The Muzak is 
playing "Sonny Boy" with Al Jolson singing. JACOB is surprised to hear 
it. He presses the down button for the main floor.


The elevator stops at the LOBBY. The doors open swiftly. SEVERAL

INT.  JACOB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

THE BEDROOM is dark. JACOB and JEZZIE are making love. A half-
smoked joint is smouldering in an ashtray by the bed. JEZZIE is 
poised on top of JACOB and his eyes are focused on her face.

A hurricane lamp casts a warm glow over their bodies. Its 
flickering light plays games with JACOB's eyes and for a moment 
JEZZIE seems to disappear. JACOB reaches out for her breasts and 
his hands seem to vanish into the shadows dancing across her. 
With sudden, hallucinogenic impact, JACOB feels himself drawn 
into a starry universe opening from inside her.

THE CAMERA plunges through her image into a galxy of stars and 
rushes toward one that is twinkling brightly. Pulsations of its 
light whiten the screen. Out of the whiteness appears a momentary 
flash of the CELESTIAL STAIRCASE, accompanied by sounds of sexual 
climax.

The STAIRCASE sparkles for an instant and then it's gone. The 
sparkle becomes a glimmer in JEZZIE's eye as her face fills the 
screen. She looks especially lovely and radiant. Her image moves 
with the lamplight.

JACOB's face is ecstatic. He can barely talk and simply basks in 
JEZZIE's glow. Slowly, she leans forward and whispers in his ear.

				JEZZIE
		So tell me ... am I still an angel?

				JACOB
			(smiling broadly)
		With wings.
			(he strokes her hair)
		You transport me, you know that? You
		carry me away.

          WE HEAR A PERSISTENT C SHARP COMING FROM A DISTANT PIANO.
          It's a familiar, baleful SOUND that continues over the

          INT. WILL'S STUDY - DAY

          Will sits in front of the computer, looking at a file crammed

          (into computer mic)
          Caesar continues to maintain a high
          level of cognition. But Walter's
          disease has caught up to the
          neurogenesis treatment. Nearly all
          initial improvement has been
          erased...
          Will stops recording. KICKS his desk in frustration.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Walter sits at the piano, hitting his one note.
          Caesar passes him, heads for Will's study.

          INT. WILL'S STUDY - DAY

          Caesar enters, finds Will at the desk, head in hands. Will
          senses his presence. Looks up.

          One thing you can count on: Long as
          there are humans on this earth,
          you'll always be a monkey in a
          cage.
          The BURST from the HOSE sends Caesar flying backwards.
          Pinned into a corner, he curls himself into a ball, using his
          back as a shield.
          The water BLAST is relentless.
          Eventually, Dodge turns the water off. The two men take a
          long look at Caesar. He's left battered and soaked on the
          floor.

          EXT. BACK YARD - DAY

          Walter's frail hand runs along the cold rail of Caesar's
          swing set. Empty. Useless in the back yard.
           The Aide stands nearby, sending a text message.

          INT. WILL'S HOUSE - DAY

          Will looks terrible. He's unshaven, pale, drawn. He sits on
          the sofa, surrounded by reminders of Caesar - puzzles, games,
          etc. The newspaper's unread beside him.

               Willy is pointing at Jennifer - shocked -
               - as the Med Tech lets him up and they kneel by her, the Med
               Tech taking her pulse - Willy, staring down at her, intent:
               She's breathing.

                                             WILLY
                           Yes.     Yes.
               Willy whirls around to Crawford.        Who's frowning.

                                        WILLY
                           You messed up. With all your plans
                           and games.
               Willy turns back to Jennifer. Delicately strokes the side of
               her face. Her eyes flutter open -

                                          WILLY
                           Shhhh.    It's okay.       It's all right.
               - she stares into Willy's eyes. He takes her hand.        Silent
               awe in her eyes. Yearning. Fear.

                                        WILLY
                           You're gonna be okay?
               She squeezes his hand.      Very weakly.
               Crawford is looking daggers: die, bitch.
               Jennifer's eyes - fixed on Willy - roll back.        She fights it.
