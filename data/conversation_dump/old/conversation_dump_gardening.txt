     Bucky steps over the police rope and into the study. A large
     desk chair lies overturned an the ground next to A TAPE

     Behind the chair the brown spattering of blood and brains
     decorates the white wall and crown mouldings.

           I can always get you a research
           position at the V&amp;A when you've
           grown up a bit and got this film
           idea out of your system...
           COLIN's smiles but before he can reply JANE CLARK whirls into
           the room, a ball of energy, talking nineteen to the dozen.

                          JANE
           Kenneth, you might have told Cook
           we were another two for dinner.
           What is everyone supposed to eat?
           Cabbage soup? Oh, Colin, darling,
           there you are...

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 2A.

                         
           She looks wonderful in a good quality but elderly dress,
           eccentrically combined with gardening attire, her mind on a
           dozen things at once.

                          COLIN
           I'm off now, Mama.

                          JANE
           Off?

                          COLIN
           My job interview, remember..?
           But she is already continuing her journey. COLIN smiles
           hurriedly at KENNETH, who gives him an affectionate wave as
           COLIN dashes after his mother. She leaves the Library.

		Try this.  I found a great jar of it.  
		Olive oil.  In Naples this was so
		precious it would have bought you a wife.

			KIP
		Thank you.

She stands for a second, then walks away.  Kip examines the oil, calls 
after her.

		Yes, for your hair.


122	EXT.    THE MONASTERY.    HANA'S GARDEN.    DAY.

HANA IS GARDENING, close to the crucifix, which is now a full-fledged 
Scarecrow.  Broken bottles, fragments of stained glass and shards from 
a mirror are hung from the crossbar, syringes too, all jangling and 
tinkling and catching the sunlight.

Kip and Hardy drive off to work on their motorcycles.  She watches 
them, catching Kip's careless wave to her.  She looks briefly at 
herself in A PIECE OF MIRROR dangling from the Scarecrow.


123	INT.    THE MONASTERY.    UPSTAIRS LANDING.    DAY.

Hana walks along the landing with a tray.  There's a message on several 
doors in the corridor from Kip: SAFE, then a couple with the warning: 
DANGER.  She hears noise from the Patient's room.  Listens for a second 
before going in.

		You have to read Kipling slowly!
		Your eye is too impatient - think
		about the speed of his pen.

		What is it - He sat comma in defiance
		of municipal orders comma astride the
		gun Zamzammah on her brick... What is it?

     Half-assed gardening party. Al-Ghazi worked through the

            You shouldn't be driving around, you know.
            You're sick.

                               ERIN
            Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of
            these folks aren't.

     He nods, understanding.  Then he taps the side of her truck
     and turns toward the motel room.  She puts the truck in gear

     Donna's gardening out front, her head wrapped in a scarf to

            I don't know, Erin -- the way he was talking
            to us, telling us everything was gonna be
            fine -- I just didn't trust him.

                               PETE
            And after all we been through -- no jury, no

                               ERIN
            I understand all that. And I don't wanna
            force you into anything.  If you don't want
            to sign, that's fine.  But why don't we talk
            it over a little, cause I'd sure hate for
            you to turn this down for the wrong reasons.

          Fatty behind my back. Or Fatso. Or,
          facetiously, Slim. But I also believe
          this is simply my own perverted form of
