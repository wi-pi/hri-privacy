             Well, it wasn't <i>that</i> easy.  I mean, I had to
             really check up on it.  And every picture of
             you in those books is forty years old, at 
             least.  I went back to the library to find 
             the picture.  And then I matched it with the
             photos I took.

                          DUSSANDER 
             You took photographs of me? 

                          TODD 
             Yeah, I got this little camera.  Fits right
             in the palm of my hand.

             But even then I couldn't be sure.  I needed
             real proof.  So I went to the mall and bought
             a fingerprint kit from the hobby shop and a
             book that tells you what you're supposed to
             look for and then dusted your mailbox while
             you were at the movies.  Pretty smart, huh? 

                          DUSSANDER 
             You... put dust on my mailbox?  For 
             fingerprints?  You took photographs of me? 
             What else did you do?... I don't believe any
             of this. 

                          TODD 
             I already had a copy of your fingerprints. 
             They're on your want sheet from the Israeli
             government.  It's on database at UC Irvine.
             Can you believe that?

     Oscar plays with an extraction cleaner and accidently turns
     it on. Winston gives him a nod that indicates that he should
     turn it off. He does.

                  Well I'd never been to Greece. Or
                  Europe. Or outside New Jersey.

                            BLOOM
                  It just seems like a big leap.
                  From where you were at yesterday to
                  being a world traveler.

                  A new hobby.

     Up ahead, Bloom spots a large man in a fur collared cape

                  Pleased to make your acquaintance.
                  Bloom's told me about you, you're

               Who is that man? You avoided him
               earlier on the deck.

                         BLOOM
               I don't know, but he's carrying a
               knife up his sleeve and wearing a
               cape. Do me a favor and steer
               clear of him.

     A waltz drifts through the air from a band unseen.

               dance?

                         PENELOPE
               I went through a phase when I was
               mildly obsessed with the Bolero.

               Give me a minute.

     He leaves her alone. Clouds obscure the moon, shadows
     deepen. She shivers.

     A match strikes.   She jumps.

     The moon re-emerges, and she is no longer alone on the deck.
     The Curator lights a dapper briar pipe, shakes out the match.

             I'm sorry...
                 (bends down and picks up
                  the envelope)
             ... I was about to knock. I'm

             Thank you.

Through the open door, Atwood can see Mr. Smith's camera on a
table and the collapsed tripod leaning against the wall.

                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
             Are you a photographer...

             Mr. Baffert?

                       MR. SMITH
             No... eh, it's kind of a hobby, I
             just started.

                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
             I don't know if you're aware but
             there was a murder...

                       MR. SMITH
             Oh, yes in the house across the
             alley...

                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
             Did you happen to see anything
             unusual or suspicious that night
             around that house? Anything at all?

Mr. Smith puts on his thinking expression and pauses a little
bit before:

                       MR. SMITH
             No... I wondered that when I heard
             what happened, but... no.
                 (looks at his watch)
             I'm sorry, I'm meeting someone and
             I don't want to be late.

                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
             Are you positive? Because we found
             potter's clay on the carpet of the
             murder house and I was sure you
             said to me that you worked with
             clay, that you made pots.

                       MR. SMITH
             No. I said my hobby was
             photography, not pottery.

                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
             Maybe that was it. The Stewardess
             upstairs said the victims kept
             their curtains open when they made
             love. Could I see some of the
             pictures you took of that Couple?

Mr. Smith can only stare at Detective Atwood. His Adam's
apple moves up and down though he makes no sound. Should he
or shouldn't he?

Finally he throws his arms up in a shrug but in his half-turn
of indecision he happens to spy the Newspaper he tossed at
the passenger seat of his car.

Part of it is draped over the console. The red circles around
the words on that page jump out at him.

             Don't - be - stupid -.

Mr. Smith returns his attention to Detective Atwood.

                       MR. SMITH
             You are harassing me, Detective
             Atwood. You know very well I'm not
             a potter and I don't have any
             pictures! So my feeling is that
             your feeling is wrong and that you
             should move your car and let me go
             home.

          INT. THE LIBRARY, BLAIR HOUSE, WASHINGTON - EVENING
                         
          Lincoln's perched on the edge of an ottoman.
           20.

           the amendment.
                         
          The room is baronial. PRESTON BLAIR, patriarch of his wealthy
          and powerful family, 72 years old, sits facing his son,
          MONTGOMERY BLAIR, 50, whip-thin. A fire blazes in a massive
          fireplace behind Monty. Preston's handsome, elegant daughter,
          ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE, 45, sits across from Monty, next to Tad,
          who's wearing a Union infantryman's uniform, a real musket by
          his side.

           All Republicans ought to be
           conservative, I founded this party -
           in my own goddamned home - to be a
           conservative antislavery party, not
           a hobbyhorse for goddamned radical
           abolitionists and -

                          (TO LINCOLN:)
           You need us to keep the
           conservative side of the party in
           the traces while you diddle the
           radicals and bundle up with
           Thaddeus Stevens's gang. You need
           our help.

                      tell you it's been under

                      Kafka.

        Walking away, Kafka notices Gabriela striding along an office

        GABRIELA

        She looks distressed, walking tall as if to bolster her
        composure.  Sneaky Burgel does not help matters by
        characteristically appearing from the sidelines.

                                  BURGEL
                      Good morning --

           Oh. There was one other thing: Did he

He shrugs, dismissing it:

           It's nothing. Trace elements we found on
           his trunk. Any interest in chemistry?
           Maybe as a hobby?

              It's already your interest or
              hobby. When they ask you "What's
              your interest or hobby?" at your

              "Cello". That wouldn't be a lie.

              hobby. A hobby is a hobby.
