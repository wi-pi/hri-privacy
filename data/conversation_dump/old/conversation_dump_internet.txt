             No. We could, but then we wouldn't

                         You can't blame yourself for not 
                         being here. You did all you could 
                         for her.

          Why is no one saying the obvious? 
          This is just a rash case of
          copycats.  Someone, somewhere, does
          the first one.  It's on TV, it's on

          He has no internet access to the
          house. He makes no phone calls either
          in or out. Who's he selling to,
          who's he buying from, how's he making
          his money? And if you're going to
          say he's retired, I'd say where's
          his swimming pool, where's the gold
          cage with the falcons? And why does
          he send his courier to the two cities
          in Pakistan we most associate with
          Al Qaeda, that have nothing
          particularly to do with heroin
