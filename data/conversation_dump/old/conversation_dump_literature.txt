                         She gets off in an hour, so I think 
                         I'm just going to have a drink and 
                         then... make sure she gets home safe.

                         You're joking, right?
                              (seeing that he isn't)
                         What are you doing? Un-fucking-
                         believeable. Can we just go back to 
                         the hotel and hang out and get up 
                         early and play nine holes before we 
                         head home?

               Jack rests one hand on Miles's shoulder and drops his head, 
               thinking how best to put it.

                         Look, Miles. I know you're my friend 
                         and you care about me. And I know 
                         you disapprove. I respect that. But 
                         there are some things I have to do 
                         that you don't understand. You 
                         understand wine and literature and 
                         movies, but you don't understand my 
                         plight. And that's okay.

    (To Pi:)
Listen: instead of leaping from one
religion to the next, why not start
with reason? In a few hundred
years, science has taken us farther
in understanding the universe than
religion has in ten thousand.

          MOTHER
That is true. Your father is right.
Science can teach us more about
what's out there -

                Some eat meat, some eat vegetable.
                I do not expect us all to agree
                about everything. But I would much
                rather have you believe in
                something I don't agree with than
                to accept everything blindly. And
                that begins with thinking
                rationally. Do you understand?

     Pi nods.

          Harvey EAGERLY APPROACHES anyone and everyone, shaking hands

          Harvey lifts a Briggs flier.

          HARVEY MILK
          If in your statements here you say
          that child molestation is not an
          issue, why do you put out literature
          that hammers it home, why do you play
          on that myth and fear?

          JOHN BRIGGS
          Same thing with VD Harvey, we put
          out publications about VD so you
          can avoid it.

          HARVEY MILK
          (with a grin)
          But you've even admitted that
          there's more molestation in the
          heterosexual group! So why not get
          rid of the heterosexual teachers?
          Boos from the conservative audience.

          JOHN BRIGGS
          We are not talking about homos...
          child molestation, the fact is, at
          least 95 percent of the people are
          heterosexual. If we took
          heterosexuals out AND homosexuals

Allen, with scissors, cuts up pages of the books. Hands them

It's a frantic assembly-line: Bill whips books to Allen,
Allen tears out sections, and Lucien hammers them up.

INT. HARLEM NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Time suddenly slows. The music tapers, the hands of the

confused. What is happening?

A spotlight cuts through the room, capturing the singer's
sweaty ecstasy, the bassist's fingers mid-plucking. The room
freezes.

Unlit cigarette dangling from his lip, Allen turns to Bill.
                                                        31.


Bill holds up his finger - it is on fire. He lights Allen's
cigarette with the flame. We have entered into another

Lucien stands -- the only thing moving -- and Allen follows.
He steps into the frozen moment. And it's beautiful.

          I'm pushing because it'll be a crime if the
          world doesn't hear that you wrote a genius

                    The notion of secrecy is central to
                    Western literature. You may say the
                    whole idea of character in fiction
                    is defined by people holding
                    specific information which for
                    various reasons - sometimes
                    perverse, sometimes noble - they
                    are determined not to disclose.

          There's a knowingness, a swagger, a confidence which is new.

          direction, alone.

          The two of them come together down the corridor. They stop at
          the open door of the cell. The body has been removed. The
          books are still on the floor. MICHAEL goes in. A bare table,
          a chair, a bed, a closet, a toilet in the corner behind the
          door. There are shelves with books, an alarm clock, a stuffed
          bear, two mugs, instant coffee, tea tins.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    She didn't pack. She never intended
                    to leave.
          
          MS BRENNER looks at him in confirmation. MICHAEL looks at the
          two lower shelves on which are ranged the tapes with the
          cassette machine.
          
          Above the bed are a series of cuttings, pictures torn from
          magazines, showing meadows, hillsides, pasture, cherry trees.
          One in particular : a burst of autumnal colours. MICHAEL
          kneels on the bed to look at them. There are quotations,
          articles, recipes, even sayings in HANNA'S childish
          handwriting : `Spring lets its blue banner flutter through
          the air' is one. Then he sees a newspaper photograph : the
          young MICHAEL BERG receiving a prize from the school
          principal. The headline `Michael Berg receives school
          literature prize.'
          
          MS BRENNER reaches out for a tea tin from the shelf. Then she
          sits next to MICHAEL on the bed, and takes out a folded sheet
          of paper from her suit pocket.
          
                              MS BRENNER

                              NICK
                    That rat-fink-fuck!

                              MR. SAUNDERS
                    You watch your language. This is a
                    Christian home. We're sending
                    Sheeni to Les �cole des Arts and
                    Literatures in Santa Cruz.

                              NICK
                    Santa Cruz! But she'll be miserable
                    without me. We're in love.
          The ogre snorts in condescending amusement.

                              MR. SAUNDERS
                    Then I guess it's a good thing
                    Trent is going there too. She'll
                    have someone to console her.
          And with that, Mr. Saunders slams the door so hard in Nick's
          face that the entire two story mobile home rocks back and
          forth.

          EXT. WOODS - DAY

          Nick makes his way past the arbor, crestfallen. Sheeni
          emerges from the shadows in a hooded sweatshirt over a
          lavender dress.

                              SHEENI
                    Nick! Oh, Nick!
          Nick lights up at the sight of her and they embrace. They
          kiss passionately. He works his way to her neck and starts to
          reach under the sweatshirt.

          I just had the most extraordinary phone
          chat with my daughter. She told me that
          she and her friends are all talking about
          the race, which ended just, a half-hour
          ago, via their computers. A new website
          called Facebook. Do you have this in
          America?

          No no. Cambridge. Majoring in French
          Literature, though I wasn't aware there
          was such a thing.

          tell. because that's where her friends
          are.

          I'm going to find your mother.

           (chuckles)(back in her book)
           See you in a few. Yup.

          14 EXT. SCHENECTADY THEATER - 2006 - DAY14

          Caden has the phone to his ear. He's squinting in the bright
          sunlight, pupils dilated. The gaunt man watches him unseen.

          CADEN
          Dr. Heshborg said I should see Dr.
          Scariano. My pupils don't work.

          15 INT. SCHENECTADY THEATER BOX OFFICE - 2006 - CONTINUOUS 15

          Hazel reads the first page of Swann's Way. The other volumes
          of In Search of Lost Time are stacked neatly nearby. She
          looks up and sees Caden standing outside the box office
          window watching her.

          HAZEL
          I keep reading the first line.
          It's a good line, I think. But I
          don't know much about literature.

          CADEN
          Maybe you should read the first
          line of another series of books.

          HAZEL
          I'm trying to better myself, Caden.
          Recommend me something. You're a
          genius; you must've read nearly a
          dozen books.

          CADEN
          Exactly twelve. Have you read
          Kafka?

Title: American History X
Genres:
Crime, Drama, Thriller, 
          RASMUSSEN
Three years ago a local kid named
Derek Vinyard gets sent up for
murdering a couple of Crips who were
trying to jack his car. Bob taught
Vinyard back in high school and has
followed the case closely.

              YOUNG COP
He was a skinhead, right?

          SWEENEY
Derek was more like...the skinhead.
He and Cameron Alexander.

COP #2

Who?

Rasmussen opens a FILE in front of him. There rests
Derek's mug shot. He flips it over and reveals
CAMMERON'S MUG SHOT. Front and side view.

          RASMUSSEN
Cammeron Alexander is probably the
biggest writer and distributor of
white power literature in LA County.
He promotes white power bands, writes
reviews, columns, all at the ripe age
of forty.

             YOUNG COP
     (smiling)
He's forty? Jesus.

          RASMUSSEN
Pretty clean record...runs everything
out of his house down by the beach.

          SWEENEY
There weren't any organized white
gangs around Venice before those two
hooked up. Very few, if any. It was
mostly just black and Mexican. But it
was tiny. They hit it off though...
and Alexander hit the jackpot with
Derek.

Rasmussen reaches over and pushes play on a VCR.
