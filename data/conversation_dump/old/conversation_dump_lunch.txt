          INT. CANTEEN. PRISON. DAY
          
          MS BRENNER leads MICHAEL to the door of the canteen.
          
                              MS BRENNER
                    They're in the canteen. They're
                    just finishing lunch.
          
          MICHAEL sees an OLD WOMAN who is sitting at a table. Her blue
          dress is stretched too tight across her heavy body. Her hair
          is grey. She has a book in her lap, but she's not reading it.
          A few PRISONERS are finishing their meal.
          
          It takes MICHAEL a moment to realise the OLD WOMAN is HANNA.
          Then HANNA becomes aware of being watched. She turns and
          looks round. At once her face lights up. MICHAEL smiles back,
          but as he approaches her, he fixes onto her inquiring look
          and sees the light go out of her eyes, as if she has looked
          at him and been disappointed. He sits down opposite her. She
          smiles, weary.

               after lunch.

      She brazenly stares a hole through Butch as she lifts a slice
      of pickle off his plate, places it in her mouth and slowly
      chews.
      Phillip, mouth full, takes note of the confusing spectacle.
      Eileen turns to walk away.

               If you need me, I'll be right over here.
      She slowly sashays away to behind the counter.
      Butch watches her every step. Phillip chews and watches
      Butch's eyes. Butch turns his head and catches Phillip
      watching him.

      A SIRLOIN STEAK hits a grill beside a Tater Tot shiskabob and
      SIZZLES to beat the band.
      A homemade barbecue pit, built from nearby abundant rocks,
      sits square in the middle of the highway with red flares set
      up just in case a car did come by.
      Red smiles and shakes a liberal dose of Lea and Perrins onto
      the flesh. He's obviously a veteran of many back yard B-BQs
      and this is definitely one.
      We see Sally THROUGH the window. She's inside, still going
      over her files. She gets up and walks into the back room to
      look for something.

back behind Mr. Eddy, sitting in the passenger seat of the
car - a beautiful blonde-haired GIRL, who looks exactly like 
Renee.

CLOSE UP BEAUTIFUL GIRL - she looks exactly like Renee except
she is about eight years younger.  The girl is staring right 
into Pete's eyes.

Pete.  Mr. Eddy smiles at Pete - not noticing or not letting 
on that he notices the serious eye contact going on between 
Pete and the girl.

           No thanks.

           But I'd like one of these paintings.

She walks off.

           Who's that?

           You slut. How do you know Bruno

                      ANDY WARHOL
           Well, have you asked her to come back?

Jean shakes his head `no,' sorry that he didn't.


INT. BARBETTA'S (RESTAURANT) - DAY

A medium-sized dining room with dark wood paneling and tastefully
appointed furnishings.

Jean and Gina enter. Gina looks considerably more conservative
than previously - more like a student. Jean's dressed well, but
looks even more careworn than usual. His hair is tied back with a
necktie. He has a couple sores on his face. His skin looks a
little puffy.

The MAITRE'D smiles at Jean and bows -

                      MAITRE'D
           Mr. Basquiat - what a pleasure to see you
           again.

                      BASQUIAT
           Hey George, what's up?

A huge table with NINE WHITE EXECUTIVES. WAITERS clear their
lunch settings. As they spot Jean and Gina entering, they gawk
and snicker.

George leads them to their table. As they take their seats, Jean
notices the suppressed giggles coming from the executives' table.
They try to ignore it. George disappears.

Jean seems self-conscious about the sores on his face.

                      GINA
           So are you really friends with Andy? He
           seems like such a weirdo.

                      BASQUIAT
           He's not. He's out of town and he calls me
           every day. What's weird about him?

                      GINA
           Don't you think he's using you?

          Small soybean plants slouch in the noonday sun. A slight
          breeze picks up, jostling the leaves, but the sound is
          drowned out by a loud, mechanical rumbling.
          A spiral drill churns up dark soil as it digs deeper into the
          ground. Curtis, wearing work goggles, grabs hold of the
          drill's cabling system and yanks down.

           Yeah, let's keep going with that
           bit! It'll go another 10 feet!
          He yells to DEWART(36), a big guy sitting at the controls of

sandwich, but he shakes his head.

                           CATCH
             No thanks. I can't eat and have a
             heart attack at the same time.

She smiles again and takes a bite and stares off, and
soon enough her dark thoughts come and cover her, and
Catch notices.

                           CATCH
             As soon as you get happy, you get
             sad.

                            SHARON
             I'm okay.   Everything's code four.

                           CATCH
             Everything's what?

             Someplace I've never been kissed.

She smiles, staring, then slowly reaches her hands to his
face, gently closes his eyes and is about to kiss him on
the closed lids, but she changes her mind and instead
puts her lips tenderly on each of the small scars on his
face. Then she moves away. He opens his eyes. She
walks to the shore, moves to her clothes and starts
getting dried and dressed, giving him a soft look.

Catch comes to the shore    to dry himself, but as he
dresses, Sharon glances    at his body -- and the scarring
on his chest and arms.     He is troubled about this,
avoiding her eyes. Then     he makes a decision.

                            CATCH
             They tell me I was in an accident.
             Long time ago.

                           SHARON
             Looks like a bad one.

                           CATCH
             I don't remember it.    I...

She waits -- but he says no more. She continues        to
dress, sliding her shorts over her wet underwear       -- but
before she puts her shirt on, she turns her back       to take
off her wet bra. He glances at her. She looks         over and
catches him glancing. They both smile softly,
ironically, as they finish dressing.

                           SHARON
             We should be thinking about lunch.
             We have to pack up.

             Some of us have to work.

             You ever work?

         Yeah.     I worked.

               (they all shake hands)
          Harry's sort of a new friend. I think I

          get out of the city for a few days.

          No, no, no. Don't be silly. Uh, look,

          leave. We took a great walk on the beach,
          we'll go into town for lunch. You two

          It's such a great part. It's supporting

          There's this totally hilarious scene
          where she's dating this like chauvinist
          older guy and just as they're about to do
          it, the guy moans and she thinks he's
          just really into her, right? Except he's
          having a heart attack and she's like
          creeped out and her mother, who basically
          despises the guy, rushes in, gives him
          CPR and saves his life.

                    PRETTY GIRL

          I'm totally excited about this audition.
          It's such a great part. It's supporting
          but she's a really funny character.
          There's this totally hilarious scene
          where she's dating this like chauvinist
          older guy and just as they're about to do
          it, the guy moans and she thinks he's
          just really into her, right? Except he's
          having a heart attack and she's like
          creeped out and her mother, who basically
          despises the guy, rushes in, gives him
          CPR and saves his life.

                        like that has often developed a
                        taste for it over time. Occurred
                        to me it might be easy enough to
                        follow his backtrail and find out.
                        A man his size, and colored to
                        boot, can't be that hard to trace.

       back tomorrow ?

Hedra starts taking her arm, and then moves away inside the
kitchen.

       HEDRA
       Why don't you just... sit down.

       No, I'm fine.

Hedra tries to get some water at the sink, but just gets a strange
noise.

       It's only this one. The one in the bathroom works. Here...

She comes to the sink, and takes a wrench lying by the sink.

       I use a wrench.

She squeezes the water faucet with the wrench. Hedra puts her bag

225. EXT. BEAUMONTS' BACK YARD - DAY

A huge low roaring sound comes in.

SLOWLY WE COME UP OUT OF A HUGE DARK HOLE. We see we are rising out of an 
ear but still among the crevices.  They look enormous.  We move up and 
float above the ear and traverse across a cheek to an eye.  Jeffrey's eye. 
His face is bathed in light.

All sorts of springtime-in-the-garden sounds are heard.

We suddenly see that Jeffrey is sleeping in his back yard. Detective 
Williams is with Mr. Beaumont working in the garden in the distance.  
The sprinkler is turning.  Sandy comes out on the back porch and calls.

					SANDY
			Jeffrey. Lunch is ready.

Jeffrey opens his eyes.  He looks around confused for a moment.  He sees 
Sandy.

					JEFFREY
			Okay. I'll be right in.

Sandy goes back inside.  Suddenly, a big red ROBIN chirps loudly above.  
Jeffrey looks up at it sitting in the cherry tree.  The Robin and Jeffrey 
seems to exchange a special look.

Jeffrey smiles up at the fat bird.

He gets off the lawn chair and walks away from us toward the back door of 
the house.  As he passes his father and Detective Williams:

					JEFFREY
			How ya doin' Dad?

					MR. BEAUMONT
				     (distant voice)
			Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.

					JEFFREY
			Good deal Dad.

	No problem at all. I think you know
	where the front office is.

It takes a moment for the words to work their way
out of Jeff Spicoli's mouth.

			SPICOLI 
	You... dick.

In the tense moment that follows, no one in the
class is sure what might happen.

Mr. Hand simply turns away from Jeff Spicoli as if
he ceased to exist and coolly continues his
lecture.

			MR. HAND 
	I've taken the time to print up a
	complete schedule of class quizzes,
	and the chapters they cover. Please
	pass them back to the desks behind
	you...

Hand begins passing out stacks of purple
mimeographed sheets.

ANGLE ON STUDENTS

all smelling the purple mimeographed sheets.

Still standing in the doorway, hyperventilating
with fifteen-year-old adrenalin, is Jeff Spicoli.
After a time, he fishes a few bits of his ad card
out of the wastebasket and huffs out of the room.

EXT. RIDGEMONT LUNCH COURT - AFTERNOON

It's packed. The school's outdoor dining area is
actually just a small courtyard lined with fast
food machines and dominated by a large oak tree in
the center. Standing at the center of lunch court,
under the large oak tree, is Brad Hamilton and his
golf-cap Buddies.

			BRAD 
	You hear about the surfer in Mr.
	Hand's class?

His Buddies shake their heads.

			BRAD (CONT'D)
	Told Hand to fuck off.

			BRAD'S BUDDIES 
	Whoa!_

Brad sees another friend pass through lunch court.

			BRAD 
	Thompson!

Brad waits for him to pass.

MONTAGE OF SHOTS

as we see Ridgemont High gearing up for its big
Homecoming Game against Lincoln. We see a series of
shots of kids talking about it, wagering on the
chances of a Ridgemont victory. We see the many
signs and placards all over school, proclaiming
Ridgemont revenge. We see students lining up to
vote for Homecoming King and Queen in the
gymnasium. It is the most spirit that Ridgemont has
shown this year.

EXT. RIDGEMONT SCHOOL - FLAGPOLE - DAY

From the back of the parking lot, we see a crowd
around the flagpole. A group of kids are staring at
something. They sadly shake their heads at the
sight, as if they are witnessing a funeral.

As we draw closer, we see the center of commotion.
It is an ugly sight. Someone had wrecked Charles
Jefferson's Blue Scholarship Mustang and welded it
to the flagpole. Spray-painted on the side was the
message: LINCOLN SURF PUNKS RULE.

EXT. RIDGEMONT BLEACHERS - NIGHT

The Ridgemont football bleachers are full of
cheering students. We see the same basic groups
from lunch court, and many more.

The cheerleaders are on the field -- Cindy Carr,
Dina Phillips and company -- and their cheerleader
"husbands" sit directly in front of them in the
stands. Linda and Stacy sit in the bleachers with
some of the Swenson's girls. The Rat and Damone sit
several rows above them, watching. The teachers sit
together in another section.

ANGLE ON BRAD HAMILTON

who is again sitting alone in the bleachers.
Watching. Several old lunch court friends pass by,
on their way to the concession area.

Mr. Hand has now gathered all his material, and he
stands to approach Spicoli's door. Jeff jumps up,

Mr. Hand exits the room, and descends the staircase
of the Spicoli household. Spicoli kicks the door
shut, grins, and continues struggling with his tie.

INT. RIDGEMONT GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

Tight angle on the emotion-filled face of the lead
singer in a cheesy high school band called the T
Birds. He is bathed in a blue light, singing the
last verse of The Eagles' 'Take It To The Limit'.

We pull back to reveal a large, clumsy banner
reading: LAST DANCE. Students are pouring into the
gym for this event. Many have brought their annual
yearbooks. On stage, the lead singer snaps his
fingers and the band goes into Nick Lowe's 'Heart
of the City'. Some students start to dance.

Every one of our characters is either here, or
about to arrive. From Charles Jefferson to Spicoli
to Mr. Hand. For once, all classes are partying
together. But, just as in the beginning of the year
on lunch court, the kids are still cordoned off
into their distinctive cliques.

ANGLE ON MORE STUDENTS ARRIVING

at the Last Dance. They see Mr. Hand signing
annuals by the door. They all say the same thing as
they pass, "Aloha, Mr. Hand". He nods in return.

surveying the growing mob of annual-crazed
students. From behind her comes Linda Barrett in a
low-cut black dress.

               Dickie, you can't even drive a car!  No,
               what we need urgently is an icebox. What
               do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll
               be your friend for life.

                         RIPLEY
               I absolutely agree with Marge.

     INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS. DAY.

     Ripley locates his room, puts down his luggage in what is a
     comfortable and simple room, then heads back downstairs only
     to be tempted by the open door of Dickie's bedroom.

     INT. DICKIE'S BEDROOM. DAY.

     Ripley explores the casual elegance of Dickie's bedroom - the
     Louis Vuitton chest, the closet's open door spilling out
     shirts, ties. On the dressing table there are toiletries,
     cufflinks scattered, a silk tie.  Ripley picks up the tie and
     walks towards the open window below which is a terrace where
     lunch is being laid. Marge and Dickie are chatting. Shreds of
     conversation float up to Ripley.

                         DICKIE
               It'll just be for a little while.  He can
               be... he makes me laugh.

                         MARGE
               Okay, darling.

                         DICKIE
               You'd say if you mind?

                         MARGE
               No, I like him.

               No, I like him.

                         DICKIE
               Marge, you like everybody.

                         MARGE
               I don't like you.

                         DICKIE
               Then I'll go to your place and you can
               move in with Tom.

     Above them, Ripley repeats these phrases, carefully, testing
     the cadences, <i>No, I like him. Marge, you like everybody,</i>
     until he's as accurate as a taperecorder.

     EXT. TERRACE OF DICKIE'S HOUSE. DAY.

     Ermelinda is clearing away lunch. Ripley is changed and
     sitting at the table with Marge while Dickie works on the
     coffee. Ripley watches him, studying everything: the way he
     uses the expresso machine, the way he wears no socks, his
     pants, his rings.

                         DICKIE
               Now you know why Miss Sherwood always
               shows up for breakfast.  It's not love
               it's the coffee machine.

                         MARGE
               It's the one task Dickie can do on his
               own - make coffee.

                         DICKIE
               Shut up.

                         MARGE
               Oh darling - is that for me?

           Hey, I'm sorry I kept you waiting but
           believe it or not there was snow on 84.
           The second week in October. The car
           turns on to Yawkee Way and it's 53
           degrees and this. How can there be an
           entirely different weather system here
           than there is three miles from here? Is
           that global warming or a sign that

   TOP OF THE A-500 RIGHT BELOW IT

   We get the joke.  The A-500 with its stealthiness under the
   Aero Commander together like a single footprint.

   AERIAL ANGLE:  TWO PLANES

   piggybacked, enter US airspace and cross the coastline into
   Florida.

   From underneath, the Aero Commander sweeps to the right on
   approach as Tubbs radically dives for the trees, hugging the
   contour at 220 knots at 150 feet...having snuck this plane
   and its load into the United States of America.

We thought we were escaping here. We 
thought we'd found an uninhabited island. 
Christ! This place is a worse nightmare 
than anything I've seen yet!

I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why

gonna put an end to what's happenin' here.

nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a

prayer won't keep one of those monsters

That's why we didn't use prayers on this

destroyed. We ready to fight when we have

Look. I BEEN fightin', mister. I been 
fightin' for what feels like a hundred 
years and I'm finished. I don't need 
religion. I don't need prayers. I need a

on outa here. Find another island where 
there ain't so much....traffic.

You think you can find your boat? There's a 
thousand little inlets and backwaters all 
through here. You remember all the ways you 
turned to get where you are now? You leave 
yourself a trail?

SARAH is stopped by this. She stares at the big man suspiciously, not

We didn't see the exact spot but we know 
about where you landed. But we ain't ready 
to take you there. Not yet. You see...we

Finally Creasy turns, looks at her hard.

Creasy sets up his room with meticulous precision that
comes from years in the military. Front and center he
arranges his shrine: an almost empty bottle of scotch and
a glass (engraved from an earlier encounter) next to a
pack of Marlboros and his weathered Zippo. Then, his
beaten up gun and holster. A well-travelled New
Testament is placed in the drawer.

             protect her, that's enough. I'm
             confident you'll do that.

Lisa stands, is about to start out when she sees his gun
and holster hanging from the corner of the bed. It gives
her pause. Something sexy about it and Creasy's
proximity.

             I didn't realize you had a gun.    I know
             that's silly to say.

Creasy doesn't answer, just watches her.

He stands in the dark, in front of the glow of the

9mm from its holster. As he sits back in his chair...

            If something happened, my reaction would

Evelyn doesn't see it, but Creasy does. Jordan just lets
his fingers trace the top of Lisa's ass.

As she and Evelyn head for the car, Creasy is there to
open the door.

Creasy gets behind the wheel. Pulls into traffic. As he

Loud. Chaotic. Reminiscent     of a lunatic asylum. Creasy
arrives at the public pool.    A practice. Several
bodyguards gather at one end   of the pool. Give Creasy a
less than friendly look. As    he looks for Pinta...

splash into the water.

He sees Pinta in the pool. The fifty yard dash. She's
in fifth. Then fourth. Creasy walks along beside her.
Third. Second and closing. And at the wall, still
second.

She surfaces, frustrated.    As she sees Creasy there...

Creasy drives. Pinta in back, writing in her notebook.
Not speaking, but a weird sort of harmony. Finally.

Underwater as Pinta swims. As she spins, kicks off the
wall, it's Creasy who comes out the other side. A plume

This is done over and over, faster and faster, closer and
closer. The blood becomes darker, bigger. And we push
into that blood until it's finally obscuring everything.

An elderly couple eating lunch. The HUSBAND looks over

     his boss helping feed and manicure him.  These are the TWO MEN

Now, John, you've got to wear clothes in proportion 
to your physique. There are definite do's and don'ts, good

The door to the office opens and he waves in DETECTIVE DONALD 
KIMBALL. KIMBALL is surprisingly young - about Bateman's age - 
and good-looking, dressed in a crumpled linen Armani suit of 
the type Bateman and his friends might wear.

Kimball sits down and crosses his legs with a 
self-assurance that makes Bateman so nervous he forgets to 
carry on with his fake conversation. Kimball looks up at 
him curiously, noticing the silence.

Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.

          topless waitresses while other topless waitresses slide
          down a big brass pole in the centre of the room. As the
          scene begins Barney is alone, morosely munching a corned
          beef sandwich. Now Archie appears, threading his way
          through topless fashion show. A topless ANNOUNCER is
          doing the fashion commentary into a chrome microphone,
          as the topless models majestically move about.

          liquid which instantly dries a violent blue and then very
          quickly starts changing into all the colors of the rainbow.
          These various colors indicate physical conditions. They

	 Tell me this. Do they have
	 auditions for television?

			ADDISON
	 That's all television is, my dear.
	 Nothing but auditions. 

He takes her toward the street. 

INT. THEATER - CURRAN THEATER - DAY

The curtain is up; the set, covered, is a bedroom in a
deteriorating Southern mansion. 

There is no one in the theater but Max, seated on the aisle
about two-thirds down, and Eve with Lloyd and Bill on the
stage. She is seated; they stand between her and auditorium.
There is some ad lib talk among the three which we cannot
make out. Margo marches down the aisle with a steady pace. 

She passes Max smiles a sickly, hopeful smile. She ignores
him as if he were a used paper cup. She disappears through
the door which leads backstage. 

Max whistles. Lloyd turns. Max indicated the door and puts
his hands to his head in despair. 

Margo walks out of the wings on stage. Bill and Lloyd turn to
her. Eve rises. 

			MARGO
		(cheerily)
	 Terribly sorry I'm late, lunch was
	 long and I couldn't find a cab -
	 where's Miss Caswell, shall we
	 start? Oh, hello, Eve...

			EVE
	 Hello, Miss Channing. 

			MARGO
	 How are you making out in Mr.
	 Fabian's office?
		(over the footlights to
		 Max)
	 I don't want you working the child
	 too hard, Max - just because you
	 promised. As you see, I kept my
	 promise, too...

Max slumps in his seat. By the time Margo turns back to them,
the others have exchanged swift looks. 

			BILL 
	 It's all over. 

			MARGO
	 What's all over?

She closes the door. He leans back, lights a cigarette. 

EXT. 52ND STREET - NEW YORK - NIGHT

A cab drives up to "21."

			KAREN'S VOICE
	 Some of the morning papers carried
	 a little squib about Eve's
	 performance. Not much, but full
	 praise...
	 I couldn't imagine how they found
	 out about it - but Lloyd said Max's
	 publicity man probably sent out the
	 story...

Karen gets out of the cab, pays and goes in. 

			KAREN'S VOICE
	 ... at any rate, I feel terribly
	 guilty and ashamed of myself - and
	 wanted nothing so much as to forget
	 the whole thing. Margo and I were
	 having lunch at "21" - just like
	 girlfriends - with hats on...

INT. LOBBY - "21" - DAY

Karen consults her watch and the doorman as she enters. 

			KAREN
	 Has Miss Channing come in?

			DOORMAN
	 Not yet, Mrs. Richards...

Karen sees Eve who waits as Addison hands his hat, coat, and
cane to an attendant. She smiles, crosses to her.

			KAREN
	 Eve. I've heard the most wonderful
	 things about your performance-

Title: All About Eve
Genres:
Drama, 
			EVE
	 Nothing definite yet - it's just to
	 have lunch. 

			ADDISON
	 They'll be wasting this much of
	 their time at any rate. Eve has no
	 intention of going to Hollywood. 

He turns to Karen, changing the subject. 

			ADDISON
	 From the smartness of your dress, I
	 take it your luncheon companion is
	 a lady?

			KAREN
		(smiles)
	 Margo. 

			ADDISON
	 Margo? Lunching in public?

			KAREN
	 It's new Margo. But she's just as
	 late as the old one. 

			ADDISON
	 She may be later than you think...

As he speaks, he crosses to pick up an evening paper, opens
it as he comes back. 

			ADDISON
		(handing it to her)
	 Why not read my column to pass the
	 time? The minutes will fly like
	 hours...
		(he takes Eve's arm)
	 ... and now we must join our
	 sunburned eager beaver. 

He goes up the stairs with Eve. Karen glances after them
curiously, then at the column.
It is headed: "Things I Promised Not To Tell" by Addison
deWitt. He expression becomes increasingly horrified. She
drops the paper and rushes out...

INT. MARGO'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Addison's column quivers in Margo's hand as she strides about
reading it. Karen sits miserably. 

Title: All About Eve

			BILL 
		(quietly)
	 I came as soon as I read that piece
	 of filth. I ran all the way...

Margo suddenly starts to cry. She turns from him. Bill takes
her in his arms. He holds her...

			BILL 
	 Bill's here, baby. Everything's all
	 right, now...

Margo says nothing, just hides in his embrace. He soothes
her, pets her... he looks over at Karen. 

			KAREN
	 I guess at this point I'm what the
	 French call 'de trop'...

			BILL 
		(smiles)
	 Maybe just a little around the
	 edges.

Karen smiles back, waves, and goes out. 

INT. RICHARDS' APARTMENT - DAY

Karen's having some lunch. Lloyd, still in his robe, sits
opposite her having some coffee and a cigarette. A copy of
the interview before him. 

			LLOYD
		(is saying)
	 - it's Addison, from start to
	 finish, it drips with his brand of
	 venom... taking advantage of a kid
	 like that, twisting her words,
	 making her say what he wanted her
	 to say-

			KAREN
	 Where'd you get all that
	 information?

			LLOYD
		(put out his cigarette)
	 Eve. 

			KAREN
	 Eve?

	 me, haven't you? We'll I'll give
	 you some pleasant news. I've been
	 told off in no uncertain terms all
	 over town. Miss Channing should be
	 happy to hear that. To know how
	 loyal her friends are - how much
	 more loyal they are than she had a
	 right to expect me to be...

She turns away from Karen. Karen's embarrassed. 

			KAREN
	 Eve... don't cry. 

			EVE
		(turned away)
	 I'm not crying.

			KAREN
	 Tell me. How did your lunch turn
	 out - with the man from Hollywood? 

			EVE
	 Some vague promises of a test,
	 that's all - if a particular part
	 should come along, one of those
	 things-

			KAREN
	 But the raves about your
	 performance-

			EVE
	 - an understudy's performance. 

			KAREN
	 Well. I think you're painting the
	 picture a little darker than it is,
	 really. If nothing else - and don't
	 underestimate him - you have a
	 powerful friend in Addison. 

Title: All About Eve
Genres:

			EVE
	 That's not true!

			ADDISON
	 I was there, I saw you and heard
	 you through the dressing room door!

Eve turns face down again, sobbing miserably.

			ADDISON
	 You used my name and my column to
	 blackmail Karen into getting you
	 the part of "Cora" - and you lied
	 to me about it!

			EVE
		(into the bed)
	 No-no-no...

			ADDISON
	 I had lunch with Karen not three
	 hours ago. As always with women who
	 want to find out things, she told
	 more than she learned...
		(he lets go of her hands)
	 ... do you want to change your
	 story about Lloyd beating at your
	 door the other night?

Eve covers her face with her hands. 

			EVE
	 Please... please...

Addison get off the bed, looks down at her. 

			ADDISON
	 That I should want you at all
	 suddenly strikes me as the height
	 of improbability. But that, in
	 itself, is probably the reason.
	 You're an improbable person, Eve,
	 and so am I. We have that in
	 common. Also a contempt for
	 humanity, an inability to love or
	 be loved, insatiable ambition - and
	 talent. We deserve each other. Are
	 you listening to me?

Eve lies listlessly now, her tear-stained cheek against the
coverlet. She nods.

			ADDISON
	 Then say so. 

			EVE
	 Yes, Addison.

Ola then gets into his car and drives off.  Michael walks up
the walkway and enters the little house, closing the door
behind him.

This woman, TERRI ROTH, is in the kitchen, looking out at
Michael.

				TERRI
		I'm just going to make lunch.  How

				MICHAEL
		Thank you, Mrs. Roth.

She hurries halfway up the staircase.

		Hyman...HYMAN, your friend is here.

		Why don't you go right upstairs, Mr.

				MICHAEL
		Fine.

He continues upstairs; she goes into the kitchen.

				TERRI
		I'll give a yell when lunch is ready.

Michael continues up to a small den on the second floor; we
can HEAR the sound of a baseball game coming over the
television.

INT. HYMAN ROTH'S DEN - DAY

Michael enters the den: it's very comfortable, but somewhat
like a senior citizen's retirement home in Florida.

MICHAEL'S VIEW

There, sitting before the television is a small man in his
middle sixties, thin, with a wizened face, looking like a
small-time retired Jewish businessman.  This is HYMAN ROTH.

				ROTH
		Sit down, this is almost over.  You

		Not for a few years.

EXT. HAVANA STREET - DAY

A street singer, followed by a guitarist sings Jose Marti's
words of "Guantanamera." It is solemn, as though it is a
song of protest, a song of the revolution.

Nearby, in a restaurant, Michael has lunch with Fredo.

Michael sits at a table having a sparse lunch.  He is
attended by his sister Connie, who seems to be the closest
person now living on the estate with him.  We see from the
way she pampers him with his lunch, that she has fallen into
the role of a surrogate Mother-Wife.  He seems older than
his years, as though his illness, diabetes, has taken its
toll.

				CONNIE
		Don't worry; I'm sure he got here

She picks up some of the serving plates that he has left
untouched.

          from his briefcase. It's a bad print - the kind someone takes

You're off your head.

JENNY
(pleased, showing off)
You can wait on me a minute. Or I'll see you back in the Points if you're
scared.
(Amsterdam looks at her)
Don't worry. I know every house on this street. They all leave their doors
open. They live like they're not in New York.

She GOES IN the house. Amsterdam WATCHES through the window, sees her
going up stairs. Then he looks at the dining room, visible distantly
through an open kitchen door.

He WATCHES, fascinated, fragments of the everyday rituals of a world he's
never seen. As SOUNDS drift listlessly from the street beyond, and a light
BREEZE blows, WE SEE IN A SERIES OF DISSOLVES the serving of a meal;
SERVANTS carrying and passing plates; FAMILY MEMBERS reaching for dishes
and passing them; the LOW KURMUR of Konversation in accents he has never
heard. It's not so much that these people and their life are foreign to
him. It is as if he has stepped into another Dimension.

He loses his sense of time, and of danger. So that when Jenny TOUCHES his
arm she surprises him thoroughly.

          it, trying to avoid stepping into the Limestone dust with his
          polished shoes, but the dust is everywhere.

          Several CUTTERS are having lunch. They are eating heartily
          right outside the shop. The NOISE is EVEN LOUDER but they
          don't seem to be bothered by it. One of them looks.

                         CUTTER ONE
          Well, look who's back.
          He has to shout to be heard. The others look.

          ANGLE ON MR. BLASE
          He's glad to be back but he's also trying to keep a little
          distance as if proud of how far he had come in life. He
          smiles and waves grandly, his suit and tie sticking out in
          this surrounding.

          No, a Union Organizer.
          They all laugh and get up to greet him. All except one
          younger man who continues sitting and eating. The Cutters
          slap Mr. Blase on the back, their dusty hands leaving dusty
          imprints on his jacket.

          come back I could pick up where
          I left off.
          The entrance to the shop draws him forward. A couple of the
          Cutters accompany him. He takes half of a sandwich from one
          of them. It's lunch hour at the shop and the old instincts
          are coming back.

                         YOUNG CUTTER
          Who's he?
          Mr. Blase looks back over his shoulder hurt by this remark.

          I . SHOP DAY
          The NOISE is now DEAFENING. Dust is everywhere and slowly
          through the dust we see men working, pausing only long enough
          to smile and wave at Mr. Blase. Mr. Blase is finishing off
          his sandwich just like the Cutter next to him who walks to
          his place leaving Mr. Blase, who has no place here, to wonder.

          his lunch. There's nowhere to hide from the rain so he's
          getting wet. He looks tired. He's thinking of the Italians.
          As he turns his legs we see: THE PICTURE OF THE ITALIANS

          FROM THE COMPETITIVE CYCLING MAGAZINE: FOUR OF THEM, ARMS
          AROUND EACH OTHER, SMILING. Then we see another picture,
          Dave is in the middle of the Italians. He has his arms
          around them. He's smiling just like they are.

          She is flummoxed.

                          MARGARET
           What masterpiece?

                          WALTER
           Exactly! What have I been missing all
           this time?! Da Vinci has his Mona
           Lisa... Renoir has his Boatmen's
           Lunch... but where's my defining
           statement?

                          MARGARET
           You sound insane. Artists don't
           announce a masterpiece --

                          WALTER
           Why not?! Didn't Michelangelo know he
           was hittin' a homer, when he was on
           his back painting the Sistine Chapel?

                          MARGARET
           He worked on that for FOUR YEARS!

          Below, two tiny figures walk in: Canaday and an obtuse CIVIC

                          TJ
           I don't know. Can you ask me when I

          The lunch yard is busy. The crowd clears a moment and we find TJ
          sitting on a bench in the shade, alone and depressed, hidden
          away from the other kids.

      Mackelway sits at a table by a window. Watching. FIFTY MASSIVE
      TRUCKS in this lot - some refrigerated, most not.

      This Diner is big enough to seat 200: truckers, a few
      families, and folks who just like the buffet, (gravy covers
      just about every entree.)

      Mackelway's been here for hours. A WAITRESS comes by.

                 You want some more breakfast, Honey, or

                 Meatloaf's lookin' good today.

      He smiles, thanks. She turns away. That leaves him alone
      again, scanning - not even sure he's in the right place.

      CEL-PHONE RINGS. He grabs it.

          wooden headsets...a roar of buzzers, bells, circuits opening
          and closing, and a hundred female operators speaking at once.
          
          Supervisors on skates roll up and down the narrow lanes created
          by the banks of switching stations, going from one operator
          to another as needed. Christine is one of them. She turns
          at the SOUND of a bell struck twice, then rolls down the lane
          toward an OPERATOR frantically waving a pink sheet of paper.

                         I've met Mrs. Mitchell in Washington, 
                         I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and 
                         tell her--

               And the phone clicks dead--

               AN ELEVATOR, the numbers of the floors being lit as it rises. 
               4--5--6-- WOODWARD stands alone in the elevator. As it reaches 
               seven and the doors slide open, he steps out and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE MARRIOTT SUITE. It's numbered 710. WOODWARD approaches 
               but as he does the door begins to open so he whirls, knocks 
               on the door nearest him. Now 710 is wide open and several 
               maids leave, watched by a large black man.

                                     FIRST MAID
                         We'll be back after lunch.

                                     BLACK MAN
                              (it's the voice from 
                              the phone)
                         We'll be here.

               WOODWARD waits by his door as 710 slowly closes. The maids 
               look at him a moment. He knocks again, louder.

                                     SECOND MAID
                         I think they went out.

                                     WOODWARD

                         I don't mind waiting.

               The maids nod, move out of sight. WOODWARD stands tense and 
               still, watching the closed door numbered 710... Now--

     Norah smiles self consciously. She's flustered. Not a
     familiar sensation. The doors open to the "Albuquerque Blood
     Services."

                         LYNN

     Norah pulls the photos from her bag and sets them on a shelf
     next to the candy heart. Then, she drops to the floor and
     pulls the LUNCH BOX from under her bed.

     She surveys the contents: lipstick tipped cigarette butts, an
     eyelash curler, a Blue Jay feather, an old photo.

     In the photo two girls, twelve and five, stand with their
     mom. A cigarette dangles from the mother's ruby red mouth.

     Rose lies in bed and listens to cars go by on the highway.
     She checks her watch, picks up the phone and dials.

                         ROSE
               Hi. Could you tell me what time you
               have? Okay. Thanks.

     Rose hangs up and falls back onto the bed, feet dangling off
     the edge. She stares at the ceiling and whispers.

                  to lunch at the Howard Johnson's.
                  They have such nice rolls there.

     Rose hands Norah the key and motions for her to go ahead.

                  Would you like to sit for a moment,

                            MRS. DAVIS
                  Yes dear, I think I would.

     Rose sits down on the steps with Mrs. Davis and Norah quietly
     enters the house.

     From the van Oscar watches Rose and the old woman sit side by
     side on the front step. Rose's hand rests lightly on the
     woman's bony shoulder. Words seem useless.

     Norah looks around the room furnished modestly with a mixture
     of antiques and things that are simply old.

     Yellow sticky notes cling to doors, walls, light switches,
     etc. Each note contains a simple instruction such as `turn
     off light' or `watch news at 6:00'.

     Norah walks past family photos that line the hall.

     side next to a blood-soaked rug. Golden sunlight pours
     through the windows.

INT. JANIE DALE'S PENTHOUSE

It is a very small penthouse. KLUTE &amp; BREE stand in
the small living room waiting for JANIE DALE. There
are two very casually dressed prostitutes sitting
around the living room. One sits at an upright
piano playing of all things STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT.
Another one sits on a couch talking to a Wall
Street Broker who is spending his lunch hour. KLUTE
finds himself staring down into a pile of
pornography magazines on the coffee table. BREE is
amused at his discomfort.
JANIE DALE, the madame, who has been on the phone
in the back, puts the receiver down and crosses to
the girl on the couch. JANIE looks and talks a bit
like Lauren Bacall.

	It's old Mr. Clean from Cleveland.
	He wants to know when he can fly in
	and clean up the apartment and see

	come anytime, but it's up to you.

She shrugs and turns to KLUTE &amp; BREE.

          "WHIT," 50s, is Hitchcock's physical opposite -- dashing,
          razor-sharp and sophisticated. In fact he'd be at home in one
          of his movies.
                         
                          WHITFIELD COOK
           ... Thank God I had a pocketful of
           pretzels. I was hiding in that props
           cupboard all night.
                          (THEN)

           Hitch always said your private life was
           in danger of being more entertaining than
           any of your plots.

INT. BRUNO'S COMPARTMENT ON TRAIN (PROCESS)

Bruno and Guy are finishing lunch. Bruno has been drinking
and his eyes are bright and feverish. An almost empty liquor
bottle is near a couple of detective novels covered with
gaudily Illustrated dust jackets. Bruno has in unlighted
cigarette in his mouth. Guy's lighter is on the table.
Bruno snaps it a couple of times, as though fascinated, lights
his cigarette and puts the lighter on the table again.

                      BRUNO
          Sure, I went to college. Three of
          them. Every time they kicked me out
          my father threw me back in.
              (bitterly)
          He finally gave up. He thinks I'm
          awfully small fry, not worth the
          bait.
              (wistfully)
          You my friend, Guy?

                       GUY
          Sure.   I'm your friend, Bruno.

                      BRUNO
              (a little woozy)
          No, you're not, nobody thinks I'm
          anything special. Only my mother.
              (empties the bottle
               into his glass)
          My father hates me.

Guy smiles this off as nonsense.

                      GUY
          You must be imagining things.

          the lamb chops were a little overdone

Bruno comes up to Anne and the Senator. He gives a slight
bow to the Senator; then puts his hand out to Anne.

                        BRUNO
            Good evening, Miss Burton.

The Senator looks inquiringly.    Anne makes the introduction.

                        ANNE
            This is Mr. Antony, father.

            How do you do, sir.

                        BRUNO
            I'd like to talk to you sometime,
            Senator, about my idea of harnessing
            the life force. It will make atomic
            power look like the horse and buggy.
                (the Senator and Anne
                 are beginning to
                 look at him in
                 amazement)
            I'm already developing my faculty
            for seeing millions of miles. And,
            Senator, can you imagine being able
            to smell a flower on the planet of
            Mars? I'd like to lunch with you
            some day soon and tell you more about
            it.

Interrupted by new arrivals, Bruno moves away out of the
picture, with a charming smile to Anne.

The Senator greets the new guests with open mouth and simply
shakes their hands while glancing off in direction of the
departing Bruno.

She realizes he hasn't heard a word she's said and haughtily
moves on. The Senator turns to Anne.

            I called Betsy again at her office,
            and she said maybe we could go to a
            movie together after she gets off
            work tomorrow. That's my day off.
            At first she hesitated, but I
            called her again and she agreed.
                   (pause)
            Betsy. Betsy what? I forgot to ask
            her last name again.  Damn. I've
            got to remember stuff like that.

Travis checks the mirror. Scanning across the back seat, he
recognizes the middle passenger. It is CHARLES PALANTINE,
candidate for President.  He must have left the Hotel
shortly after BETSY.

Tom, seated on the jump seat, checks his watch and speaks
deferentially to Palantine:

                         TOM
            It's 12:30 now. You'll have fifteen
            minutes before the actual luncheon
            begins.

Palantine nods as his assistant picks up the thread of an
earlier conversation.

EAST SIDE COFFEE SHOP.  It is about 1:30 P.M.

IRIS is dressed more sensibly, wearing jeans and a maroon
sweater.  Her face is freshly washed and her hair combed out.

Seen this way, IRIS looks no different than any young girl
in the big city.  OTHER PATRONS of the coffee shop most
likely assume she is having lunch with her big brother.

They are both having an All-American breakfast: ham and
eggs, large glasses of orange juice, coffee.

Outside here environment, Iris seems the more pathetic.  She
seems unsure, schizy, unable to hold a subject for more than
thirty seconds.  Her gestures are too broad, her voice too
mannered.  We sympathize with Travis' paternal respect.

                      You keep too much to yourself --
                      you're a lone wolf.  It makes me
                      uneasy, and if it makes me uneasy
                      I can't imagine the impression you
                      make on lesser employees.

        The Chief Clerk, towering over him, also reminds Kafka of his
        father.  Kafka tries putting up a defense.

                      It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for
                      you and not for your workmates.  At
                      the annual dinner this month you
                      again failed to make an appearance.

                      more responsible positions while you,

Jennie picks up the phone and puts it to her ear. She searches her pockets for a quarter and comes up empty. She begins shaking her hands back and forth.

JENNIE
Ruby. Do you have a quarter?

Ruby hands her a quarter. Jennie dials her house.

Peter, is Mom there? No, I need to speak to Mommy... Peter where's Mommy? No, I can't talk to you right now. Yeah... I hear it... look just tell her... No never mind... Go watch television.

She hangs up the phone and starts to cry. Ruby puts her arm around Jennie.

RUBY
Shh. Come on, it's gonna be OK.

JENNIE
That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.

RUBY
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.

JENNIE

A man with a beeper walks up and taps on the phone booth.

So, this freaked the hell out of Casper. He was just a little kid and he wasn't sure what to do.

Casper moves off the step and runs into the kitchen.

TELLY (V.O.)
So he ran and got a big knife. The same knife his pops used to cut the turkey on Thanksgiving with.

He opens a drawer full of silverware and pulls out a humongous glistening knife. He picks it up, and it shines on his face.

As his mother screams he looks up at the ceiling with the knife in his hand.

CASPER'S MOM
(screaming from upstairs)
Stop! Please stop! Oooh help!

Casper runs up the stairs, he is holding the knife straight out.

Tony, a ranger, drives along a dirt road past the Fakahatchee
Strand State Preserve sign and enters the swamp. He sees the
white van and Ford parked ahead, spots a Seminole license
plate on the Ford. He pulls over down the road, and whispers
into his C.B.

No response. Tony glowers, gets out of the truck, watches
the vehicles through binoculars. Nothing. He straightens
his cap. Mosquitoes land on his neck, his nose, his lips.

 Theodore sits at the table reading a physics book. He picks
 up his earpiece to call Samantha.

               (laughing at himself)
           Samantha, this physics book is
           really dense. I'm halfway through
           half of the first chapter. It's
           making my brain hurt.
               (beat)
           Hello, Samantha? Hello?

 He looks down at his device, sees a message: Operating System
 Not Found. Confused, he waits, tries again: Operating System
 Not Found. Anxious, he runs to his office computer. He gets
 the same message: Operating System Not Found. He starts
 trying to connect to Samantha on both the phone and computer,
 but no luck. He starts to panic, sits for a beat, looks
 around, then stands and hurries out of the office. In the
 elevator he frantically tries his device with no luck.

 Theodore runs out of the building. He keeps trying Samantha,

                 Meet me in the chapel at eight-thirty,
                 right before lock-down.

     INT. MESS HALL - LUNCH

     As Foley takes his tray up the centre aisle, he scans the sea
     of white T-shirts until he sees the two little Latins sitting
     at a table full of other little Latins.  CHINO -- fifties, in
     shape -- shovels macaroni in his mouth.

     Chino's "wife", LULU, nineteen, looks up from his own neat tray
     of macaroni and jello and watches Foley walk past and sit down
     with a bunch of bikers.

     Foley watches as the guy across from Chino scrapes some macaroni
     off his plate and on to Chino's and Chino wolfs that down, too.

     EXT. MESS - DAY

     Chino steps outside and lights a cigarette.  He puts an arm
     around Lulu, starts to walk off...

                              FOLEY (OS)
                 Today's the day, huh?

     Chino looks over, watches Foley approach, lets his arm slip
     down so he can hook his thumb into Lulu's belt... the next
     thing to having him on a leash.

                              FOLEY
                 You excited?

                              CHINO
                 I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.

                         MICK
          Why would he need protection?

                         MARY WINDSOR
          Because realtors alone in a house

      In a WIDE SHOT, we see a vast field, bordered by green
      mountains. Unseen BIRDS call out from the trees, while
      insects CLICK and WHIRR.

      In the distance, we spot swatches of bright colors moving our
      way. It's a family: father GABRIEL (34), wife MARY (33) and
      daughter NOELLE (8). They're returning from a short day
      hike. Mary carries a small videocamera.

      Seeing that Noelle is already a ways down the path...

                 Noelle!   Don't get too far ahead.

            You know -- I get the feeling you
            could use a nap.  There's a rest

            A nap won't help.  I've been awake

            Okay.  Here's how it is.  What goes
            into my book, as of noon, is that I
            apprehended you... for driving too
            fast, and advised you to proceed no
            further than the next rest area...
            your stated destination, right?
            Where you plan to take a long nap.
            Do I make myself clear?

            How far is Baker?  I was hoping to
            stop there for lunch.

                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
            Not my jurisdiction.  The city
            limits are two point two miles
            beyond the rest area.  Can you make
            it that far?

                         DUKE
            I'll try.  I've been wanting to go
            to Baker for a long time.  I've
            heard a lot about it.

               Well Brian, it doesn't sound like
               you're doing any business...

               I think it's okay for a guy to be a
               virgin...

     Bender looks suprised.

                            BRIAN
               You do?

     Claire smiles and nods.

     Everybody has lunches now.

     Claire begins to take hers out of a small shopping bag.

               What's in there?

     Bender grabs a Coke and tosses it over to Allison who
     catches it without even looking up.

     Bender then watches Claire set up a sushi platter.

     bag, a bag of potato chips, an apple, a banana, a bag
     of cookies and a carton of milk.

     Allison opens her Coke and it fizzes over.  She loudly

               What's your problem?

     Allison opens her sandwich and and tosses the meat up.
     It lands on the sculpture above.

     She opens some pixie stix and pours the sugar on the

          Gonna be visiting that all-woman's
          America's cup team in a few weeks --
          If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis
          O'Conner's days are numbered.  But
          they're in San Diego, so I thought
          I'd take a quick promenade of the
          base.

Deafening silence.  We aren't sure who dreads the idea
more -- the C.O. or Jordan.

                         C.O.
          Uh, V.I.P. security arrangements
          generally take some time, Senator.

          Then set out the good plates, we'll
          all have lunch.  My office will
          follow up with details.  Jumping
          off, now...

Phone goes dead.  The C.O. gives Jordan a look one might
reserve for a lab technician who inadvertently unleashed
Ebola upon the world.

          Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.

About to hug Jordan, DeHaven stops awkwardly.

                         JORDAN
          You know him.

                         DEHAVEN
          Sounds familiar.

                         JORDAN
          It should.  You nominated him for
          Spec-Recon just three days after you
          nominated me.

                         DEHAVEN
          Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch
          tomorrow?  I do very much want to
          talk, but now is scarcely --

                         JORDAN
          Did you set me up?  Did you set me
          up just to see me fail?

                         DEHAVEN
          Absolutely not.

DeHaven glances back at the doors to the Senate chamber --
the open doors.  Walking Jordan a few steps away:

                         DEHAVEN
          Wickwire was there to help.  To be
          my eyes on the inside, to make sure
          you were getting a fair shot.  At
          least that was the intent.

          What changed?

EXT.  GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

DeHaven.  She's holding a press conference, trying to turn
piss into wine -- and doing a pretty good job:

                         DEHAVEN
          ... of course, we always prefer
          peace to war.  But if we're going to
          war, give women a piece.  Give them
          the choice to defend their country.
          And if the President doesn't like
          that idea -- if he wants to continue
          to deny women their equal rights --
          then I'll be happy to step out back
          with him any time, anywhere...

Jordan approaches.  Spotting her, the PRESS PLEADS for a
photo-op with both women.

                         DEHAVEN
          Jordan?  Jordan, dear...

Letting silence be the ultimate expression of scorn,
Jordan walks right past DeHaven...

And joins Royce.  Together they turn and leave.

                         C.O.
          Senator, perhaps this would be a
          good time for that lunch.  Will the
          America's Cup team be joining us?

Jordan and Royce walk hand in hand, strolling the same
beach she trained on.

          So here we are again.  Staring three

          Look.  It's not like you'd be
          completely out of reach.  And maybe
          we could call in a few favors, get
          you stationed at Norfolk instead of
          Coronado.  There are ways of dealing
          with these things -- I mean, if
          people are so inclined.

               on the main drag of this small town which, oddly enough, is 
               also called Mumford. He comes inside and goes to the counter

               forty named LILY, who talks to him as she works.

                                                                     24.

                         

                         
          He launches a full-court shot, bangs it off the rim, and lets
          himself topple over backward. Lies staring at the ceiling.

          Jim sits over the wreckage of his lunch. He downs a margarita
          and puts the empty glass down beside several others.

                    we need the mirror of other faces to
                    see ourselves. The clamor of voices
                    in our ears to reassure us that we

               Amidst the crowd of Hotel guests in their pajamas, Charlotte

Chuck thinks about that.  After a moment, he grins.

          Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.

Chuck sits back on the couch, taking in the sight of the
ocean in the light rain.  He looks over at all the canvases,
the easel, the palettes.  The wind rustles the palm trees
around the house.  The surf crashes and rustles.  Familiar
sounds.  Island sounds.

He relaxes a little.  Maybe the package with the wings was a
sign, he kept it all these years precisely for this.  Then
there's a sound of a truck in the driveway.

The engine cuts off.  There are steps on the porch.  The door
opens.  A tanned muscular MAN in neatly kept work clothes
comes in, hangs a tool belt on a hook by the door.

He looks at Chuck with a relaxed, even stare, as if seeing a
man in a FedEx uniform sitting on his couch is not an unusual
occurrence.

                     MAN
          Hey.

The Man nods at Chuck, goes into the kitchen.  We are on
Chuck's face.  Who's this?  We hear muffled laughter from
inside.

EXT.  BEACH HOUSE - HOUR LATER

Arms around each other, the Man and the Woman say goodbye to
Chuck.  In the front yard is a panel truck painted with two
angel wings.  The Man grins at Chuck, an easy, friendly grin.

          inside there's a large fire and decorative horse drawings on
          the walls. The MAN instructs his SON to paint as the WOMAN
          teaches her DAUGHTER to sew. We see Greg positioning the
          fossil of a VELOCIRAPTOR next to the mother and daughter. The

               way things had happened lat-ely -

                            MA

               - lately, that Alice had begun to
               think that very few things indeed
               were really impossible.

     Ma comes to the table and doles out half-thawed green beans.

                            MA
               Lunch!

               No thanks.

               We have to use them up before they
               rot. Once we eat we'll feel warmer.

           Man, it's all gone so wrong, so fast.

           Max knocks on the door to Julie's suite. Nothing. He paces,
           frustrated. Suddenly, JUDY comes out of a stairwell.
                         
                          JUDY
           Hello? Can I help you?

Lorne Michaels squirms uncomfortably.  He chooses his words.

                    One day I'm reading a book at the
                    corner deli and this guy sits down
                    and starts asking about it. Now
                    he's my husband!
          
                              TOM
                    This is funny to you?

                    What would have happened if I went
                    to the movies instead? If I went
                    somewhere else for lunch? If I
                    showed up to eat ten minutes later?
                    Tom, it was meant to be, just like
                    you said. And as it was happening,
                    I knew it. I could feel it, sure as
                    the sun. And I kept thinking to
                    myself "Holy shit. Tom was right."
                    You were right about all of it.
                        (BEAT)
                    It just wasn't me you were right
                    about.
          
          Tom is speechless. Summer takes his hand. We may notice her
          wedding ring. We may also notice that this is the same exact
          shot as the first scene of the screenplay. We hold it for a
          few seconds more. And then, the hands separate.

                    Anyway, I should probably be
                    getting back. It was good to see

          Good evening, Your Honour.

                         GRAHAM
          Mrs Ainslie. I hope you had a
          good day. What did you get up
          to?

                         JEAN
          Well, I started in my bedroom,
          where I had a lovely couple of
          hours giving all the cockroaches
          names. Then after a lunch that
          will long have a place in my
          heartburn, I came out here
          and stared blindly at a book
          waiting for someone - anyone to
          rescue me. And how glad I am it
          was you.

                         GRAHAM
          Why would you not go out?
          There's so much to see.
          Jean had hoped for some appreciation of her wit, and is
          floored by his question. She can hardly understand, let
          alone tell him, the depths of her discomfort.

                         GRAHAM (CONT'D)
          Open your eyes, Mrs Ainslie. All
          life is here, I tell you.
          Jean stares at him. He goes on through the archway into
          the hotel. Then stops.

                         GRAHAM (CONT'D)
          I could talk to the chef, if you
          like. Perhaps get you some
          grilled chicken, plain rice.

                         JEAN
          I would appreciate that very
          much.
          Graham goes on in. Jean just sits there. Wishing he'd
          come back out again.

		Johana, am I boring you?

					JOHANA
		Sorry.  Of course not, definitely

PAOLO half-heartedly, hands him the key.  ENZO glances at
JACQUES to make sure he's properly impressed.  He throws
his arm around JACQUES' shoulder, hugs him and gives him a

They're at a table on a terrace that overlooks the sea.
They've just arrived and all around them people are
lunching away furiously.

ENZO beckons to a passing WAITER who comes to the table.
He's a very handsome, slightly effeminate young man.

			   (to waiter)
		"Spaghetti del mare"

		It's delicious here.  It's the one

		It must be hard to live in two

JACQUES nods without really knowing.

ENZO starts laughing.  JACQUES would like to crawl under
the table.

		Yes, of course.  Lots of questions.

JACQUES is satisfied with his answer.  He thinks that the

watches him.  Then:

                         Hey. Are you Joyce?

               Joyce turns around. The flesh and blood HARVEY PEKAR stands 
               before her -- not quite as bad as the Crumb version, not 
               quite as good as the Dumm version, but still acceptable. She 
               sighs with relief.

                                     JOYCE
                         Hi, Harvey. We finally meet in person.

               She politely offers her hand. Harvey shakes it, but he looks 
               overwhelmed, worried and pessimistic.

                                     HARVEY
                         Hiya. Look, before we get started 
                         with any of this, ya might as well 
                         know right off the bat. I had a 
                         vasectomy.

               Joyce lets go of his hand. She stares at him in disbelief.

               The most awkward date in history. Seated in an ultra-yuppie 
               restaurant filled with business lunchers, Harvey and Joyce 
               hide behind their menus. While everyone else looks slick and 
               successful, these two compete for the world's worst posture. 

                                     HARVEY

                         Not really. I find most American 
                         cities depressing in the same way.

               HARVEY approaches the building. Instead of dragging his feet 
               like usual, he seems to be floating on a cloud. We haven't 
               seen Harvey this happy since... well, since never.

               He stops by a junker car and peeks in the window, finding 
               TOBY eating lunch alone. He has an entire White Castle 
               smorgasbord spread across the front seat.

               Harvey knocks on the window. Toby rolls it down.

                                     HARVEY
                         Ay Toby.

                         No you can't have any of my White 
                         Castle hamburgers so please don't 
                         even ask.

                         Can I have a fry?

               Harvey reaches for a handful of Toby's fries.

                                     TOBY
                         Okay, but just a couple, Harvey. I'm 
                         not going to eat dinner until very 
                         late and this has got to hold me 
                         over.

               Harvey leans in, always amused by Toby. He steals another 
               fry.

               chomps on a knish and watches oddball New Yorkers stroll by 
               as Joyce nibbles on her hot dog.

               stares at him. He enters a room with a "DO NOT DISTURB" sign.

               Hilton.

               HARVEY tries on outfits for the big show. He pulls a wrinkled 
               T-shirt over his head and models it for JOYCE who is spread 
               out on the bed surrounded by piles of clothing, scissors and 
               sewing supplies. She glances up at Harvey's getup and shakes 
               her head no.

     Laura jams a pillow into a t-shirt as a makeshift pillowcase
     as she escorts one of the pier girls to the couch. The pier
     girl looks slightly unkempt and is relieved to plop her
     knapsack on the floor. Laura tosses the pillow onto the
     couch.

     book, now dog-eared and worn is on the table in front of her.

     She finds her place and copies notes and multiple choice

           They're expecting you, they're gonna
           give you your schedule. Here's your
           lunch money. I will pick you up
           right here at 3:30.

               INT. NEW YORK HOTEL RESTAURANT -DAY

               The restaurant fairly deserted after the lunch crowd. Empty 
               tables -- crisp linen, Laura alone at a table, watching the 
               door, an untouched cup of coffee in front of her.

               EXT. NEW YORK HOTEL - DAY

               The doorman opens the door of a cab.

               ANGLE

               Mickey Morrissey standing in an alcove under the marquee, 
               looking out at the street.

               ANGLE - P.O.V.

               The street. Pedestrians. Joe Galvin comes walking hurriedly, 
               smiling, down the street.

               ANGLE

               Mickey starting down the steps, intercepts Galvin. Galvin 
               looks up, surprised.

     A thin smile forms on Whale's face.

     EXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - DAY

     Clay prunes the roses on the front lawn.  Hanna appears,
     frowning.

                    The Master wants to know if you are
                    free for lunch.  I tell him you
                    will be having other plans, but he
                    insists I ask.

                    Yes.  I trust you.

     Off in the distance, a throat loudly trumpets itself clear.

                    You must go in.  Quickly.  He will
                    not like to think I have had you in

     Clay gets up slowly, reluctant to leave the room.

     Whale comes forward as Clay enters, offering a hand at the
     end of a spindly wrist.

     A hesitant smile from Clay.  Whale picks a stack of mail off
     the table, rifles through envelopes.

     He returns the stack to the table but holds on to a square

                         Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you 
                         have a big lunch?

                                     JUNO
                         It's not a food baby. I took three 
                         pregnancy tests today. I am definitely 
                         up the spout.

                         for three pregnancy tests?

                         I drank like ten tons of Sunny 
                         Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. 
                         And you're shockingly cavalier.

	THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE.

	David's sister, Jennifer, hangs out with her friends in the
	parking lot. All the girls are dressed in the exact same
	uniform: Blue jeans, beeper on the belt, white V-neck T
	shirt, car keys in their hand. (Even the girls WITHOUT a car
	hold car keys in their hand). Jennifer is by far the
	prettiest and, thus, is the leader of the group. They all
	look toward the Luncheon Court where David and his friends
	are hanging out.

	A group of VERY HIP boys strut through the parking lot. They
	bop up and down with the self-confidence of all cool sixteen
	year olds. The girls freeze when they see them.

     SERENA eyes ANDY with disbelief.

                          EMILY (CONT'D)
                I told you.

                          SERENA
                I thought you were kidding.

                          EMILY
                Oh, no. I was quite serious.

     EMILY turns to ANDY.

                I get twenty minutes for lunch, you
                get fifteen. When I come back, you can
                go.

     As ANDY watches EMILY and SERENA'S thin hips as they move
     down the hall, talking about how absurd ANDY looks.

     A pasta bar. Deserted.

     A pizza station. Not a soul.

     A salad bar. Girls crowd the lettuce area, though no one's
     within a mile of the dressing region.

     ANDY races over to the deserted soup station. Quickly ladles
     some corn chowder into a bowl. NIGEL walks by with his tray.

                          NIGEL
                Corn chowder. Interesting choice.

     ANDY looks at him, confused.

                          NIGEL (CONT'D)
                You do know that cellulite is one of
                the ingredients of corn chowder.

     They walk over to the register, which has a long line. A few
     GIRLS are openly gaping, amazed that ANDY selected chowder.

                          ANDY
                None of the girls here eat anything?

                 You know, I rarely say this to people
                 who aren't me, but you need to calm
                 down.

      ANDY ignores her, racing around getting the dishes and
      silverware for MIRANDA'S steak.

      We see the steak, prettily arranged on MIRANDA'S china. ANDY
      sets up the salt and pepper. MIRANDA walks in. When MIRANDA
      sees the steak, she freezes.

                           MIRANDA
                 What is that doing here? I ordered it
                 ages ago.

      ANDY looks confused. Ages?

                           MIRANDA (CONT'D)
                 Luckily, before I starved to death,
                 Irv invited me to lunch.
                     (re: steak)
                 Get rid of that. I'll be back at 3.
                 Please have my Starbucks order
                 waiting.

      ANDY carries a tray with all the food on it into the kitchen.

      A beat. She looks down at the tray. And suppresses an urge to
      throw the whole thing at the wall.

      She positions the tray over the garbage and tilts it, letting
      everything -- steak, china, silverware -- fall into the can.
                                                                    63.

      ANDY walks in, cheerful, carrying a seating chart. She is
      surprised to see MIRANDA just sitting on the sofa.

      There's a strange lag before she looks up at ANDY. ANDY
      registers something is odd. Finally--

                             MIRANDA
                       (distracted)
                   There you are. We need to go over the
                   seating chart for the luncheon.

      ANDY starts to take the chart out of her bag, but she can't
      help but notice MIRANDA is... staring into space.

                             ANDY
                   Sure. No problem. I have it right
                   here, um...

      And finally MIRANDA focuses on her.

               EXT. SCHOOL YARD - LUNCH RECESS - DAY

               Roberta enters the yard from inside the school. It's filled 
               with kids playing, including Nick and Lexi. She waves to 
               them and Lexi runs up to her, carrying a piece of artwork.

                                     LEXI
                         Look what I made you, Mommy!

               He gives her a tempera PAINTING of a man's face, the 
               background decorated with glued-on macaroni. It says DADDY.

                              (covering her 
                              discomfort)
                         That is so beautiful!

               He runs off. Roberta exhales, sits down alone on a bench and 
               takes out her lunch. She smiles at ALICE CROWLEY and another 
               TEACHER but they cross to another bench. ISABEL VASQUEZ (25) 
               approaches, a lively Puerto Rican woman with a strong New 
               York accent.

                                     ISABEL

                         I'll take my chances.

               She sits down beside Roberta, takes out her lunch.

                         Is it my imagination, or does everyone 
                         hate me?

                         It's hard to fit in when you're doing 
                         a special program. People figure 
                         you're not gonna be here very long, 
                         so why make the effort?

                         It may take a while for folks to 
                         warm up, but nobody hates you.

                         A) she thinks the violin's a waste 
                         of time... and B) -- she's a bitch.

               Roberta laughs.

	and a teenage boy playing one of the pinball machines. Two 
	ladies in housedresses, with their hair in curlers, are 
	sitting at one of the booths, having coffee. The rear wall

	bay and the parking area below. A television set over the 
	bar is going. The shots and horsehoof beats of an old Western 
	movie should be HEARD muted throughout following.  DEKE 
	CARTER, who owns the restaurant with his wife, alternates

	Western. He looks up immediately when Mitch and Melanie ENTER.
