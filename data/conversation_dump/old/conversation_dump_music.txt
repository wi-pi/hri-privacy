                              (as she dials)
                         I remember when I first started 
                         reading these I thought DWF stood 
                         for "dwarf!"

                              (pause)
                         We hear the indistinct traces of a

                         BEEP.

                         Hi, it's me - your "striking blonde." 
                         Of course I remember you.  Let's get 
                         together for lunch sometime... How 
                         about Friday at one o'clock?... Why 
                         don't you meet me at my favorite 
                         restaurant, "Wowsville"... It's in 
                         the mall on Century Parkway... I'll 
                         see you there, darling... and be 
                         sure to wear that sexy green 
                         cardigan...

               As Enid hangs up they both start laughing.

                         almost done.

               Enid looks at herself in the security mirror. She takes off 
               her hat and messes up her hair. She then takes off her shades 
               and replaces them with her standard horn-rims.

                         So Josh, will you give us a ride?  
                         Please? Pretty please? It's going to 
                         be super fun!

               Enid glances at Rebecca and mouths the implausible name: 
               "Seymour?!" Rebecca snorts, unable to control her laughter, 
               and turns away from the table. Enid keeps her cool...

                         I don't have anything after about 
                         1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from 
                         the twenties in my collection, but 
                         it's not really for sale. I don't 
                         really collect "foreign."

               Enid drifts over and begins thumbing through a box of 78s.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Those are all 78s... Can you play 
                         78s?

                                     ENID
                         Sure!... Wait, maybe not 78s, but I 
                         can play regular records...

               He points her to a nearby box of LPs.

                         There's some good stuff in here... 
                         do you like old music?

                         here that re-issue some really great 
                         old blues stuff.

               Rebecca tugs on Enid's sleeve. Enid gets free and continues 
               looking through the records. She stops on one with an 
               especially wacky cover.

                                     ENID
                         Is this one any good?

                         Nah, it's not so great. Here's the 
                         one I'd recommend.

               He pulls out a bland-looking record: "COLLECTOR'S ITEMS, 
               VOLUME THREE." Rebecca shifts impatiently behind her.

                         A PICTURE
          Several people are seated amongst dozens of presents
          laughing. A. seven year old Large stands with his arm around
          a seven year old Cynthia. They both wear enormous "chicken-
          foot" slippers and smile from ear to ear.
          Large's POV: zooms into the face of the only person in the
          photo not smiling. This is Sarah Largeman. She stands; not
          yet requiring a wheelchair.
          He crosses to the bed and sits down. The surface sends waves
          ,towards the pillows throwing them off the bed, revealing it's

                         A WATERBED-
          A LOUD RING from a PHONE on the bedside table which appears
          to be made out of Legos. He answers it.

          Hello?... Hey. No... Yes.

          INT. THE GARAGE - NIGHT

          Large pulls away a tarp to reveal a classic world War II Army
          motorcycle with a sidecar. The corner of hie mouth raises and
          holds the idea of a smile.

          Large flies through the suburban sprawl without a helmet. THE

          MUSIC BLASTS.
          The wind throws his hair back as Large whips through the back
          roads. He's going really fast. He closes his eyes, flying by
          a COP CAR doing eighty before he opens them again. LIGHTS
          FLASH behind him as he pulls over.

                         LARGE
          Fuck.
          The cop car stops behind him and blares him with the search

          A bunch of people are gathered around Mark as he tells a

          Everyone looks to Large at the end of the line.

          Mark sloppily hugs Large. Others slap him five as Large
          awkwardly navigates between variations of hugs and
          handshakes.

          First let's finish Daddy's golf

          The group loves this idea- As they laugh and party the CAIa.ERA
          FINDS ITS WAY to Large's face as he feels the weed and the
          beginning of his trip. His eyes and face navigate the ha3mnv

          The party seems to fast forward around Large; the MUSIC FADES
          TO ONE LOW NOTE until it breaks with people calling his name.

                         ALL
          Large!
          He snaps his attention to the game. The bottle is pointed
          directly at him.

                         JESSE
          Largeman, this is Dana.
          Large looks over to the sexy young girl whom he locked eyes
          with before. She smiles at him. Awkwardness fills the room.

                         DANA

          Oh, who's up?
          They all laugh. She gets up and slowly walks over to the
          couch. She smiles nervously. Large stares at her. we see in
          his eyes he's feeling more fucked up every instant. She
          stands above him at the couch, then straddles him with her
          knees on either side of his legs; sitting on his lap.
          The MUSIC PLAYS.
          Everyone is speechless. she slowly leans in. Eye contact.
          They kiss softly enjoying every second. Its incredibly sexy.

          actor. I mean on "Sheens" you
          couldn't really tell 'cause he was
          in a hairy gnome suit, but he used
          to put on these really low-budge
          renditions of Andrew Lloyd Webber
          musicals in our attic when we were
          kids and they were awful. It sucks

          Yeah and he's been here ever since.

          No I'm not. I mean I'm Jewish, but
          I'm not really Jewish. I don't do
          anything Jewish. I don't go to

          know any Jews who go to temple. The

                The family has asked me to say a few words 
                before we proceed. No words that I could say, 
                would begin to describe the loss and grieving, 
                one word that keeps ringing in my ear is 
                Why?. Why would God choose to take this 
                little boy from us? I can't give you an answer 
                to that question, but I can tell you that God 
                has chosen Thomas J for some very special 
                reason, we must find solace in knowing that 
                Thomas J is now in Gods care. In that face,

spills. Valentin moves to wipe it up, sneezes, a barrage of
irritable blessings.

                    DUSHAN
          Leo Nikolayevich is something of
          a Luddite, I fear.

Sofya crosses to the machine, removes the record from the
gramophone, replaces it with another Dushan has brought.

Suddenly, the air is filled with   the final duet from
Mozart's Il Nozze di Figaro. She   returns to her place.
There is a long moment where all   take in the sublimity of
it. Tolstoy walks slowly back to   the table. He stands
completely still. Tears fill his   eyes and roll down his
cheeks.

     Valentin sits by himself on the porch, writes in his diary.
     Down below, some of the disciples listen to peasants play
     music around a bonfire. A voice from the darkness.

                         MASHA
               I'm not supposed to do this

               Masha. You are not supposed to
               smoke at Telyatinki.

     wilting. She begins to weep. An Aria from Madame Butterfly
     comes over

     From a record on the gramophone. The table is set for ten,
     although no one is at dinner but Sofya Andreyevna and
     Valentin. He is visibly uncomfortable. An awkward silence.

                         VALENTIN
               I hope you're feeling better.

               I thought about a career in
               music. The only thing I lacked,

               This aria is very beautiful.. It

               her...Everyone is very moved by
               that...in the opera.

     A long pause. The clink of soup spoons.   Tolstoy enters.
     He doesn't sit.

                                                     58.


                    TOLSTOY
          Our life together has become

Stifling a sneeze, Valentin gets up to leave,tries to flee
the inappropriateness of all this.

Lanka? About how the Sikhs are killing like tons of 
Israelis there? Doesn't that affect us?

Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important 
problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign 
policy is important, but there are more pressing problems 
at hand.

PRICE

BATEMAN 
Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow 
down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world 
hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We 
have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We 
have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and 
oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while 
also promoting equal rights for women but change the 
abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still 
somehow maintain women's freedom of choice.

The table stares at Bateman uncomfortably.

BATEMAN 
We also have to control the influx of illegal 
immigrants. We have to encourage a return to traditional 
moral values and curb graphic sex and violence on TV, in 
movies, in pop music, everywhere. Most importantly we have 
to promote general social concern and less materialism in 
young people.

Bateman is letting himself into the apartment. It is very

He throws some clothes into a suitcase, randomly grabbing 
toiletries and shoving them in.

We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It

Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.

    A disembodied gaggle of jersey clad shoulders, jeans, and
    hats crosses a narrow street. Lights flare, hands are
    stamped, torsos are patted down. Money exchanges hands. We
    descend into a black, throbbing tunnel.

    Explicit music booms from bassy club speakers.   Hips, legs
    feet dancing.

    A GO-GO DANCER struts and wiggles around a brass pole.   Hoots
    and cheers.

    The dancer marches in place, rolling her thonged bottom.
    More cheers, greedy hands stuff dollars into her waistband.

              Let's go! Where all my sexy

    Arms go up.   A collection of whoops ripple the crowd.

    The dancer wraps her legs around the pole and oozes upward
    headfirst. The CAMERA ROTATES as she stretches her booted
    heels into the crowd. We realize that she has been dancing
    on the ceiling.

                           FEMALE DJ (O.S.)
              Oh my God!

    ALIKE (pronounced AH-LEE-KAY), 17, covers her mouth, laughing
    and wide-eyed. She tries to back away from the stage, but is
    pushed forward by a torrent of eager arms waving dollar
    bills. Among them is LAURA, 18, worldly and smooth.

              Where your singles at?!! Where your
              singles at?!! Yeah, baby!

    Laura strains over Alike's shoulder to tuck a bill into the

     Laura and a group of friends play a rowdy game of spades. A
     cute Puerto Rican girl is draped around Laura's neck like a

	          a party tonight here at the house.
	          Doyle's invited his music-playin'
	          buddies over to make a bunch of
	          racket out on the patio.
	
	                    FRANK
	          They ain't even no good. The only
	          one can play is Randy
	          Horsefeathers. He claims he's an
	          Indian. His real name's Randy
	          Collins and he works at the feed
	          mill. He can at least play guitar.
	
	                    LINDA
	          He's no more an Indian than I am
	          though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try
	          and tease you and be mean to you to
	          show off to his friends. Just like
	          he does to Frank and me sometimes.
	          You just ignore it. Or stay out
	          here away from 'em if he'll let
	          you. He's an okay guy till he gets
	          drunk but tonight he'll get drunk.
	          I guarantee it.

          Sara wakes. Headache; dry mouth; the works. The sun through

          Rebecca, up and about, arranging her side of the room. In the
          light of day, we see that she's a knockout.
          Mellow music plays through top-of-the line speakers that
          flank an awesome stereo system.

          Sara reaches Psi U. and closes the door behind her. She looks
          around at the messy first floor. At the PACK OF GUYS in the
          living room, yelling at the hoops game on TV.
          Sara smiles. She's safe.

          INT. ART STUDIO - NIGHT

          Rebecca is alone, with just a crack of light coming from the
          open door to the hallway. She's sketching, still wearing her
          Walkman. Hundreds of sheets of paper are scattered around the
          floor, but we can't see what she's drawing.

          INT. FRAT HOUSE ROOM

          Irene?
          There's a bedroom dead ahead. Warm light pours out. She
          slowly walks to the open door... looks in... and freezes.
          CLOSE ON SARA'S EYES. Horror-stricken by what she sees.
          The bedroom is dark, except for the single lamp, above...
          Irene. She lies on the bed, each of her wrists cuffed to a
          bedpost. A red Hermes scarf is stuffed in her mouth.
          Sara can't move. She stares at Irene in shock.

                         is falling in love with Rafael -- 
                         they were sure he was dead this time. 
                         Somebody wants to do a musical about 
                         him and his mug's on every T-shirt 
                         in Central Park.

               Alex enjoys the lunatic mixture of politics and popular 
               culture.

                         I think he's bigger than Farrah 
                         Fawcett.

               uncomfortable moment. It's not easy to enter the game. Claire 
               attempts to change the subject.

                         are great. You guys?

                         here, Alex... what exactly did you 
                         come back for?

               No more games. Alex addresses Price with conviction.

                 What a wonderful next year it's

           Well, actually I've spent most of
           the time in London studying. Then I
           went to Copenhagen for two
           performances, that was Schubert
           too. My whole life revolves around
           Schubert at the moment. The
           concerts with the Impromptus and
           the Moments Musicaux, and for my
           bread-and-butter work I'm
           developing the sonatas. Not the
           late ones, I think I still need a
           couple more years for those.

          Georges is seated in his armchair and looks at the piano.
          Finally he leans over toward the CD player and stops it. The

                    lunch with me? Somewhere not in the
                    cafeteria. For once. Out somewhere?
                    In the world. I was wondering that.

     that... raising the flag in a downpour, only... he's

      unforgettable blue eyes... We hear the door opening...

          Mercedes and Frances are ATTACKING the house with vacuums,

          BOOKS on Shakespeare and Shaw go on shelves where Dean's
          tomes used to rest. Computer wires are not even untangled,

          The street is empty. Larry is on his scooter, riding around
          and around and around the block that he will soon leave.
          He can see his NEIGHBORS through the open windows -- KIDS
          bouncing on a couch...A QUARTET OF OLD FOLKS playing cards
          and laughing... a MOVIE playing on a big TV.

          Music is playing. A nice view is revealed as Mercy arrives on
          a nice little porch. On a little table sits a potted plant.
          In the potted plant is an Altoids tin.
          Mercy gives it a rattle. In the tin, a brand new key.

                         
          Mercy takes the key. Slides it into the lock and slowly
          opens the door.
          The music gets louder. She can't see much into the tiny
          flat, but she can make out...
          Larry, arranging the last of his stuff.
          Mercy stands at the door until he sees her.

                         
          When he does, he says nothing. But steps to her and smells
          her - her neck, her hair.

     Frank says nothing. His  eyes are  closed behind the sun-
     glasses. Devaney picks  up one of  the throwing knives.
     He holds it carefully by the blade  and throws it. It
     misses the post by three feet and  clatters against the

     Frank opens his eyes, sees what's going on and closes his

     A small room at one end of the pool house has been fitted
     with a wall mirror and ballet exercise barre. A STEREO
     plays exercising MUSIC.
     Nicki, dressed in leotards, is doing pre-aerobic stretch-
     ing exercises. Frank appears outside the window. Nicki
     waves him in. Unseen by Frank, a huge St. Bernard lays
     in the front of the door. He muscles his way in, the dog
     never moves, just slides along the floor as Frank pushes
     the door open. Frank looks the room over.

              I'm sorry to disturb you.

              That's all right. It's an excuse
              to rest. It's my private place.
              I'm the only one who works out

     Rachel stands beside him beaming. She bows. Claps back

              a song. I hope you don't mind.
     The crowd roars its approval.
     Frank nervously scans the room. Rachel smiles and moves
     along the stage. MUSIC starts in the b.g. Masking
     obvious fear, she starts to sing.
     As she takes one hand from the microphone, her fingers
     tremble. She clasps it again to hide her anxiety.

     makes a smooth quick turn that puts his body between

     of the noise.

       and the two men watch as Rachel comes out to join her
       sister on the porch, startling Nicki. Both sing for a
       moment, together. Then Nicki stops, embarrassed. Rachel
       gives her a hug.

      An usher near the wall shifts his weight. The orchestra
      conductor turns to look at her. A musician turns his
      sheet music. The dark at the back of the balcony. The

                  like to thank Helen Pollak, a

      He can't see Portman past the glare. He can't fire into

               want to sing you an old song, but
               it's a new favorite.

      band, mike in hand.

STEVEN
(non-confrontational)
I� guess so.

CABLE GUY
You programmed?
(off of Steven's look)
Then let me slave your remotes.

He picks up Steven's remotes, punches in a complicated series of commands, then points them at 
each other. As he holds them together he makes a face as if their power is surging through him.

CABLE GUY
Ooh, maybe we should leave these two
alone.

STEVEN
So after this I'll only need one remote
for everything?

CABLE GUY
You know you're pretty good at this. You
could be a cable guy yourself.
(he finishes)
Now let me check your levels.

With amazing alacrity he adjusts color setting, sound controls, closed captioned, etc. Then he 
clicks through the channels. A music video, documentary on Hitler, Oprah Winfrey Show, starving 
kids, Barney, court TV. The Cable Guy watches emotionless.

CABLE GUY
All right. That about does it. I just
have some paperwork for you to fill out.
Sign here.

Steven does.

CABLE GUY
That gave me power of attorney over you.
(beat)
Joking.

Steven laughs. The Cable Guy joins him, but then continues to laugh way too hard for way too 
long. As the laugh ends it quickly turns into an awkward moment. The Cable Guy does not want 
to leave.

CABLE GUY
I'm about finished here.
(beat)
Okay. I feel good about this.

Cable Guy walks to the door.

STEVEN
One thing.

Title: Cable Guy

Comedy, Drama, Thriller, 
CABLE GUY
Feed me the rock! Feed me the rock! I'm
open!

Steven passes to the Cable Guy, who drives to the basket, pushing Jeff out of the way in the 
process. The ball goes in.

CABLE GUY
(does the foul hand signal)
And one! That's definitely a foul!
(to Jeff)
You want to mug me, my wallet is in my
other pants.

STEVEN
(to Cable Guy)
What are you doing?

CABLE GUY
Don't play from fear Steven. We can take
these guys.

MUSIC UP - SLOW MOTION - STEVEN'S P.O.V.

a. The shirts put a shot which doesn't go in. The Cable Guy swings his elbows wildly as he pulls it 
down.
b. The Cable Guy drives to the basket in slow motion violently taking down two men, including 
Rick.
c. Rick drives to the basket. On his way he fakes out Steven who falls to the floor. Rick scores. 
The Cable guy helps Steven up. As the Cable Guy walks across the court he bangs shoulders 
with Rick.
d. The cable Guy passes the ball to Steven, then sets a nasty pick against Rick, who goes down 
hard.

CABLE GUY
Take it to the hole!

Steven is so un-nerved by the Cable Guy's behavior that he misses a simple lay up. Steven grabs 
his own rebound. When he puts up a second shot, Rick gently fouls him. Steven stumbles to the 
ground. The ball does not go in.

CABLE GUY
Hey, are you okay?

He pulls Steven up.

STEVEN
Yeah. I'm fine.

CABLE GUY
Let's switch. I'll cover Rick.

The cable Guy gets in Rick's face and gives him a death stare.

Steven takes out the ball. He passes to a teammate who passes it to the Cable Guy who drives to 
the basket, then literally steps on Rick's back and leaps into the air and dunks the ball.

34	INT. FIGHTING PIT - LATER

Steven and the Cable Guy are being dressed in armor by the two serfs. The Cable Guy could not 
be happier. Steven is freaked out.

STEVEN
What are we supposed to do? We've got to
be careful we don't hurt each other.

The Cable Guy doesn't answer him. He has his game face on.

CABLE GUY
I cannot listen to any of your
instructions for you are my sworn enemy,
and are about to meet your demise.

Before Steven can answer him the trumpets blare.

HOST
Let the battle begin. Come now people,
let me hear your voices!

The crowd cheers. Music plays. The serfs hand them each a sword and shield, then walk them to 
the center of the pit.

The Cable Guy crouches in a war-like position. He begins to circle Steven like a cat. Steven 
mirrors him, not sure of what to do.

STEVEN
Just take it easy.

The Cable Guy runs at Steven, and swings his sword. In fear, Steven puts his shield over his head. 
The sword smashes into it sending sparks into the air. The Cable Guy darts toward Steven and 
pokes him several times with his sword. Each time Steven blocks it with either his sword or his 
shield.

STEVEN
(enraged)
What are you doing?!

CABLE GUY
(matter of fact)
I'm trying to kill you.

The Cable Guy grabs a mace (a stick with a chain and ball attached to it) off of a weapon filled 
wall and runs at Steven, swinging with abandon. Steven blocks the deadly mace with his shield.

STEVEN
Hey, watch it!

The Cable Guy leaps onto Steven. Then he speaks into his ear as he pushes him down onto the 
ground.

Title: Cable Guy

CABLE GUY
So that's how it's gonna be, huh? All
right. If you want to play rought, Daddy
can play rough.

The Cable Guy charges at Steven with his shield. He upper cuts the shield to Steven's face, 
sending him to the ground.

The Cable Guy runs to the wall and grabs a huge battle ax, a four foot long stick with a fancy 
silver blade on the end of it. He swings it in circles like a Japanese master. Steven grabs a similar 
weapon, and then begin to circle each other.

STEVEN
Chip, this isn't funny! Will you stop
it!

CABLE GUY
The name is Spock. If we don't battle to
the death, they'll kill us both. Good-bye
Jim.

He swings his sword, and they battle 'Star Trek' style. The Cable Guy begins to sing the "Star Trek 
Battle Music" as they fight.

STEVEN
This isn't 'Star Trek!'

MUSIC UP: STAR TREK BATTLE MUSIC

They bang the handles of their battle axes together, jockeying for position. The Cable Guy pushes 
Steven away from him, then takes a huge swing, but Steven leaps in the air over the blade. The 
Cable Guy swings over his head, and Steven blocks it with his ax handle. They continue to swing 
and roll in a vicious battle.

Then the Cable Guy takes a swing which Steven is unable to block. The battle ax cuts through part 
of Steven's protection.
STEVEN
(looking down)
Jesus.

The Cable Guy runs to a horses' entrance. There is a long pause, and then we hear the sound of 
pounding horse hooves. A moment later the Cable Guy rides out on a horse holding a jousting 
stick.

The show's host runs up to Steven.

HOST
Quickly, muster a top your steed.
(Steven doesn't move - the host drops character)
Get on the god damn horse! I don't think
he's kidding!

Left with no choice, Steven jumps on a horse and grabs a joust. The host smacks Steven's horse 
sending it straight toward the charging Cable Guy.
STEVEN
Don't do this!
CABLE GUY
Jim, we have no choice!

Steven and Robin are kissing. Outside it is raining. There is occasional lightning and thunder. In 
the middle of kissing, lightning flashes. Steven looks up and sees a flash of the Cable Guy staring 
down at them, his faced pressed against the skylight. In the next flash he is gone. Was it real? 
Steven looks scared.

They go back to kissing.

The Cable Guy and Robin are speaking on the phone. As the conversation continues we slowly

telephone pole.

into the ground.

CABLE GUY
Steven you've changed.
(beat - then impressed)
I like it.

The Cable Guy convulses his body, pushing Steven off him.

They wrestle on the ground. The Cable Guy gets on top of Steven, then pulls a power drill out of 
his belt and turns it on.

CABLE GUY
I think it's time to make you cable ready.

He slowly brings the drill down to Steven. Steven blindly reaches behind him. He grasps a large 
branch and bats the Cable Guy off him.

The Cable Guy grabs a large tree brance and runs towards Steven. They begin fighting in a fashion 
which mirrors their Medieval Times swordfight.

Steven smashes him in the head with the branch.

               Vince knocks on the door. The front entrance is unlocked,

               Dave isn't really English, he's a young black man from Baldwin 
               Park, who has run a few clubs for Marsellus, including Sally

When he kissed her outside the jail gate.

When he touched her breast the day after he got out of jail.

When they sat behind the Confederate Soldier.

                         Dr. Furtw�ngler is a great musician. 
                         He actively opposed the Nazis and

                         Councillor, no questions asked.

                         to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.

                         Yes, that's true, but he refused 
                         to give the Nazi salute. He kept 
                         his baton in his right hand. In

                         offered him a very attractive 
                         position. Conductor of the 
                         Staatsoper Unten den Linden. He 
                         refused. But I want him. I want 
                         him badly. And I want your help.

                         Hey, just a moment, you should 
                         have discussed this with me first.

                                     DYMSHITZ
                         I'm discussing it with you now. 
                         Major, I want you to drop your 
                         investigation, save everybody time 
                         and trouble.

<title>Fast Times at Ridgemont High</title>

<pre>

FADE IN:

EXT. RIDGEMONT CENTER MALL - NIGHT

From the outside parking lot it looks like an
enormous beached whale. It is the prime hangout for
all the teenagers in the area. Kids mill around the
parking lot or stand by the mall entrance.

INT. RIDGEMONT CENTER MALL

There are three levels of stores underneath a
massive fluorescent roof. Different music comes
from each store. It looks seventies-modern, but
already used and run-down. Groups of kids cruise
the mall, eyeing each other and acting cool.

INT. SWENSON'S ICE-CREAM PARLOR - NIGHT

The teenage waitresses in their peppermint pattie
uniforms are rushing around, trying to keep up with
their orders.

A good-looking man in his mid-twenties enters and
sits. He wears a plastic name tag that says:
"Pacific Stereo Audio Consultant, RON JOHNSON."

Two Swenson's Waitresses pass by with supreme
indifference, and take their orders into the back
kitchen.

INT. SWENSON'S BACK KITCHEN

			WAITRESS #1
	I think he looks like Richard Gere.

The two Waitresses discuss the issue at hand. One
of them, Linda Barrett, is the seventeen year old,
retired sex queen of Ridgemont High.

			WAITRESS #1 (CONT'D)
	I think he looks like... Richard
	Gere. (Bruce Springsteen)

Title: Fast Times at Ridgemont High
Genres:
Comedy, Drama, 
			STACY 
	Do you have a pen? This one's out
	of ink.

			THE RAT 
	Oh... yes.

He pulls one out of his jacket pocket, gives it to
her. Stacy writes her name and phone number on a
scrap of paper and gives it to him. The Rat looks
at the paper.

			THE RAT (CONT'D)
	Stacy. Nice to meet you, Stacy. My
	name is Mark Ratner.

He sticks out his hand, and they shake. We see The
Rat turn around and walk out of Swenson's.

EXT. SWENSON'S - AFTERNOON

The Rat exits with ultimate cool. He sees Damone
waiting just off to the side, talking to some
girls. The Rat nods, gives him the thumbs-up.
Damone returns the gesture. All-Attitude.

EXT. CARL'S JR. - MORNING

Carl's is happening tonight. There are lots of kids
inside. We hear charging rock music -- "Girls Got
Rhythm" by AC/DC -- coming from a radio in the back
kitchen.

INT. CARL'S JR. BATHROOM - MORNING

Inside the bathroom, Brad Hamilton applies the
Carl's scrub brush to a felt tip graffiti message
near the mirror: I EAT BIG HAIRY PUSSY. He pauses
and catches himself in the mirror. He adjusts his
hair.

			BRAD 
	(talking to mirror) 
	Lisa? I have something to tell you.
	Look, I'm a senior now.
	I'm a single, successful guy and
	I've got to be fair to myself.
	Lisa... I think I need my freedom.

Brad pauses, looks at the mirror soulfully.

			BRAD (CONT'D)
	Aw, don't do that... don't take it
	personally, okay? Please? I knew
	you'd understand, because...

The bathroom door opens -- it's Arnold, the boy who
Brad got a job.

			ARNOLD 
	Brad! I know you're on your break,
	but would you cover me on register
	three?

Brad nods, exits:

			CINDY 
	We're going to be going to every
	game this year. We just want the
	crowd to participate and we want
	spirit from every little person in
	this entire school. Allll-Riiiight?

There is unenthusiastic, minor applause from the
assembled students of Ridgemont High. Vice
Principal Ray Connors, a tough-looking man with an
H.R. Haldeman crew cut, approaches the podium. He
has a sour look on his face.

			CONNORS 
	Well, thank you, girls. People,
	don't forget, the big game is one
	week away. We'll see everybody back
	here on Monday and have a good
	weekend.

For the first time during this assembly, there is a
loud and hearty applause.

A GRAINY HIGH SCHOOL FILM 57

We are suddenly watching a movie shown on a class
projection screen. We see footage of a serene,
middle-class neighborhood -- as seen through the
glass windshield of a car. Judging from the other
vehicles parked on the street, the film is from the
early Sixties. We hear the narrative voice of Desi
Arnaz, speaking in his inimitable Latin accent.

			ARNAZ 
	Driving ess an important part of
	each and every one of our da-ily
	lives. Ees a responsibility like no
	o-ther and ess a matter of life
	and...

A ball comes rolling out into the serene street. A
small child runs out after it. The driving of our
vehicle brakes, but not in time. The film freeze
frames on the terrified face of a child about to be
splattered.

			ARNAZ (CONT'D)
	Death.

There is a swell of dramatic music.

			ARNAZ (CONT'D)
	They have foun'... The Braking
	Point.

The words flash on the screen and we hear a high
school Driver's Training class groan in mock
horror.

INT. DRIVER TRAINING CLASS - DAY 

ANGLE ON CHARLES JEFFERSON AND BRAD HAMILTON

who are seated in this class.

ANGLE ON LINDA AND STACY

sitting together in the class. They are oblivious,
lost in conversation.

Title: Fast Times at Ridgemont High
Genres:
Comedy, Drama, 
			THE RAT
	Well... it's getting kind of late.

Suddenly, The Rat is seized with ambition. He
reaches one hand around her right shoulder and
plants the other hand directly on her left breast.
It looks something like a wrestling hold. The Rat
looks at Stacy. Stacy looks back at The Rat. The
Rat is absolutely frozen.

			STACY
	I guess it is getting late, Mark.

She shrugs him off, walks him to the door.

EXT. THE HAMILTON HOME - NIGHT

We see The Rat's forlorn face as he trudges towards
his car. He stops. He takes a breath -- it wasn't
that late, he really didn't want to leave. The Rat
turns and begins walking back up the Hamilton
steps. Just as he does so, Stacy's bedroom light
clicks off. It was too late. He kicks at his car.

			THE RAT
	You blew it, asshole.

Behind him, recklessly speeding towards Ridgemont
Drive, is Charles Jefferson's blue Mustang.

EXT./INT. THE BLUE MUSTANG - NIGHT

Jeff Spicoli is behind the wheel. Sitting next to
him is Little Charles, "L.C.", Jefferson's younger
brother. They're smoking grass and holding
Lowenbrau beers in between their legs. The radio is
blasting the music of Rick James.

			L.C.
	Hey, slow down. This is my
	brother's car.

			SPICOLI
	I thought he was out of town.

			L.C.
	He is.

			SPICOLI
	Then don't hassle it.

They speed off down Ridgemont.

Title: Fast Times at Ridgemont High
Genres:
Comedy, Drama, 
			SPICOLI (CONT'D)
	What the fuck is this guy doing?

The car behind Spicoli then advances to the point
where it is now almost touching the blue Mustang.

			SPICOLI (CONT'D)
	What the fuck is this guy doing?

			L.C.
	This ain't no cop.

The mystery car bumps them lightly from behind.

			L.C. (CONT'D)
	Hey! He's gonna scratch my
	brother's car!

The two boys start yelling. High beams fill the
Mustang with bright light and...

EXT./INT. MUSTANG AND GRANADA

Then mystery car pulls back, then up alongside
Spicoli and L.C. on the left. We hear the music on
the radio of George Thoroughgood's "Ride On,
Josephine".

			SPICOLI
	It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!

			L.C.
	They're fuckin' with us.

The drivers of the two cars eye each others. Then
the Granada begins inching over, trying to force
Spicoli off the road.

			L.C. (CONT'D)
	My brother's car!

			SPICOLI
	All right. Die, Granada Jocks!

Spicoli guns ahead, in a real bullet move, and
easily overtakes the Granada. Spicoli is proud of
himself. He checks himself out in the rearview and
turns to L.C.

Title: Fast Times at Ridgemont High
Genres:
Comedy, Drama, 
EXT. RIDGEMONT BLEACHERS - NIGHT

We see Jeff Spicoli and L.C. sitting calmly in the
bleachers, watching.

			SPICOLI 
	I think we may have gotten away
	clean.

EXT. FIELD AND SCOREBOARD

The half-time gun fires and the score is 36-7...
Ridgemont. Even the Ridgemont players steer clear
of Charles Jefferson as they return to their locker
room.

EXT. THE HAMILTON POOL - HOT AFTERNOON - SEVERAL
WEEKS LATER

Linda and Stacy are sitting by the pool, dressed in
string tie bathing suits. They are listening to the
music of Tom Petty's "Breakdown" playing on the
living room stereo. Linda luxuriously applies
suntan lotion to her chest and legs, in long and
writhing strokes. Stacy reads a book. It's called
Total Orgasm. Several beats pass.

			LINDA 
	I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll
	be so glad when he gets out here.

			STACY 
		(engrossed in book)
	You really ought to look at this,
	Linda. There's a drawing on every
	page... and all these quizzes. It's
	like school.

			LINDA 
	Why don't you put your mother's
	secret book back?

Linda continues regally applying lotion.

			STACY 
	Listen to this... 'What are your
	mate's three most erogenous zones?'

Title: Fast Times at Ridgemont High
Genres:
Comedy, Drama, 
			STACY
	I didn't ask for any help. Did you,
	Linda?

			LINDA
	No.

			DAMONE
	Well, that's exactly why I brought
	some Wisk for the jacuzzi.

			STACY
	O-kay, you guys can come swimming.
	But you have to leave as soon as my
	Mom gets home. Okay?

EXT. HAMILTON POOL

Mike Damone yells "banzai!" and dives into the
small pool. At one end of the pool is the jacuzzi,
which is separated by a tile wall. Damone has
already poured the Wisk into the jacuzzi, and the
detergent has created a huge bubble bath effect.
Damone surfaces and flips into the jacuzzi.

Stacy, looking great in a green bikini, sits
kicking her legs by the side of the pool. Linda
stands on the board. She is poised to dive. The Rat
treads water and stares at both girls. Inside the
Hamilton living room, the family stereo plays the
music of Deep Purple's "Woman From Tokyo".

			DAMONE 
	Hey, Linda! I'll judge your dive.
	I'm a champion diver myself.

Brad arrives home by the side gate and slams it
behind him. He is home from a bad day at work. He
walks out onto the patio and stands with his hands
on his hips. For the first time, our former campus
hero looks absurd. He is still in his uniform from
Captain Kidd Fish and Chips -- it is a blue and
white striped Pirates of the Caribbean outfit,
complete with black plastic sword at the side, and
a ridiculously large Ponce de Leon-esque hat. Brad
carries the hat under his arm.

			BRAD 
	Does Mom know you have company?

			STACY 
	It's just Linda. And Mark from
	school.

Brad ignores the underclassmen, and notices Linda
on the board in her maroon bikini. He smiles.

			BRAD 
	Hi, Linda.

Title: Fast Times at Ridgemont High
Genres:
Comedy, Drama, 
			DAMONE
	No. I don't think so. Not right 
	now.

			THE RAT
	Chicken!

Linda, for one, loses interest quickly. Standing by
the side of the pool, she jams a finger in her ear
and wiggles it.

			LINDA 
	Stacy! I've got water in my ears.
	Do you have any Q-Tips?

			STACY 
	God, I don't think so. Better look
	in the house.

Linda towels off and heads back inside the Hamilton
house. She knows how to walk.

INT. BRAD'S BEDROOM AND BATHROOM - AFTERNOON

We see Brad's room. The Carl's burger picture on
the wall is conspicuously missing. There is music
playing from his stereo -- Pink Floyd's "You and
Me".

We see Brad. He is kneeling on the bathroom floor,
his back to us. His green T-shirt is on, his
underwear in a pile on the floor behind him. His
arm is pumping slowly. Brad is jacking off.

					  DISSOLVE
					  TO:

EXT. HAMILTON POOL - BRAD'S DAYDREAM

It features Linda Barrett, just as she stood on the
diving board a moment ago. She is gorgeous. Her
breasts seem even bigger than usual. Her nipples
are hard, poking through the film maroon string
bikini. Water rolls slowly down her cheeks, into
the corners of her mouth. Her lips are parted
slightly. Her eyes are filled with desire as she
says...

			LINDA 
	Hi, Brad.
		(pause)
	You know how cute I always thought
	you were. I think you're so sexy.
	Will you come to me?

Title: Fast Times at Ridgemont High
Genres:
Comedy, Drama, 
			BRAD 
	You really want me to put all this
	stuff back on?

			HAROLD 
	Yes. I think so. Show some pride,
	Hamilton.

ANGLE ON BRAD

as he stands there, stoic looking.

			BRAD 
	I don't believe you're asking me to
	do this, but okay.

He begins taking off his street shirt. He looks at
Harold, looks at the boxes, and returns to the
closet.

INT. THE CRUISING VESSEL

Brad is driving down the freeway, listening to the
music of Bruce Springsteen's "Out in the Streets."
He pries open one of the fourteen Catch-of-the-Day
boxes on the seat next to him and pulls out a small
piece of fried fish. Brad takes a bite.
The look on his face says it is the worst piece of
shit he has ever tasted. He throws the piece out
the window, and drives on.

Brad turns to see a girl smiling at him from
another car. It makes his afternoon. He returns the
smile with gusto.

ANGLE ON THE GIRL

as she bursts out laughing and drives away.

ANGLE ON BRAD

looking perplexed. Then he realizes that he hasn't
taken his Ponce de Leon hat off. Brad drives on.

A SERIES OF ANGLES ON BRAD'S CAR

as we see the Cruising Vessel move down the
highway. We see the Captain Kidd hat go flying out
the window. Then the plastic sword, and the scarf.
Then a couple boxes of Captain Kidd fish. Then the
rest of them. We see Brad rip past the IBM
Building.

					  DISSOLVE
Title: Fast Times at Ridgemont High
Genres:

ANGLE ON

the back kitchen door, which swings open, and out
comes Mike Damone in a peppermint Swenson's shirt.
He wipes some grime on his pants.

			STACY 
	Mike! You have a mess on C-9!

			DAMONE 
	All right. All right. I just
	cleaned B-8. Give me a break.

			STACY 
	Get going.

The two girls smile, go back to their posts.

INT. JEFF SPICOLI'S ROOM - NIGHT

Jeff Spicoli sits in his room, and it is his
castle. Clothes lie in disarray on the floor. A
huge half-waxed surfboard is propped against the
window. We see Spicoli dressed in a too large white
short-sleeved shirt, attempting to tie his father's
fat paisley tie. He stops to take a hit from his
bong, all the while talking on the phone. The music
of Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Freebird" plays on the radio.

			SPICOLI 
	I... am... so... wasted, mon. What
	is in this shit?
		(pause)
	Doesn't that stuff cause brain
	damage?
		(pause)
	Bitchin'.

Spicoli listens for a moment. He rubs his eyes,
shakes his head. He is really buzzed.

			SPICOLI (CONT'D)
	Hey, mon, I am going to Mexico as
	soon as school is out. Two more
	weeks, bud. Week from Wednesday.
		(pause)
	I am gonna take both boards, my
	duck feet, many cases of beer, and
	just jam.
		(pause)
	No, mon, from school. I'm leaving
	as soon as school gets out. I'll be
	at Sunset Cliffs by nighttime.
		(pause)
	Totally.
		(pause)
	Later.

Spicoli hangs up, and concentrates on tying his
tie. He almost strangles himself. Then suddenly the
door to his room flies open and Spicoli's little
brother Curtis bursts in.

			CURTIS 
	Jeff you have company!

			SPICOLI 
	Go away, Curtis. If you can't
	knock, I can't hear you.

Curtis slams the door and leaves. A moment later
there is a knock.

	Hi.

			SEFELT
	Hi.

Sefelt crosses into the day room where he joins Fredrickson,
who is putting a jigsaw puzzle together.

INT. DAY ROOM - DAY

as McMurphy drifts into the room and looks around. The room
is as it was. The MUSIC ENDS. There is a CLICK. McMurphy's
attention is drawn to the nurses' station.

McMURPHY'S POV OF NURSES' STATION

where Miss Pilbow is SEEN through a large plate glass window,
busy typing a nameplate for McMurphy.

Big Nurse, her back to McMurphy, is turning over a stack of
records. She presses the phonograph button. A record falls on
the turntable and MUSIC BEGINS as she turns and sees
McMurphy.

ANOTHER ANGLE

McMurphy smiles and tips his hat to Big Nurse. 

Big Nurse smiles back and takes her seat. 

McMurphy turns and drifts into the day room. 

Big Nurse looks up and studies him. 

McMurphy catches the eye of a PATIENT, sitting by himself.

			MCMURPHY
	How ya doin', buddy?

	Oh, yeah? What's ailing ya?

He passes it back to Martini, who laughs and passes it back
to McMurphy, who passes it to Scanlon, who passes to
McMurphy, who passes to Billy, etc. Bromden just stands
watching.

			MCMURPHY
		(encouraging them)
	Back and forth, that's it. Shoot,
	man, we'll be takin' on the New
	York Knicks before we're through...

McMurphy looks to see Big Nurse looking out a window at them.
He catches her eye. She turns away.

			MCMURPHY (V.O)
	Hey-ya, hey-ya, come on, come on,
	I'm waitin' on you suckers, you hit
	or you sit...

INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT

The MUSIC is PLAYING. The TV is on the six o'clock news as
McMurphy, cards in hand, is dealing blackjack to Cheswick,
Harding, Sefelt, Billy and Martini. Fredrickson and Scanlon
are looking on as Bromden eases up to the game. Cheswick is
at the nurses' station talking to Big Nurse.

			SEFELT
	Hit me!

			MCMURPHY
	Hit, you say? Well well well and
	with a king up, the boy wants a
	hit. Whadaya know.
	So comin' at you and too bad, a
	little lady for the lad and he's
	over the wall and down the road, up
	the hill and dropped his load.

			SEFELT
	Boogered!

McMurphy rakes in Sefelt's cigarettes, adding them to a pile
of loose cigarettes, packs of cigarettes, several cartons of
cigarettes.

As Cheswick sits down, depressed:

			MCMURPHY
	'Kay, place your bets.

Title: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

	Sorry, ma'am.

McMurphy steps out of the station, closing the door behind
him.

INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT

as McMurphy goes around to the front of the nurses' station
and queues up behind the other Acutes who are getting their
medication. McMurphy reaches the window, takes the cup, but
doesn't take his pills.

			MCMURPHY
		(to Big Nurse)
	Pardon me, ma'am, can I ask you
	somethin'?

			BIG NURSE
		(politely)
	Yes, Mister McMurphy?

McMurphy leans in, placing his hand on the window.

	Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down

McMurphy jerks his hand away.

			MCMURPHY
	Sorry, ma'am... Sorry 'bout that...

McMurphy breathes on the glass and wipes it clean with his
sleeve.

Immediately, the lighting in the room undergoes a complete

light of evening, into the coloured glows of a night-club.

NATHAN sets off towards KYOKO.

CALEB watches, amazed, as KYOKO and NATHAN start dancing
together.

Although NATHAN is drunk, they work through the beats of a
routine they have obviously done many times before.

          The Roman's common, two story home looms in the b.g. at the end of a

          black trench, hat, dark shades. He opens the door and enters the...

          Poppa M listens, far off scratchy music. He moves quietly through
          the house, stopping at the foot of the stairs...listens. He removes
          his rosary, hangs it on the banister and moves on, pulling a weapon.

          that the greenhouse is merely an extension of the home.

          
          The Roman sits in front of a sunken fire pit at a low flame. Across
          the pit, an empty chair. Extended before him is a stunning garden,
          standing in stark contrast to the common house: vines, flowers,
          cobblestone walks, fountains. The center piece is a Turkish pool
          with pure white Lillys afloat.
          Poppa M slowly approaches the Roman from behind. He holsters his
          weapon and sits. The Roman halts the phonograph.

                 I gathered all the film footage
                 that existed on Cobb -- which
                 wasn't much -- and rented the

                 This 1905 cameo of an 18-year-old
                 youth shows a peaches-and-cream

     Stump in the front door -- The place is enormous and
     barely lit. Taxidermied game hangs on the wall.
     Stump is terrified.
     A MAN is sitting in an overstuffed chair reading a news-
     paper. Dressed in a business suit and tie, he seems
     oblivious to the surrounding chaos. He also seems out of
     place.
                             STUMP
               Mr. Cobb?

     The man looks at Stump and points upstairs without
     speaking.

     More CRASHING sounds from upstairs.

               Mr. Cobb?
     The silence is shattered by a SCRATCH, then VIOLIN MUSIC
     from upstairs. STATIC suggests a record is playing.

     Stump climbs the stairs with caution -- Until he's just
     outside the half open door from which light spills. He
     hesitates...
                              STUMP
               Hello?   Mr. Cobb?
     A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT -- Ripping through the door.       Stump
     is terrified -- he gasps for air.
                             STUMP
               Thank you very much, Mr. Cobb,
               but I don't need this job that
               bad.

     Stump turns and creeps back toward the stairs, but --
     ANOTHER GUNSHOT RINGS OUT -- SHATTERING a hanging LAMP.

     Stump freeses one more time.     Silence.   Then the
     voice --
                             COBB
               Yes, Mr. Stump -- you do need this

                  We need each other.

     Cobb reaches over and defiantly turns UP the MUSIC so
     that the room is overwhelmed with Kreisler's violin.
     Stump stares back at this decrepit, overpowering figure.

     Cobb gradually slips into sleep, buried in the music,
     the booze, the pills, the pain...

     Silence.

     The morning mist hangs thick over a snowbank in the woods.
     A rabbit scurries across the snow, some quail are flushed.

     PAN ACROSS the landscape REVEALS the lodge.    Smoke curls
     from the chimney.

     Stump sits hunkered over a tiny portable typewriter on
     the kitchen table. Cobb mixes a bourbon with orange
     juice to wash down some more pills, which he takes
     randomly.

     A teletype MACHINE sits on a table nearby -- Throughout
     the scene, a tape CLICKS endlessly out, piling on the
     floor. Cobb occasionally checks data on the tape.

      LOUD MUSIC and LAUGHTER spills out of the room at the end
      of the hall. We see a woman enter the room.

      Hornsby answers the door -- we can see a party behind
      him, full of old players, booze, cigars -- and even some
      women, though the whole thing is infinitely tamer than
      the smokers Cobb remembers.

               Dennis's twenty students play recorder in rows of attached 
               theatre-style seats. Dennis sits at his desk, a METRONOME 
               ticking, and apathetically leads them in scales, using a red 
               pen as a baton. He keeps one eye on a stack of quizzes that 
               he's marking, stopping to circle mistakes with the pen.

               dismayed by Dennis' uninspired teaching. She enters and 
               crosses to Dennis, speaking quietly to him.

               The students immediately start to chatter.

                         -- and she's taking pictures of 
                         Roberta's classes for a magazine 
                         article about music education.

                                     JUSTIN
                         I wanna be in the magazine!

                         First things first, Justin. Roberta's 
                         gonna explain to you about the 
                         "lottery."

               Roberta steps forward. RAMON OLIVAS (7), a small, adorable 
               Puerto Rican boy with a crew cut, watches her with adoration.

                                     ROBERTA
                         I used to just teach fifty kids at 
                         this school. But now I teach a hundred 
                         and fifty kids at three East Harlem 
                         schools and there's so many children 
                         who want to take violin classes that 
                         we have to have a lottery.

               VANESSA raises her hand, a white girl whose clothes and 
               accessories are always adorned with cats.

                                     VANESSA
                         Can I be in the class?

                         Goodbye! And you may be dropped.

               Vanessa pouts and exits. Roberta moves to ROSARIO, a Puerto 
               Rican girl.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Look at those nails, Rosario!

               She pulls a clipper from her pocket and swiftly clips them. 
               MYESHA nervously glances at her own nails.

                                     ROBERTA

                              (to Ramon)
                         You're doing much better.

               As Roberta walks on to the next student, Justin purposely 
               knocks over Ramon's music stand.

                                     RAMON

                         Ramon, I don't like that kind of 
                         talk. Justin, pick up his stand, 
                         now! Our spring concert is in three 
                         weeks and you might not be in it. Is 
                         that what you want?

               She looks through her book bag, takes out a piece of music 
               and gives it to her.

	steps out, followed by a half-dozen more men all carrying
	Sig-Saur assault rifles -- very heavy artillery.

	SUGAI

	to us, facing out the window.

	Drop down to --

	THE ROOM BENEATH HIM

	A couple are making love in the Hawaiian theme room.

	The door burst open.  Two men, cradling Sig-Saur rifles in
	their arms, step in.  They aim at the ceiling, blasting
	into Sugai's room above.

	THE GIRL

	starts screaming.  The men ignore her and continue to pump

               A taxi slowly pulls up to the home we know. Warmly lit,
               music playing from within. Gene climbs from the cab, as yard
               lights go ON.
               As Gene starts up the path, the front door opens and Amelia
               BURSTS into the night, RUNNING to Gene, JUMPING INTO his
               arms, HUGGING him in her delight. We PULL BACK to...
               George watching it all from the doorway.    His easy smile
               seems comfortably in place, as...
               ...Amelia walks Gene up the path, her arm around his waist,
               talking excitedly, flushed as a schoolgirl. As they reach
               the door...
               George is the picture of calm and dignity. He beams and
               CLASPS Gene's hand. Throws an arm around his shoulder as

               The door closes.   We hear laughter.

              Hey, little help here.  I got Pop Tarts.

      She sees the living room wall -- it's covered with charts, diagrams and
      theories.  Ted on the floor, remote control in hand, replaying the shots of the
      body over and over...

                                  TIFFANY (cont'd)

              Shhhh.  This is the important part.

      Ted rewinds the tape, hits play, rewinds it again as -- Tiffany watches, quietly at
      first, then with growing frustration.  Finally, she walks over and grabs the
      remote control.

                                  TED (cont'd)
              I was watching that.

                                  TIFFANY
              This stops now.  This case is making me and you
              crazy, especially you.

      No response.  Tiffany plops on the sofa and starts leafing through Ted's files.

                                  TIFFANY (cont'd)
              Ya know, I am trying to be supportive.  Leading
              experts agree that's the number one complaint men
              have about their mates.

                                  TED
              I don't have any complaints about my... you.

The MARINE JUROR, the RETIRED POSTAL WORKER JUROR, and AN
UPTIGHT BUSINESSMAN JUROR stand at the urinals, with an empty
urinal between each of them. The MARINE JUROR whistles while
he pees (a classic rock tune, like "Radar Love.") The
BUSINESSMAN sighs, "Ahhhhhh."

The RETIRED POSTAL WORKER JUROR jingles change.

The ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR enters, stepping up to the urinal
between the BUSINESSMAN and the MARINE. He unzips, and it seems
to take him an incredibly long time to extricate his urinary
organ. This does <u>not</u> escape the MARINE'S notice.

                         (innocently, to Marine)
                    I have some gay friends. What's
                    the biggie?

The MARINE says nothing.

                              ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR (CONT.)

                    No, sir. I do not.

The MARINE moves closer to the urinal, so that no one can see
his private parts.

          Oh no, it's not that at all, it's just                          -

          THE BLONDE
          It's just what... exactly?
          She turns, steps toward him. Jonathan opens his mouth to
          explain -- when she covers it with hers. It takes him a
          moment to succumb to her kiss... but not too long.

          INT. PLAZA -- A ROOM - LATER

          A smooth plane of pressed sheets creases as two bare bodies
          lower to them. The Blonde hovering over him, Jonathan's
          tentativeness is all but gone.
          Jonathan cradles her to him, her features softening under
          waves of pleasure as she gasps, and whispers in soft, slow
          annunciation as if it were the sweetest word in our language:

          THE BLONDE
          Fuck.
          LATER: Jonathan lies post-coital. A smile. And then a look of
          mild anxiety, 'what's going on'? He turns to the Blonde but
          she's fast asleep.

          INT. PLAZA - THE', ROOM - EARLY MORNING

          On the sound of a DOOR SHUTTING, Jonathan's eyes squint open.
          Still naked, he props himself up, leans over to find he's all
          alone. A clock radio reveals itself as the source of the
          FAINT CLASSICAL MUSIC we hear. The time reads:                  6:18   am.
          He rises, glances around the room. No sign of her.

          Showered and dressed, Jonathan is talking with a DESK CLERK.

          I've been kinda busy too! I've been
          wondering - did you mean for me to take
          your phone?

          EXT. RHIGA ROYAL HOTEL - NIGHT

          Jonathan walks the carpet-draped sidewalk toward the entrance
          - then pauses, looks around in recognition of this same spot
          where Wyatt had gotten out of the cab that night.

          JONATHAN (V.0.)
          I've got a feeling you did. You dog! I can
          see you grinning right now.
          Jonathan returns the BELL STAFF's chipper greetings and steps
          inside --

          Jonathan seems somewhat more relaxed as he lingers in the
          lobby. A woman with a BOYISH HAIRCUT taps his shoulder.

          INT. THE REGENCY - A ROOM - NIGHT

          Jonathan and an ASIAN WOMAN having sex on a plush celadon
          carpet, two briefcases resting side by side a few feet away.

          INT. CLANCEY INVESTMENT SERVICES - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          Alone as usual, Jonathan now seems strangely contented in
          this isolated state. WORKERS pass in the wall of glass, but
          now he doesn't bother looking up.
          In his briefcase, we note the inclusion of a toiletries bag.

          tiny pierced comma in a presently unadorned earlobe.
          And then he notices, in the far corner: her purse. He stares

          May I ask you a personal question?
          Jonathan spins around, stares frostily into Wyatt's magnetic

          Except Wyatt looks clean and crisp, Jonathan dishevelled and

                         Look at the world today! Is there anything 
                         more pitiful? What madness there is,

                         A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity

                         The time must come, my friend, when 
                         this orgy will spend itself, when brutality 
                         and the lust for power must perish by

          Out of the darkness, Lena's image emerges, the year is `92: A close-
          up of the woman, looking at herself in the mirror, touching up her
          makeup. She grabs a dress by a famous designer of the time and puts
          it on.

          

          
          A few meters away, in the bedroom, Ernesto buttons up his fly, after
          tucking in his shirt tail. The scene is that of a wealthy couple, who
          get along.
          They are preparing to attend a concert. Ernesto is a big fan of
          classical music.

          

          
          Lena looks rejuvenated and more refined. Her life and her facial skin
          have both improved since the first time we see her in Martel's office.
          The moles have disappeared from her face. Her demeanor is still adult,
          that of a young woman who has experienced life.

          

          
          Ernesto Martel frequently rests his gaze on her, fascinated, it's hard
          for him to believe that "such beauty" belongs to him.

          Images that indicate the passing of time during the shooting. Short
          sequences of the minute work done by each of the teams, as if
          assembling ballet pieces, all of it accompanied by a musical score:
          The D.P. sets up the lighting for the shoot, the bulbs are lit, the
          filters applied, the interior of the camera cleaned, the film is
          loaded. The atmosphere is set. Pina in her bedroom, lying on the
          bed, with one leg in a cast, is relaxing, breathing deeply. The
          actress playing Chon jokes around with the costume team, they laugh.
          But no one pays attention to the others. Edurne, in a close-up,
          retouches one of Pina's eyes. The mouth as well. Chon stops laughing
          so that the hair-stylist may shape her hair.
          All the images are very brief... The score predominates, the ambient
          sounds of the activities of the different teams is heard more like a
          whisper. The scene must not last longer than a minute. This set of
          images serves to abridge time and to indicate that the shooting is in
          its final days, after a long journey.
          There will probably not be many images, but less: the bulb that
          lights, Lena's eye as Edurne retouches it, its blinking, its sadness.
          Chon's mouth as she speaks without pause, stopping only when lipstick
          is added. The film loaded, the hair fluffed. Lena lying on the rug
          in her dressing room, totally motionless, her eyes made-up and closed,
          doing breathing exercises for relaxation, her leg in a cast, etc.
          Motor. Action!

EXT. DUTCH REFORM CHURCH - DAY
The MUSIC STOPS. The doors open. The 40 years-old-
minister Bester comes to the door, then stands and greets
his parishioners as they file out of the church.
Amongst them, Ben Du Toit -- his wife, SUSAN, a clean-
cut, immaculate, "toe-the-line" beauty and his son, Johan
-- the blond, blue-eyed, tanned and torsoed fourteen-
year-old every father dreams of. Susan greets friends
and acquaintances, pausing to chat... mostly formalities.
Johan, his eyes on a girl his age. She is with her
father, Mr. Cloete, the headmaster -- she smiles at Johan
from a distance; he waves awkwardly as she drives off
with her parents.
SUZETTE his daughter, sophisticated -- groomed. She
takes her baby from the black nanny waiting in the car,
carries the child to the group chatting with CHRIS, her
husband. She shows it off proudly. Ben is chatting,
concerned, to a WOMAN. She looks drawn and worried.

             He won't come to church. He lies

             I wondered why he wasn't at
             school. Would it help if I came
             to see him? He's always seemed a
             good kid to me.

bored, his    eyes wandering to the Cloete's daughter at
the end of    the pew.

             You know, Lanie, when you run a
             taxi, especially a pirate taxi
             like me, you have eyes and ears
             everywhere. Even when a policeman
             farts in his bed you know. People
             want a reference book, a permit to
             stay in Soweto, a house, anything,
             we taxi drivers know the routes.
             I'll tell you something...

A news bulletin in African language interrupts the music.
Stanley listens.

EXT. DAN PIENAAR SCHOOL - DAY

All four tires of Ben's car have been slashed to ribbons.
INT. BEN'S GARAGE - DAY

Ben and Johan are there.

Ben takes a file from under a toolbox and measures it
carefully against the drawer base. Then, he selects a
piece of wood approximately the size of the drawer and
tries it for size.
We should be in no doubt that's he's constructing a
hiding place.

INT. BEN'S KITCHEN - AFTERNOON
Susan is preparing a roast. There's music from a trans-
istor RADIO. Susan is startled by a voice, her father's
(Ben's FATHER-IN-LAW). She turns OFF, the RADIO.
                           FATHER-IN-LAW
             Roast beef, I hope it's like your
             mother's.
                            SUSAN
                     (happy)
             Papa!
He is aged about 70 years, thick set. She rushes to him
and he hugs her tightly and practically lifts her off the
floor. She kisses him.

                             SUSAN
             Where's Mama?

She disentangles herself and goes to the living room as
excited as a child, the mother is standing by two cases,
smiling.

Susan hugs her.
                             SUSAN
             Mama!

She holds her mother at arm's length inspecting her.

             That would be very useful.

Melanie jumps off the settee.
                           MELANIE
             This calls for a drink.    Gin and
             tonic?

                           BEN
             Please.
As Melanie walks away, Ben looks at her with admiration
and tenderness... her dress swinging around her legs...
her bare feet soundless on the floor... the quiet grace
of her movement.
On the way to the kitchen to get the drinks, Melanie goes
to the record player. There's a record already on the
turntable.

Suddenly as if rising from a dream, Ben murmurs:
                            BEN
             Melanie.   Be careful.

                           MELANIE
                    (as she plays the
                     record and
                     flippantly)
             Of course, Ben.
She goes into the kitchen.

As Melanie hums to herself to     the BLUES MUSIC, in the
kitchen, Ben walks over to the     window and furtively
glances out, to assure himself     that nobody is watching.
He takes then a book on a pile     next to the settee and
pages slowly through it.
Melanie returns with two glasses, still in her happy
mood. She places Ben's glass on the side table next to
the settee, takes the book from him and makes him sit
down.

             And hurry back.
A new track starts on the RECORD.

                    (excited)
             That's my favorite, Ben.

Jumping up and taking Ben's glass and placing it on the
side table, she pulls him to his feet.
                           BEN
             I can't dance.
                           MELANIE
             Rugger player?
They laugh as they start to dance to the slow BLUES
MUSIC. The laughing subsides as they hold each other
closer. The dancing starts to lose the beat of the
music. They look into each other's eyes and Ben envel-
ops her tenderly in his arms hugging her as close as
possible against him.
They stop dancing.     Ben kisses her.   A long, warm and
tender kiss.
INT. MELANIE'S BEDROOM

He is kissing her and fondling her passionately. During

                         of killing.

               Three servants are opening doors and looking into rooms going 
               off the corridor.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The guests are turning around and looking at the Archbishop.  
               The musicians are watching. There is puzzlement and a murmur 
               of comment. The Archbishop tightens his lip.

               INT.   PALACE BUFFET ROOM - DAY - 1780'S

               Mozart is on his knees before the tablecloth, which reaches 
               to the floor. Under it is Constanze. We hear her giggling as 
               he talks.

                                     MOZART
                         Miaouw! Miaouw! Mouse-wouse? It's 
                         Puss-wuss, fangs-wangs. Paws-claws.  
                         Pounce-bounce!

               He grabs her ankle. She screams. He pulls her out by her 
               leg.

               They roll on the floor. He tickles her.

                         started without me!

               He leaps up, disheveled and rumpled and runs out of the room.  
               Salieri watches in amazement and disgust.

               The music is louder. Mozart hastens towards the Grand Salon 
               away from the buffet room, adjusting his dress as he goes.

               INT. GRAND SALON - DAY - 1780'S

               The opening of the Serenade is being tentatively conducted 
               by the leader of the wind-musicians. Guests turn around as 
               Mozart appears - bowing to the Archbishop - and walks with 
               an attempt at dignity to the dais where the wind band is 
               playing. The leader yields his place to the composer and 
               Mozart smoothly takes over conducting.

               Constanze, deeply embarrassed, sneaks into the room and seats 
               herself at the back.

               The music fades down. Salieri stands shocked from his 
               inadvertent eavesdropping. After a second he moves almost in 
               a trance toward the door; the music dissolves.

               INT. ANOTHER PALACE CORRIDOR - DAY - 1780'S

               Mozart and Arco walk side by side. They pass Salieri who is 
               staring at Mozart in fascination. As they disappear, he steals 
               toward the music stands, unable to help himself.

               INT. PALACE CORRIDOR - VIENNA - DAY - 1780'S

               Taking his instructions literally, the Majordomo is marching 
               very slowly toward the salon door. He is followed by a 
               bewildered Mozart, dressed very stylishly and wearing one of 
               the wigs from the perruqier.

               INT. ROYAL PALACE GRAND SALON - DAY - 1780'S

               Mozart comes in eagerly. Immediately the march begins, played 
               by His Majesty. All the courtiers stand, listening with 
               admiration. Joseph plays well, but applies himself fiercely 
               to the manuscript. Mozart, still bewildered, regards the 
               scene, but does not seem to pay attention to the music itself. 
               It finishes and all clap obsequiously.

                                     ORSINI-ROSENBERG

               The Emperor rises, pleased with himself. He snatches the 
               manuscript off the stand and holds it in his hand for the 
               rest of the scene.

                                     JOSEPH

                         enthusiasm, I beg you. Ah, Mozart.

               He extends his hand. Mozart throws himself to his knees, and 
               to Joseph's discomfort kisses the royal hand with fervour.

               The Italian faction - Orsini-Rosenberg and Bonno - laugh 
               discreetly.

                         watching Italian opera, all those 
                         male sopranos screeching. Stupid fat 
                         couples rolling their eyes about! 
                         That's not love - it's just rubbish.

               An embarrassed pause. Bonno giggles in nervous amusement.

                         finest music ever offered a monarch.

               Pause. Joseph is clearly pleased.

                                     JOSEPH
                         Well, there it is. Let it be German.

               He nods - he has wanted this result all the time. He turns 
               and makes for the door. All bow. Then he becomes aware of 
               the manuscript in his hand.

               Mozart does not take it.

                         Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is

               Mozart comes in unexpectedly.

               She seats herself at her mirror and removes her wig.

                         Dear Mozart, my sincere

                         It really is the best music one can 
                         hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?

                         I assume she's the virtuoso in that 
                         department. There can't be any other 
                         reason you'd marry someone like that.

               Salieri looks astonished. There is a knock on the door.

               Salieri is giving a lesson to a girl student, who is singing 
               the Italian art song, Caro Mio Ben.

               There is a knock on the door.

                         Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who 
                         insists on talking to you.

                         Don't keep calling me that. It puts 
                         me at such a distance. I was not 
                         born a Court Composer, you know.  
                         I'm from a small town, just like

                         impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would 
                         be frantic if he found those were 
                         missing. You see, they're all 
                         originals.

               A pause. He puts out his hand and takes up the portfolio 
               from the table. He opens it. He looks at the music. He is 
               puzzled.

                                     SALIERI

                         Yes.

               He rings a silver bell for a servant and abruptly leaves the 
               roam. Constanze stares after him, horrified.

               The servant enters. Shocked and stunned, Constanze goes down 
               an her knees and starts picking up the music from the floor.

                         what did it matter? Had goodness 
                         made me a good composer? I realized 
                         it absolutely then - that moment: 
                         goodness is nothing in the furnace 
                         of art. And I was nothing to God.

                         I have to tell you, Mozart is not 
                         entirely to be trusted alone with 
                         young ladies.

                         As a matter of fact, one of my own 
                         pupils - a very young singer - told 
                         me she was - er - well!

                         She is well. She is - well, actually, 
                         I'm about to become a father! She 
                         only told me last night. You are the 
                         first to know.

                         I'm flattered. And congratulations 
                         to you, of course.

                         Why didn't you come to me yesterday, 
                         Mozart? This is a most painful 
                         situation. Yesterday I could have 
                         helped you. Today, I can't.

                         Why? Here is the music. It's here.  
                         I am submitting it humbly. Isn't 
                         that what you wanted?

                         the world I would rather help, but 
                         now it is too late.

                         to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is

                         as it is. I can't rewrite what's 
                         perfect. Can't you talk to him?

                         He's obviously no friend of yours.

                         Oh, I could kill him! I mean really 
                         kill him. I actually threw the entire 
                         opera on the fire, he made me so 
                         angry!

                         It is your regulation, Sire. No ballet

               Mozart strains to hear what they are saying but cannot.

               We do look at them. The spectacle on stage has now ground to 
               a complete halt.

               Orsini-Rosenberg rises and goes down to where Mozart sits 
               anxiously with the musicians, watching his approach.

               apartment, very pleased with themselves and accompanied by 
               the three actresses. The front door opens, very gingerly.  
               Mozart, still rather drunk, sticks his head into the room, 
               anxious not to make a noise. He sees the strangers and breaks 
               into a smile.

               Dogs are barking wickedly. Michael Schlumberg comes in from 
               his salon. Mozart stands there looking very unwell and 
               bewildered. He is also drunk, but making a careful attempt 
               to keep his composure.

               Salieri extends his hand. In it is a bag of money.

               Almost against his will, Mozart takes the money.

               He turns away. Mozart closes the front door. Instantly we 
               hear the opening of the Requiem Mass (also in D Minor).  
               Mozart turns and looks up at the portrait of his father on 
               the wall. The portrait stares back. Constanze opens the door 
               from the bedroom. She sees him staring up.

               Mozart is sitting up in bed, propped against pillows. The 
               coins lie on the coverlet; many candles burn in the necks of 
               bottles. Salieri, without coat or wig, is seated at an 
               improvised worktable. On it are blank sheets of music paper, 
               quills, and ink. Also the score of the Requiem Mass as so 
               far composed. Mozart is bright-eyed with a kind of fever. 
               Salieri is also possessed with an obviously feverish desire 
               to put down the notes as quickly as Mozart can dictate them.

               The entire Confutatis bursts over the room, as Mozart snatches 
               the manuscript pages from Salieri and reads from it, singing. 
               Salieri sits looking on in wondering astonishment. The music 
               continues right through the following scenes, to the end of 
               the movement.

               We do not hear what he is saying to Salieri, who still sits

               INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S

               Mozart still dictating; Salieri still writing without stop.

               EXT. VIENNA STREET - DAWN - 1790'S.

               The carriage has arrived. Constanze and her son alight with 
               other passengers. Postillions attend to the horses. She takes 
               her boy's hand. It is a cold wintry dawn.

               The music stutters to a close. End of the Confutatis.

                         Do you want to rest a bit?

                                     SALIERI
                         Oh no. I'm not tired at all.

                                     MOZART
                         We'll stop for just a moment. Then

          (Her trunk taps his head)
          I like to get to know a girl
          first...take her out. Meet her
          folks...
          (Her trunk goes lower)
          Of course, aggressive women can be
          a nice change...
          (She tickles him)
          Jacob and Marlena laugh, her mood lightened because of Jacob.

                         MARLENA
          I think you two are engaged.
          They laugh. Jacob is thrilled to have this effect on Marlena.
          A HARMONICA PLAYS A TUNE in the distance. They turn towards
          the sound and see that the two of them are alone in the tent.
          All the workmen have left.
          Jacob and Marlena turn back to Rosie who stands between them.
          There is a awkward, lovely moment of intimacy between the
          three as Marlena strokes Rosie's trunk. Her hand and Jacob's
          come very close to overlapping. When their eyes meet, one of
          them quickly averts their glance...There is clearly a growing
          attraction between them. But it's uncomfortable.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          I think Rosie likes music. That
          harmonica song is lovely.

                         JACOB
          I'm confessin that I love you.
          Marlena stops, her face flushed by Jacob's "confession"�.

                         MARLENA
          What?

                         JACOB
          The name of the song. "I'm
          Confessin' That I Love You."�

                         MARLENA
          (overlaps, realizing)
          --"�Confessin' that I love you."�
          Beat. Jacob tries not to laugh. They return to stroking
          Rosie, trying not to look at each other.

          You look a little pale.
          Kinko holds the mirror to Jacob. We see for the first time:

          JACOB'S FACE HAS BEEN PAINTED AS A CLOWN.

          INT. TRAIN CARS - CONTINUOUS - MORNING

          Jacob races through each car - past musicians, clowns and the
          Coochie Girls - clutching his robe, rubbing the make-up off.
          Along the way, the circus company taunt and tease him with
          sexy hoots and hollers. Kinko follows him, delighted.

          INT. KINKO'S ROOM - TUXEDO PARK, NY - MORNING

          Having cleaned up, Jacob is dressing in his own clothes.
          Kinko sits on his cot "reading Shakespeare"� with a melancholy
          Queenie at his side. When Jacob scratches his shaven balls...

                         KINKO
          Your balls itchy?

                         JACOB

          Earl can not find the words: it's clear the killing of these

            You're sure.  Find out for me.

                         RITA
                   (with a nod)
            Sidney, can I talk to you a minute?

Rita wears an injured air.  Sidney, preoccupied with other
worries, callously ignores it.

                         SIDNEY
            Is Frank D'Angelo around?

                         RITA
            At the bar - Sidney...

But Sidney has moved away from her.

D'ANGELO

He is at the bar, listening with satisfaction to the music,
watching the performers and studying the audience.  Sidney
comes up behind him.  We see Sidney's eyes flick from
D'Angelo towards the bandstand and back again.  Then, as he
takes the stool next to D'Angelo, he assumes a different
manner, a sulky resentment.  D'Angelo sees Sidney.

                         D'ANGELO
                   (to the bartender)
            Joe, give my nephew a drink.

                   (sullen)
            Your nephew doesn't want a drink.

D'Angelo is still watching the quintet.  The guitar can be
heard again.

            And with ten percent of his future,
            you're great, too, Frank.

D'Angelo looks quickly at Sidney, sensing the undercurrent.
Then he turns his back on the musicians, remarking in a
quiet tone.

                         D'ANGELO
            Went over to Philly yesterday an'

                   (shaking his head)
            I only had a few hours.

A glum moment.  Frank sips his highball: Sidney lights a
cigarette, animosity on his face.

                         D'ANGELO
            Thanks for the publicity spread you
            got the boys for the benefit
            tomorrow.

Frank again notes Sidney's resentful manner.  Sidney looks
towards the musicians.

                         SIDNEY
                   (quietly)
            Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.

                         D'ANGELO
                   (quietly)
            Looka, Sidney, you're my own
            sister's son, but where does that
            give you the right to call me a liar?

                         SIDNEY
                   (looking towards Steve)
            You told me that your boy was
            washed up with Susie Hunsecker,
            didn't you?

                         D'ANGELO
            Yeah, and it's the truth, to the
            best of my knowledge.  And, frankly,
            I'm glad.  For Steve's sake, I'm
            glad, not yours.  I manage these
            boys and I got their best interests
            at heart.  Steve shouldn't get
            mixed up with no bimbo at his age.

            Frank, I don't want any secrets
            from you.  I proposed to Susie
            tonight.

D'Angelo hides his feelings, asks:

                         D'ANGELO
            Did she accept?

                         STEVE
            You don't like it, do you.  I think
            she will accept, but I'm not sure.
            She may be too dependent on her
            brother.

He mounts the bandstand.

                         D'ANGELO
                   (solemnly)
            Lots of good people in this town
            are dependent on her brother...

Steve sits on the stool, quietly gives the beat to his group
and begins at once the guitar opening of a very simple and
lonely melody. (The Sage.)

ANOTHER ANGLE

While D'Angelo watches him, the boy continues.  CAMERA
tracks slowly back through the club as the chatter and
babble of the customers begins to diminish in appreciation
of the quiet melancholy of the music.

OUTSIDE THE ELYSIAN ROOM

Susan is standing beside the poster which features Steve,
listening to the music from inside the club.  Sidney comes
to join her.  He is now pretending to be hurt.

                         SUSAN
            You're touchy, Sidney - don't be so
            touchy...

            came to bring him a present.
                   (then)
            Wanna bite to eat?

Susan shakes her head.  She looks up as she hears the
doorman's whistle off screen.  Sidney moves forward to
escort her to the taxi.

LONGER SHOT

They cross the sidewalk and get into the cab.  It starts off
and CAMERA PANS with it.

            I like that boy, Frank.  Anything
            he does is okay with me...

SIDNEY

Sidney, thinking rapidly, leaves the bar, moving
unobtrusively but purposefully towards a telephone booth.
He enters and closes the door.

PHONE BOOTH

A CLOSER ANGLE.  Shooting through the glass panel we see
Sidney dialing.  His manner is urgent.

                                      QUICK LAP DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. ROBARD'S CLUB - NIGHT

A long shot of the club exterior.  A different musical
number is now being played in the interior. (GOODBYE BABY).
A black car comes swiftly under the bridge, turns into the
little square opposite the club, braking sharply.

CLOSER ANGLE

As the car comes to a stop, CAMERA shoots across the hood
onto the windshield where we see the insignia: POLICE.
The occupants of the car are not visible.

INT/EXT. ROBARD'S CLUB

Sidney lingers near the doorway of the club.  He is looking
across the square towards the car which can be seen in b.g.
Now he turns and walks towards the coat rack, CAMERA tracking
with him.  He takes his own coat and, as he thrusts his arm
into the sleeve, contrives neatly to slip some unseen object
into the pocket of Steve's overcoat; CAMERA notes the
gesture, but only very briefly.  Overscene a voice addresses
Sidney:

                         D'ANGELO (O.S.)
            Hey!..........

SIDNEY

A CLOSE UP.  As he turns in swift apprehension, we note the
moment of panic in his face.

REVERSE ANGLE

Shooting across D'Angelo onto Sidney, who now relaxes, his
fears ungrounded.

                         D'ANGELO
                   (continuing)
            Tell that to Hunsecker - tell him
            we agree - he's a big man - he wins
            all the marbles!

SIDNEY

As D'Angelo moves away again Sidney looks after him.  Once
more his face goes tense. (He asks himself, does this
development - which he himself anticipated - change the
situation?) He turns away, moving out of shot.

ANOTHER ANGLE

CAMERA moves with Sidney as he walks towards the doorway.
There he hesitates again; he looks back into the club.

DALLAS

From Sidney's viewpoint.  A LONG SHOT of Steve on the
bandstand.  CAMERA PANS deliberately towards the coatrack in
f.g.  A group of newly arrived musicians walk into the shot,
setting down their instrument cases and starting to hang up
their coats. (Clearly, Sidney could not now return to the
coat rack - even if he decided that he did want to undo his
handiwork.)

RESUME SIDNEY

CAMERA, shooting out across the square, frames Sidney in f.g.
Facing the inevitable, Sidney turns away, walks across the
sidewalk.  On the other side of the square the headlamps of
the car blink twice.  Sidney walks towards it.

POLICE CAR

A big man gets out of the seat next to the driver.  As he
comes round the hood of the car, the headlamps of a passing
truck illuminate him, identifying HARRY KELLO.  CAMERA PANS
as he walks to meet Sidney.

CLOSER ANGLE

            What's all the rush?  You said
            three o'clock.

RESUME SIDNEY

CAMERA, shooting out across the square, frames Sidney in f.g.
Facing the inevitable, Sidney turns away, walks across the
sidewalk.  On the other side of the square the headlamps of
the car blink twice.  Sidney walks towards it.

POLICE CAR

A big man gets out of the seat next to the driver.  As he
comes round the hood of the car, the headlamps of a passing
truck illuminate him, identifying HARRY KELLO.  CAMERA PANS
as he walks to meet Sidney.

CLOSER ANGLE

Kello pauses as Sidney comes up to him, asks affably:

                         KELLO
            What's all the rush?  You said
            three o'clock.

                         SIDNEY
                   (glancing back
                   towards club)
            He's leaving early.  After this
            "set".  He'll be out in a couple of
            minutes...

They wait for a moment, listening to the sound of the music
in the distance.  It is a blues number (GOODBYE BABY) Kello
hums nonchalantly; Sidney glances at him with irritation,
finding something gruesome in his relaxed manner.

INT. POLICE CAR

There are two plainclothes policemen inside, one at the
wheel, the other in the back seat.  The latter leans forward
to ask the former:

                         1ST POLICEMAN
            What's this deal tonight?

                         MURPH
                   (the 2nd policeman)
            One of the lieutenant's "surprise
            parties", I think.

Murph's tone shows obvious repugnance.  The 1st Policeman
broods for a moment; he adds in a quiet, but viciously
resentful manner:

                         1ST POLICEMAN
            One of these days I'd like to turn
            in my badge and tangle with "POPSIE"
            myself - he's no good.

SIDNEY

He turns swiftly and goes up the stairs out of Kello's reach.

                         SIDNEY
                   (as he goes)
            You could be right, you fat slob?

ANOTHER ANGLE

From half-way up the stairs.  Sidney comes up the steps two
at a time.  Kello and Murphy are seen beyond.

                         KELLO
                   (with a guffaw)
            Come back here, Sidney...I wanna
            chastise you!...

FROM THE BRIDGE

Sidney reaches the top.  He comes along the pedestrian walk
up to CAMERA, slowing down he turns across the rail and
looks down towards the square.  CAMERA MOVES to take in the
scene in WIDE ANGLE: Sidney in foreground, the police car
and detectives below, the entrance to Robard's across the
square.  Sidney waits.  In the distance we can hear the
music of Dallas' last number coming to an end.

INT. ROBARD'S CLUB

The last bars of the number.  Enthusiastic applause.

STEVE

He responds to the ovation, nicely but a little wearily.  He
gets down off the stand.  There is too much noise to hear
his parting words to his fellow musicians, but it is clear
that he is urging them to stay without him.  He walks off
towards the entrance to the club.

D'ANGELO

D'Angelo leaves the bar, in search of Steve.  He sees...

INT/EXT. ROBARD'S CLUB - NIGHT

Steve is putting his guitar away in the case, collecting his
overcoat.  In this gesture he is arrested by the sound of

Steve, mildly startled, looks up.

REVERSE ANGLE

Shooting into the club.  D'Angelo comes forward from the bar.
He is a little drunk, a little emotional.  He waddles toward
Steve, then takes the white carnation out of his buttonhole
and puts it in the buttonhole of Steve's coat, saying:

                         HUNSECKER
                   (acid)
            Let me finish what I started to
            say -

Seeing that Hunsecker is not taking his advice, Sidney
strides swiftly to the door of Susan's bedroom.  He knocks
on it.

INT. BEDROOM

SHOOTING TOWARDS the door.  Susan is sitting on the bed in
foreground.  In a methodical, hypnotic way, she is destroying
the contents of the drawer, tearing letters into small
fragments.  Sidney's voice is heard outside: "Susie!" Susan
appears not to hear it; CAMERA TRACKS closer to her.
Sidney's voice is heard again, louder: "Susie!" Susan turns
sharply towards the door.

SUSAN

A CLOSE UP.  Susan rises to her feet, staring at the door.
She begins to back away from it.

RESUME REVERSE ANGLE

CAMERA PULLS BACK as Susan glances down at the record player
beside her.  She turns the knob.  We hear the clatter of a
record dropping and music begins.  The tune is "The Sage."

INT. LIVING ROOM

CLOSE SHOT of Sidney.  He hears the music starting.

HUNSECKER

Hunsecker has come forward.  But now, as he listens to the
gramaphone record playing in the bedroom, Hunsecker relaxes,
assuming that this is a sign that Sidney's suspicions are
unfounded.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (coming forward)
            What a cornball you are, Sidney...

CAMERA TRACKS to include Sidney.  He does not share
Hunsecker's confidence; he knocks again, calling:

                         SIDNEY
                   (anxiously)
            Susie!
                   (in growing fear)
            SUSIE!

CAMERA TRACKS closer to Sidney.  As he tries the doorknob,
CAMERA TILTS DOWN.  Sidney's hand tries the doorknob, finds
it locked, shakes it forcefully.

Title: Sweet Smell of Success

Drama, Film-Noir, 
INT. LIVING ROOM

A similar ANGLE, SHOOTING down on Hunsecker as he comes out
of the bedroom.  But as he starts to roam the vast room,
CAMERA rises higher still, pulling backwards and upwards to
a LONG SHOT which holds the entirety of the big room in all
its ugliness.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (continuing)
            What makes YOU fit to sit in
            judgment on a man like me.  Only a
            great person understands another
            great person, and that leaves you
            out!

Hunsecker is now addressing the whole of the apartment, no
longer pretending even to himself, that the girl is still
listening.  He moves off towards the windows to the terrace
where the curtains are now blowing in the morning wind.  He
goes out towards the terrace, his voice becoming more
distant - a man shouting empty nonsense, addressing no one.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (continuing)
            - That leaves you ALL out!  You're
            pigmies!  You're all sick, weak
            midgets!  I'm proud to be alone!...

EXT. BROADWAY

CAMERA SHOOTS STEEPLY UP towards the top of the Brill Bldg.
(At this angle Hunsecker's terrace will not be visible but
its position is established in relationship to the Budweiser
sign.) CAMERA PANS DOWN to pick up the figure of Susan
Hunsecker as she pushes her way out of the brass doors onto
Broadway.

CLOSER ANGLE

Susan pauses on the sidewalk.  She stays there for a moment.
She breathes in the fresh morning air, looking around with
the expression of someone who sees the world with new eyes.
Then she starts up Broadway - away from the Times Square
area.  The girl's step has a purpose in it; she has
confidence and courage.  Music for the end titles is quiet,
simple and lyrical.

EXT. GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT

SUPER: PATERSON, NEW JERSEY. 1943. ONE YEAR EARLIER.

Over a strip of working-class row homes, we hear the sounds
of a radio announcer giving a dispatch from the war front.

                    RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          American daylight bombers were busy
          again, as our liberators with
          fighter escort continue the air
          offensive with another sock at
          German coastal installations in
          France.


INT. GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT

The radio continues playing to a modest home. We see a young
man cleaning house, sweeping in the background.

                    RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          But the Germans report a big new
          red army push toward Romania. This
          is World War news.

As the war report ends, a stuffy musical piece begins. We
hear a groan from the young man.

From out of the background emerges Allen Ginsberg (now 17,
fresh-faced, horn-rimmed glasses, dutiful son). The kind of
kid who takes care of everything.

He storms up to the radio, switches the station to a fast-
paced boogie-woogie number. He smiles and dances joyfully to
the up-beat number with his broom.

The door slams. Allen looks up, caught in the act, to see his
father LOUIS (40's, school teacher, Jewish working-class
poet) home from work. Allen accidentally drops the broom.

                    LOUIS
          How was she today?

Louis turns off the music. The playful mood dies. Allen spots
the mail in his father's hand.

                    ALLEN
          Fine. Anything for me?

                    LOUIS
          Why? You expecting something?

Allen looks down, a bad liar.
                                                         4.

                    ALLEN
          No.

Suddenly, from upstairs, the sound of glass shattering. Then
a woman whimpering in pain. Allen, worried, looks off, dread
in his face. His father just sighs.

          Then listen to me.

                    NAOMI
          SHHHH. He can hear you!

She's losing it. Allen quickly thinks, turns to her bureau.
He pulls out a RECORD, starts the phonograph and turns up the
volume.

                    ALLEN
          Can he still hear me?

A BRAHMS WALTZ plays.

                    NAOMI
          What did you say?

Allen turns the music up all the way. Allen mimes deafness.
Finally, she understands: their sounds are drowned out by the
music.

Allen reaches for her. She finally softens, takes his hand.

As mother and son waltz together with the music, Naomi
clutches Allen to her, like he's the only thing keeping her
sane. Because he is.

                    NAOMI
          Don't ever leave me.

Allen, trapped, over her shoulder.

From the doorway, we see that Louis has been watching the
whole time.


EXT. GINSBERG FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

Overwhelmed, Allen shakes on the front stairs. She's not
well. The faint sound of jazz, fun from someone else's home
from down the block. Louis comes out onto the porch, with an
open LETTER in hand from the mail pile. He's upset.

                    LOUIS
          Were you even going to tell me you
          applied?!

Allen spies the "Columbia University" seal on the front. He's
been caught. He looks down, ashamed.

          He's Navy. It's catnip for the

Luke pulls out his own waistband and sprays some cologne down
the front. Allen shakes his head. Luke shrugs.

          You hymies are really all about
          work, huh?

Luke slams the door behind. Allen, alone stares out the

A record starts up down the hall. Clarinet, strings. Allen's
ears prick up. He knows this tune.

It's the same BRAHMS from his mother's bedroom.


INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT

Allen walks down a darkened hallway, the music leading him
forward. He reaches a door with a lit transom. He knocks.

reading the Times and smoking.

          Brahms?

Allen walks inside. Lucien looks up, surprised.

shoves the nurse off Naomi.

From deep within, Allen can see she is still there, and we

foot. Grand classical music screeches to a start.

          myself, or if it be--

          That's a run-on.

                    LUCIEN
          Don't edit me!

Lucien shoves Allen. Allen trips off the chair, the noose
snaps tight...and suddenly he's hanging in mid-air. He
struggles. Lucien tries to help, but falls off his own chair.

The pipe starts to bend.

Allen and Lucien panic as they swing through the room,
suspended in air.

The pipe BREAKS. They crash to the ground.

A beat of relief -- are we alive? -- and the two break out
into hysterics.

				    COLD OPENING

	EXT. PARIS CIRCUS - NIGHT

	The normal activity and excitement of showtime around the 
	circus is in evidence where we see the half dark street and 
	alley directly adjacent to the circus tent which (in Paris 
	is an enclosure)... the animals, the midgets, the people and 
	the roustabouts moving with a fixed speed and getting faster 
	as we now know showtime is momentarily due.

	We MOVE TOWARD the action, slowly but definitely picking up 
	SOUNDS and actions of the busy people as we go.

						    STRAIGHT CUT TO:

	EXT. CIRCUS - FRONT OF CIRCUS - PEOPLE ENTERING - NIGHT

	We see barkers, children, people, pushing... buying tickets,

	with the action of the circus customers jamming the

	to out front... building to the final crescendo... as we see 
	the alley empty and clear out vs. the front area clearing 
	and also becoming empty.)

	Helmut hangs back until the very last clown exits Clown Alley, 
	as we:

	INT. CIRCUS PROPER - NIGHT

	The MUSIC is really going strong... and the clowns come on 
	like all forty.  They explode in the ring... doing all their 
	bits and pieces which ultimately brings them back to the 
	entrance area they just came from and they make the "West 
	Point" arch for the TIMPANI DRUM ROLL and the grand entrance 
	of "Gustav" the Great.

	CLOSER SHOT

	"Gustav" makes his famous comedy walk into the tent with the 
	longest pair of tails ever seen (at least 75 feet long) and 
	at the end holding them from dragging on the floor is Helmut, 
	the "Tramp Clown".

	WIDER SHOT

	We see Gustav taking the applause, and it is tremendous.  He 
	stops center of the ring, but Helmut keeps walking and doesn't 
	see the post in front of him as he walks around the post, 
	still holding the tails and goes on his butt, pulling Gustav 
	down as well.  The audience screams with laughter, believing 
	this all part of the act, as we:

	INT. CLOWN ALLEY - NIGHT

	All the clowns are sitting around their respective trunks 
	and there is a sense of gloom permeating the air, as Gustav 
	and MR. SCHMIDT pace back and forth behind Helmut, both going 
	at him unmercifully.

		And if there is another one of your

	Schmidt walks away... leaving Helmut stunned and shocked.  
	Helmut lifts his trunk cover, which opens on a hinge and 
	stays upright, as we SLOWLY CRAB AROUND to REVEAL the "One 
	Sheets" glued to the inside of the trunk lid... as Helmut

	The one sheets are battered and torn and certainly appear to 
	be many years old.  As we PAN the "Lid" to see them all, 
	Helmut's face is reflected in the mirror as we see the tears 
	rolling down his face.  As we FREEZE FRAME, MUSIC hits for:

	The low key light and the silence of the circus is almost

The air has a smoky quality, and the room is filled
with the murmur of voices and the clink of dishes.
Perhaps soft music of an oriental nature is heard in

          What Ben means is that there are no
          Broadway musical shows produced in
          Indianapolis, Indiana. Of course, if
          we lived in New York...
              (For Ben's benefit)
          ...where I hear doctors aren't

                      BEN
              (To Jo)
          I have nothing against working  in New
          York. Nothing except the fact   that
          it's very hard for my patients  to come
          all the way from Indianapolis  for
          treatment.

Drayton looks at his wife disapprovingly.

                      MRS. DRAYTON
          Oh dear, oh dear. I'm always saying

He picks up the phone.

He waits and at that moment there is a sudden, loud,
but happy pounding on the door. Both Jo and Ben jump
and turn toward the door, almost frightened.

Muffled shouts are heard of "Open up! We know you're
in there! Jo! It's us! We're here!"

                         JO
          I go.

She heads for the door, and Ben sits there squirming
with suspense, and annoyance at being interrupted.
Beyond him, Jo opens the door, and immediately four
people pour in. They are Val Parnall and his wife.
Helen, intelligent, sophisticated, and full of life.

The other two are Cindy Fontaine, an American music
hall entertainer, now in England, around forty-five,
more of a character actress than a lead -- and Jan
Peterson, a musical comedy singer nearer Jo's age,
smart-looking, but talkative and slightly
scatterbrained. The women come in first, Helen Parnell
throws her arms around Jo in affectionate greeting.

                       HELEN
          Jo!   You look wonderful!

Val Parnell follows the women in and closes the door
behind him.

                      VAL
          When we got your wire I couldn't believe

a woman laying out music on the organ rack   in the front
of the Chapel. The CAMERA MOVES IN on her,    and as she
turns on her way to the hymn board, we see   that she is

Inside of a small, almost bare room, Mrs. Drayton closes

watching. The CAMERA PANS SLIGHTLY to reveal the rest
of the room. Sitting at a small table is a listless,
young Hank McKenna. He is playing checkers with the
woman we saw at the airport who was standing with the
autograph hunters, watching Jo McKenna. The one with
the dirty glasses, who made a phone call. Hank has
caught the woman in a checker trap, and with obvious
satisfaction jumps three of her men.

          Oh, no!

The Ambassador pauses and looks up at her in such a
manner that she almost shrinks. She tries to say
something, but no words come out of her half-open mouth.
Drayton, however, answers the Ambassador with horrible
servility.

                      DRAYTON
          Right, I'll see to it..

Lucy Drayton looks at her husband with loathing. There
is a polite tap on the door. The Ambassador looks up.

          Your Excellency, the Princess should
          be arriving at any moment.

The Ambassador braces himself, his       chest swells out a
little, h assumes a set smile and       strides from the
room. Just at this moment we hear        a String Orchestra
in the distance strike up some gay       waltz music. The
Ambassador goes out of the door.        Mrs. Drayton is
looking down at the floor.

               Mikey suddenly grips his face back into a tight SMILE,
               frozen. He looks over and waves at the man who confusingly
               waves back.

               Mikey immediately "unfreezes" and sticks his tongue out and

                    Every day it's the same thing. Wake
                    up. Birthday party gig. Drive home.
                    Watch TV. Train... Rinse. Repeat.

                              DONATELLO
                    I know. Isn't it great?
          A beat. Mikey sighs, then walks back downstairs to the LIVING
          ROOM SOFA. He and the camera think he's alone, but before he
          knows it, Splinter is sitting next to him, cross legged,
          still, and sipping tea.

                         That was just a startle response
                         and isn't really an indication of
                         fear!
               Raph does the "blah blah" hand gesture from above. Enters his
               room, slams the door and immediately BLASTS MUSIC...
               ...and it's some annoying pop HIP-HOP song.

          Music builds to a fun number as the two teams run parallel on

          throwing, catching and propelling one another from obstacle

          Leo accidentally slips, PLOWING Raph face-first into a brick

	A kind of ennui has engulfed him. He stands, watching the 
	television set out of which is now pouring the end of an 
	animated cartoon commercial. Then the familiar tinkling 
	music sets in, the inscription, "The Late Show" appears on 
	the screen, and the announcer's voice informs us that we are 
	now going back to the late show, starring Rex Harrison in 
	"Strictly Dishonorable." The whole thing brings a wince of 
	pain to Charlie's face, and he turns and moves wearily 
	through the little foyer into the darkened bedroom. Enough 
	light flows in from the other rooms to show Charlie going to 
	the drawer in the chest of drawers and taking out a 
	ten-dollar bill. He returns the other bills, closes the 
	drawer and just stands there, suddenly so weak and exhausted 
	that he has to steady himself with one hand on the chest of 
	drawers.
 
	Back in the living room, Helen still sits, a slight frown 
	now indicating she is sensitive to the deeply depressed mood

          It's raining. Rate sits in the parked van. No sound except
          RAINDROPS TAPPING the roof. She's looking out at something.
          It's the LIQUOR STORE she drove by earlier. She's-parked in front
          of it, staring at it through-the rain-streaked windshield...

          INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

          Kate puts TWO BOTTLES OF WINE on the counter. The CASHIER rings

     Music BLARES as Ron and T.J. party with two hot girls, KELLY
     and CRYSTAL, 20s. T.J. cuts a line of coke on a mirror while
     Ron dances over to the girls with SHOTS of Jack Daniels. They

     T.J. is having sex with Kelly as Ron kisses Crystal; he leans
     down, snorts what is probably his fiftieth line of coke. He
     shakes it off, slams some Jack Daniels from the bottle as if
     it was Kool Aid. He's obliterated.

     As Ron stares off at something, T.J. waves at Crystal to join
     him and Kelly; as she does, we see what Ron is staring at -- a
     CALENDAR.

     But its days have no numbers. Except one, in blood RED -- 30.
     Ron snaps out of his hallucination.

refrigerator to the stove as Holly, behind her, begins to
speak.  The faint sounds of music are still heard.

As Holly talks, sipping her drink, Hannah busily works in
the kitchen, which contains a large center table stacked
with bowls and plates of food, hanging pots and pans, and
general party clutter.  She walks on-and-offscreen as she
talks and listens to her sister.

As the sisters talk, the piano music stops.  There's the
sound of light applause as Evan begins a new song, faintly
heard in the dining room.

            Mm-hm.

                         FREDERICK
            Have I really taught you everything
            I have to give?
                   (shakes his head)
            I don't think so.

Lee kisses Frederick twice, then releases him and walks out
of the work area.

                         LEE
                   (turning her head in

            Oh, Elliot said he might have a
            couple of clients for you.

Lee walks over to the loft's stereo area, pulling up the
sleeves of her sweater as Frederick talks.

                         FREDERICK
                   (offscreen)
            I'm sure all those morons he
            handles have a deep feeling for art.

Lee picks up a book from the stereo shelf.  She leans back
against the unit, glancing through its pages.

EXT. BEVERLY HILLS BOULEVARD - DAY

Norman, a Los Angeles TV producer and Mickey's former
partner, is driving down a peaceful street lined with palm
trees.  He's wearing sunglasses and headphones.  He clicks
his fingers in time to the music only he hears on his
Walkman.  He's smiling contentedly while Mickey talks over
the sun-filled scene.  The continuous background jazz plays
louder.

            No, no-no-no, I'm sure.

They walk towards the camera, further into the room.  Elliot
puts his arm around Lee.

                         LEE
            What are we doing, meeting in a
            hotel room?  It's terrible, isn't it?

The music stops.  The camera follows Lee as she walks
towards the curtained windows, past a fireplace, a mirror,
some innocuous pictures, a delicate table holding a lamp,
the foot of the bed.

                         ELLIOT
                   (offscreen)
            I-I couldn't think where to invite
            you without taking risks.

                         LEE
            I promised myself I wouldn't let
            this happen till you were living
            alone.  I was so torn when you
            called.

She parts a corner of the curtains, looking out the window,
turning when Elliot speaks.

He walks over to Lee by the curtained windows.

                         ELLIOT
            I resisted so many times.
                   (pausing)
            Don't think badly of me.

He takes Lee into his arms.

                   (whispering)
            I know it isn't.

They kiss, their figures almost silhouetted in the warm glow
of the room.  Elliot takes Lee's coat off without breaking
the kiss.  They embrace.  They kiss each other lightly, then
stronger, more passionately, their embrace much tighter.

And it's later that night.  The harpsichord music begins to
play again as the camera moves over the bed covers to reveal
Lee, lying contentedly under the sheets, her hair fanned out
on the pillows, one arm near her head.

                         LEE
            That was just perfect.  You've
            ruined me for anyone else.

                         ELLIOT
                   (offscreen)
            I don't want anyone else ever to

                   (sighing)
            I was so worried I wouldn't compare
            with Hannah.

                         ELLIOT
                   (offscreen, laughing)
            Oh, my God.

He enters the screen, sitting down on the edge of the bed
next to Lee.  He holds a cigarette.

            "...Gonna buy the records

...as the film cuts abruptly to outside the rock club.  The
music has stopped.  Mickey and Holly, almost in dark
silhouette, are walking at a fast clip along the sidewalk,
arguing.  They pass some lighted clothing store windows; a
few cars go by in the dark street.

                         HOLLY
                   (enthusiastically)

            Oh, well, I cannot communicate with
            you!  I, you know, I never realized
            you were such a tightass.
                         MICKEY
            I can't understand you.  Your
            sisters, both sisters have such
            good taste in music.  I don't know
            where you went, went wrong.

            Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.

            Now come on, you're be--, 'cause

They stop briefly at a street corner and look for oncoming
cars before crossing.  Mickey takes Holly's arm as they walk
across the street towards the camera.

            through architecture school, you

Hannah takes a jacket on a hanger off the rack and looks at
it.  She holds it to her.

                   (interrupting,

            Well, I think he was dying to open

                   (finally looking back
                   and forth along the rack)
            Now...what should I wear to my
            audition?

Hannah turns to Holly with surprise.  She puts the jacket
back on the rack and stares at her; she inhales.

                         HOLLY
                   (explaining)
            I've got a singing audition for a

Hannah begins to look at the rack of clothes on Holly's
side, while her sister stares at her, frowning.

                         HOLLY
                   (defensively)

In the BG, we hear the dum-dum-dum of a giant box.  The
sound gets louder as the box gets closer.  The youths look
down the block and see a tall young man coming towards them.
He has a very distinct walk, it's more like a bop.  This is
RADIO RAHEEM.  The size of his box is tremendous and one has
to think, how does he carry something that big around with
him?  It must weigh a ton, and it seems like the sidewalk
shakes as the rap music blares out.  The song we hear is the
only one Radio Raheem plays.

EXT: STREET--DAY

On a stoop, a group of Puerto Ricans sits talking, drinking
cerveza fr�o, and playing dominoes.  One of their cars is
parked near the stoop, and blasts salsa music.

ANGLE--RADIO RAHEEM

As usual we hear the rap music of Radio Raheem, but
underneath the salsa music.  Radio Raheem does not like to
be bested; the salsa music from the parked car is giving him
competition, this is no good.  Radio Raheem stands in front
of the stoop and raises his decibel level.

ANGLE--STOOP

The Puerto Rican men look at him, then begin to yell at him
in Spanish.  There is a standoff, the rap and salsa clashing
in a deafening roar.  One of the men, STEVIE, gets off the
stoop and goes to the car.

ANGLE--CAR

Stevie turns the car radio off.

CLOSE--RADIO RAHEEM

Radio Raheem smiles, nods, turns his box to a reasonable
listening level, and bops down the block.  Radio Raheem
still the loudest.  Radio Raheem still the king.

Sal grabs his Mickey Mantle bat from underneath the counter
and brings it down on Radio Raheem's box, again and again
and again.  The music stops.

CLOSE--RADIO RAHEEM'S BOX

Radio Raheem's pride and joy is smashed to smithereens.
It's going to the junkyard quick.

ANGLE--PIZZERIA

There is an eerie quiet as everyone is frozen, surprised by
the suddenness of Sal's action, the swings of his Mickey
Mantle bat.  All look at Radio Raheem and realize what is
about to happen.

ANGLE--RADIO RAHEEM

Radio Raheem screams, he goes crazy.

					RADIO RAHEEM
		  My music!

Radio Raheem picks Sal up from behind the counter and starts
to choke his ass.  Radio Raheem's prized possession--his
box, the only thing he owned of value--his box, the one
thing that gave him any sense of worth--has been smashed to
bits. (Radio Raheem, like many Black youth, is the victim of
materialism and a misplaced sense of values.) Now he doesn't
give a fuck anymore.  He's gonna make Sal pay with his life.

Vito and Pino jump on Radio Raheem, who only tightens his
grip around Sal's neck.  Buggin' Out tries to help his
friend.  Mookie just stands and watches as Ahmad, Cee,
Punchy, and Ella cheerlead.

      ANGLE reveals him in the packed bleachers with a diverse CROWD
      of FANS and FRIENDS: Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, Anglos...

      The mood is festive. A VENDOR sells mangos on sticks. Merengue
      MUSIC blasts from a portable stereo in the stands. FANS drink
      Presidente beer out of bottles.

INT. LES FRERS - NIGHT (2:03 AM)

Costa looks miserable. Overheating, anxiously nursing
his water. He looks around. Then REACTS. A note sits
on the bar top. Right in front of him. Costa looks
around. Only sees strange faces.
Costa carefully unfolds the note.       It reads:   "MEET ME IN

THE RESTROOM NOW."








INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Costa walks down a narrow hallway. Paint peeling.        MUSIC
MUTED. Red light bulbs hanging from the ceiling.
Approaching the men's room, Costa looks over his
shoulder. No one is watching.




INT. MEN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Costa cautiously pushes open the door. Stepping inside.
Dingy tiles. DRIPPING FAUCET. Several stalls.
The room seems empty. Costa swallows, bends down.
Checks under the stalls. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing...
Then. Something. At the far stall. A pair of men's
shoes. Black. Polished. Facing the stall door.
Waiting...
Costa freezes.     Backs away as...
The stall door slowly swings open. HINGES CREAK.        A
foot, a trouser cuff. A leg stepping out...

             That's right. You were the cheese
             in the trap. We stopped a monster.
             That's what matters.
Grace is utterly unapologetic.      It makes Costa like her
even more.




INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Grace is in manic cleaning mode. She pulls papers off
the walls. Shoves a pile of clothing in the closet.
Sweeps coffee cups into a wastebasket.
She opens the door for Costa. He enters.        The room is
still a mess, but it feels safe, cozy.

                            GRACE

             I'm sorry.   I'm a pig.

             I don't trust anyone who's too
             organized.
Grace puts some MUSIC ON the CLOCK RADIO.

                            GRACE

             Want a beer?

She grabs a couple cold ones from the mini-fridge.

                           COSTA

  She leans forward -- and, for the firs time since the first
  time -- she kisses him.  This time a proper kiss.  A tiny pause.

        WILLIAM
    Nice garden.

  EXT. MAGIC GARDEN - NIGHT

  They walk around the garden.  It's a moonlit dream.  We see
  the lights of the houses that surround the garden.  They come
  across a single, simple wooden bench.

        ANNA
    'For June, who loved this garden --
    from Joseph who always sat beside
    her.'

  We cut in and see an inscription carved into the wood.  She
  doesn't read the dates, carved below -- 'June Wetherby, 1917
  - 1992.'  She is slightly chocked by it.

        ANNA
    Some people do spend their whole
    lives together.

  He nods.  They are standing on either side of the bench,
  looking at each other.  The camera glides away from them, up
  into the night sky, leaving them alone in the garden.  Music
  plays.

  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING

  William in a towel rushes downstairs, having just had a shower.
  He shoots past Spike.

        WILLIAM
    Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  Have
    you seen my glasses?

        SPIKE
    No, 'fraid not.

        WILLIAM
    Bollocks.
      (still searching --
       with no help from
       Spike)
    This happens every time I go to the
    cinema.  Average day, my glasses are
    everywhere -- everywhere I look,
    glasses.  But the moment I need them
    they disappear.  It's one of life's
    real cruelties.

    funny.  But all that kissing my ears...

        WILLIAM
    Oh no -- this is just getting worse.
    I am going to find myself, 30 years
    from now, still on this couch.

        BELLA
    Do you want to stay?

        WILLIAM
    Why not -- all that awaits me at home
    is a masturbating Welshman.

  Music starts to play to take us through these silent scenes.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

  Max lifts Bella off her couch and carries her upstairs.

  Mix through -- William sits on the couch downstairs -- eyes wide
  open -- thinking.

  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - DAY

  Morning.  Max, all in his suit for the city... Bella kisses him
  goodbye.  William sees this from the kitchen.  She is also
  dressed for work -- and moves back into the kitchen to pack her
  briefcase with law books from the kitchen table.

  EXT. MAX AND BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY

  William emerges from the house, a little ruffled from a night
  away from home, a heads off.

  EXT. NEWSAGENT - DAY

  William walks past the newsagent, heading for home.  We see,
  though he doesn't, a rack of tabloid papers, all of which seem
  to have very grainy, grabbed pictures of Anna on their front
  page.  Headlines --'Anna Stunna'-- 'It's Definitely Her!'
  and 'Scott of Pantartica.'

    I suppose I might have told one or two
    people down the pub.

    Right.

  He puts his head in his hands.  It's over now.

  EXT. LONDON - DAY

  As full, sad music plays -- William begins to walk through
  Notting Hill.

  This walk takes six months... as he walks, the seasons actually
  and magically change, from summer, through autumn and winter,
  back into spring...

  First it is summer -- summer fruits and flowers -- a six-month
  pregnant woman -- Honey with another leather-jacket boyfriend.

  As he walks on the rain starts to fall -- he turns up his coat
  collar -- umbrellas appear.  Followed by winter coats --
  chestnuts roasting -- Christmas trees on sale and the first hint
  of snow.

  Then he comes to Blenheim Crescent, which is startling snowscape,
  for the hundred yard, right across Ladbroke Grove.

  By the time he reaches the purple cafe, the snow is melting and
  in a few yards, it is spring again.  He passes Honey again --
  arguing with her boyfriend, walking away tearful.  Then turns
  past 'the pregnant woman' -- now holding her three-month baby.
  The camera holds on her.

  INT. BOOKSHOP - DAY

  A grey day in the bookshop.  Martin and William.  As ever.  A
  feeling that things in there ever change.

  Ten seconds pass.  Honey rushes in.  Spike, still feeling in
  disgrace, comes in with her but lingers in the doorway.

        HONEY
    Have we got something for you.
    Something which will make you love me so
    much you'll want to hug me every single
    day for the rest of my life.

        WILLIAM
    Blimey.  What's that?

        HONEY
    The phone number of Anna Scott's agent
    in London and her agent in New York.
    You can ring her.  You think about her
    all the time -- now you can ring her!

    Dominic -- if you'd like to ask your
    question again?

        QUESTIONER 1
    Yes -- Anna -- how long are you
    intending to stay here in Britain?

  Pause.  Anna looks up at William.  He nods.

        ANNA
    Indefinitely.

  They both smile -- suddenly the press gets what's going on --
  music -- noise -- they all turn and flash, flash, flash photos
  of William.  Max and Bella kiss.  Bernie kisses a total stranger.
  Spike finally makes it -- he's bright red from running.

        SPIKE
    What happened?

        HONEY
    It was good.

  Honey hugs him.  It's a new experience for Spike.

  Cut to William's face -- flash after flash -- still looking at
  Anna.  They are both smiling.

  INT./EXT. THE HEMPEL ZEN GARDEN WITH MARQUEEN - DAY

  Anna and William at their wedding -- they kiss and walk into the
  crowd.

  Honey, a bridesmaid in peach satin -- she is surrounded by at
  least four other bridesmaids, all under five.

  Nearby, Tony standing, glowing, beside his fabulous,
  pyramidical wedding cake.

  William's mother is not quite happy with how he's looking.  She
  tries to brush his hair.

  Max, dressed in the most devastating Bond-like white tuxedo is
  dancing with Anna -- thrilled.  He does a rather flashy little
  move.  Cut to Bella who is watching and laughing.

  Martin, in an awkward tweed suit, is jiggling to the beat of a
  song, entirely happy in the corner.

  EXT. LEICESTER SQUARE - NIGHT

  A huge premier -- screaming crowds -- Anna and William get out
  of the car, she holding his hand --  looking ultimately gorgeous
  -- he in a black tie that doesn't quite fit.  He's startled.

    SUBTITLE: "Eight Years Later"

    Tiny kitchen, clutter, a MESSENGER BIKE hanging from hooks on
    the wall, a lot of books. There is a PHONE RINGING under the
    bed.

    TYLER ROTH, early twenties, handsome, looking haggard. He is
    sitting on the floor, shirtless, bed head, wrapped in a
    blanket. A GUITAR is on his lap. Tyler has propped some well
    worn, hand written pages of MUSIC against a box of off-brand
    laundry detergent and is squinting at the notes, frustration
    etched in his face.

    A forgettable BLONDE lies sleeping on the bed.

    Tyler, not a born musician, is trying to teach himself one of
    the PHRASES OF MUSIC in front of him. He is completely lost
    in the moment, with DEEP GROOVES in his fingers. By the
    ASHTRAY next to him, we can tell he's been at this a couple
    of hours.

    The Blonde in the bed re: the ringing phone...

    phone, simultaneously glancing at the digital clock. His eyes
    widen in alarm.

          God damn it.

Aidan runs off after Tyler.

Tyler jumps fully into the thick of it, swinging, grabbing
the beefiest Neanderthal in a choke hold and pounding the
guy's face. He fights like a pit bull. Not feeling, not
stopping.

Aidan gets punched in the face. Tyler elbows the nose of the
guy who punched Aidan and it spurts blood. Then someone hits
Tyler in the gut, and he doubles over and takes a knee to the
chin. The musicians get back to their feet and fight back.
It's a brawl.

     Aidan's girl is screaming for the cops. Tyler's girl,
     following the instincts of the inebriated, has teetered near
     enough to the brawl to imperil herself.

     A Neanderthal swings at Aidan and misses, grazing the girl.
     She jerks away in her high heels and crashes to the pavement,
     splitting her lip on impact. Tyler head butts the guy.

57 EXT PARADISE SQUARE DAY

A CROWD gathers in one of the main thoroughfares bisecting the 5 Points. A
beefy SPEAKER is making an anti-Irish speech on behalf of James W. Barker,
a mayoral candidate supported by Tammany's current rivals, the
Know-Nothing Party. Hand-painted signs are everywhere, bearing Barker's
unsavory likeness. A couple of BUSKERS provide a musical score for the
political spiel.

SPEAKER
The potato is a thick vegetable. Heavy. Meaty. Comes out of the ground
dirty and stays that way unless you scrub it and boil it to death!
(cheers and laughs from crowd)
We don't want to keep lem out of the country! We'll even give 'em a place
at our table! But we ain't gonna vote 'em into office.

Much CHEERING and jovial approval from the Crowd. On its fringes,
Amsterdam and the Dead Rabbits make their way roughly across the Square.

SHEENY MIKE
Any Irish hears that will be out for blood.

AMSTERDAM
The Irish is too busy building up Tammany. That's where their brains and
muscle goes. Once they're inside with their cronies, they turn on their
own outside. Tammany'd steal the air and rent the daylight if they could.

SHEENY MIKE
We'd do the same.

Not against our own we wouldn't. That's the difference.

          New York, New York.   1988.
          
          A new breed of narcotics has swept the great city, bringing
          with it a ferocious crime wave more terrifying than any in
          recent memory.
          
          The old criminal order is gone. In its place, new ethnic
          groups rise up to seize control without respect for
          traditional rules of engagement.
          
          Outmanned and outgunned, demoralized by cutbacks and
          scandal, the Police find themselves burying one of their
          own at the rate of twice a month...
          
          The WORDS TURN BLOOD RED, then DISAPPEAR. The POLICE LOWER

          ZOOM INTO a CLOSE ANGLE ON THEM, we HEAR MUSIC. A THUMPING
          POP BEAT. THE CLASH'S "ROCK THE CASBAH"...

          INT. EL CARIBE NIGHTCLUB - MAIN ROOM
          
          A huge, bustling, vibrant nightclub, very `80's. Decadent,
          pure New York. BOBBY emerges from the back room area,
          straightening out his outfit. ROSARIO is behind him,
          fixing herself and walking toward the front of the club.
          Bobby enters the PULSING, VITAL HEART of the place. As he
          appears, everyone approaches, happily shouting out his
          name. He is having a blast.
          
          Bobby is the master of this domain. An `80's version of
          Tony Manero from SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER, but without kitsch.
          He is genuine cool. MUSIC: BLONDIE'S "HEART OF GLASS."
          Bobby waves hello to people, greets them ("Hey, baby!"), a
          pretty girl kisses him (the women love him). Moves with a
          swagger, a DANCE. As he sways, he re-buttons his shirt,
          claps his hands. He is the CLUB MANAGER, and HE LOVES
          every minute of it. He's GIDDY, ALIVE, a PERMANENT GRIN.

                    Now approaching Montgomery Station.

       Oscar and Sophina brace, as the train comes to a stop, almost
       loosing their balance. They laugh at this. The doors open and
       the group, along with the other passengers, exit the car.
     Goldenrod (7/19/2012)                                   73-74.


70     INT. MONTGOMERY STATION LOBBY- MOMENTS LATER                 70

       The group walks through the Bart Station Lobby, ahead A
       MUSICIAN sits in a chair playing an ERHU, a box full of
       dollar bills sits in front of him.

       As the group passes the Musician, Cato drops a dollar in his       
       hat.

                           JASON

                 shit to me!

                 Learn how to play the guitar, and I
                 got you bruh!

       The group steps onto an escalator, and we follow them up to-


71     EXT. EMBARCADERO STREET- NIGHT- CONTINUOUS                   71

       The group exits the BART station and walks out onto the
       Downtown San Francisco street. PEDESTRIANS are everywhere.

               VANESSA appears in the doorway. Juno immediately puts down 
               the guitar. Mark doesn't notice her immediately.

               A new SONG has begun. Mark closes his eyes in ecstasy and

               Mark grabs the STEREO REMOTE off the kitchen counter and

INT. INDOOR POOL � NIGHT

The lane lines are in place.

Detective Atwood is the only one in the water. Up and down
she goes with a long smooth stroke flipping the turns. She's
not swimming for pleasure, she's working out.

The underwater lights cast rippling shadows on the walls and
ceiling and since they are the only illumination, the room
feels spooky.

Atwood's fingers touch the wall. She raises her head to check
her time, then takes off her goggles.

Hanging onto the gutter she tries to catch her breath, lowers
herself under the surface, blows a lungful of bubbles, comes
up to face LARRY, a Man slightly younger than she is, in a
beautiful suit, perched on the edge of the deck looking down
at her.

He has a dress on a hangar over one shoulder and a pair of
shoes dangling from the fingers of his other hand.

                    DETECTIVE ATWOOD
          Hi.

                     LARRY
          Hi. I brought a dress and a pair of
          shoes. I thought we could leave
          from here.

                    DETECTIVE ATWOOD
          Great idea.

She lifts herself to him and they kiss.

		Keep it in your pants, "V".

Some big cars nearby rev their engines.  "V" guns his car and 
it lurches roughly forward.  The sound of the rough running 
engine reverberates in Pete's brain.

				PETE
		This rod is a fuckin, embarrassment,
		Carl.  Whatiya burn in this thing, "V"?

				"V"
		Texaco... What's wrong with that?

				PETE
		Listen.

				"V"
		You gotta be kiddin'... This is the 
		boulevard... You can't hear yourself

Pete shakes his bead with disgust.

"V" pulls the car off the boulevard into "Tops" drive-in.  
Cars are lined up at the "to go" window and all along the 
side of the building where people are hanging out under a 
long metal awning.  MUSIC is playing LOUD.

"V" pulls into a parking spot by the awning.  The headlights 
illuminate a group of HIPSTERS - some dancing, some just 
hanging out.  THREE or FOUR GIRLS hanging out together turn 
toward "V's" car.  They see Pete in the front seat, and one 
of the girls, Sheila, smiles and walks toward him.

				SHEILA
		Hey.  Where have you been?

Pete talks to her through the open window while "V", Carl and 
Lanie climb out through "V's" door.  "V" leans back in.

				"V"
			(to Pete)
		You want somethin'?

				PETE
		No, I'm okay.

"V" walks off with the others to the "take out" window.
Sheila leans in closer to Pete.

				SHEILA
		I missed you.

pulls out - leaving behind a cloud of smoke.

INT. TEN PIN BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT

The bowling alley is divided into a game room area, a bar/ 
restaurant area and a bowling area.

Pete and the group stroll into the bar and take a large 
booth.  MUSIC is playing LOUD.

A WAITRESS takes orders for drinks.

Bowling pins clatter loudly in the distance.

"V" takes one of Sheila's friends and dances with her.

Sheila takes Pete by the arm and pulls him up to dance.  The 
music is fast, but they dance slow.

				SHEILA
		Why haven't you called me?

				PETE
		Sorry... I...

Sheila looks around and moves closer to Pete.  She whispers 
urgently, worried.

				SHEILA

		What's happening to you?  What happened

EXT. VAN NUYS BOULEVARD - NIGHT

Pete rides up the boulevard with the "Cruisers".  He spots 
"V's" car parked at "Tops".

He pulls in beside "V's" car and shuts down the engine.  The 
usual crowd is at the drive-in, including Sheila.

Pete goes up to "V" and Carl and says hello.  He lights a 
cigarette and leans up against a steel pole supporting the 
awning above.  "V" and Carl both notice that Pete is in a bad 
mood.

Sheila is over with her girlfriends.  She hasn't seen Pete 
arrive.

Suddenly Sheila looks over in Pete's direction.  She looks 
like she's seeing something, yet not seeing anything.  She 
keeps looking - staring.

Sheila's POV she sees "V", Carl and a lot of PEOPLE, but 
Pete is not there.

Pete looks at Sheila.  He's unsettled and confused by her 
staring, but not seeming to see him.  He watches her turn 
away and take one of her girlfriend's hands - leading her out 
to dance to the LOUD music.

Pete watches her dance.  Suddenly, he can't see her.  He 
thinks maybe she may be dancing on the other side of the 
building - out of view.  He moves to look and his head is 
struck by a violent pain.  He grabs his head with his hand 
and leans forward.  "V" grabs his arm.

				"V"
		You okay, man?

				PETE
		What?

				"V"
		You okay?... What's wrong7

Pete looks up at "V".  He doesn't seem to recognize him -
"V's" head is a featureless blur.  Pete shakes his head 
trying to drive out the pain.

He looks over again for Sheila.  He sees her there dancing 
with her girlfriend.

		Pete... You okay?

                         fuckin' get the point anymore. I 
                         never did I guess. Y'ask me he's 
                         just become a drunken fuckin' asshole 
                         that's what. And he's gonna take us

                         Don't lecture me Mr. Philosopher, 
                         you never felt a fuckin thing in 
                         your life. I loved that man. I loved

               MATT's car pulls up in the parking lot at the back of the 
               restaurant.  He and JACK get out of the car and go through 
               the open kitchen door.

               INT. GREEK RESTAURANT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

               The kitchen is full of people, some involved in cooking, 
               some standing around smoking and drinking, mostly Greek.

               JACK shakes hands too. They cross the kitchen and go through 
               a bead curtain. Piped Greek music is playing.

               INT. RESTAURANT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

               A smoke-filled private dining room. There is a poker game

               about watching. There is a trestle table laden with Greek

               with ouzo, vodka and wine. It's help-yourself.

               She leaves. JACK watches her go, looks at the page she's 
               given him.

               INT. JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT

               In front of a mirror JACK trims his hair with nail scissors. 
               He is dressed in his croupier's uniform. He straightens 
               his bow tie.

                         to dress for the casino at home...

               JACK sits in the compartment.

                         ... like a musician in his tuxedo,

               An ARAB at the end of the table kisses all his �50 chips 
               and sets them out on the table. The wheel spins. JACK looks 
               round at the PUNTERS.

               The ball bounces, falls on zero. Everybody loses. Many 
               groans.

               A MEDITERRANEAN-LOOKING MAN with a gold bracelet coughs. A 
               gob of phlegm from his mouth lands on a pile of chips that 
               JACK is raking away. A WOMAN in her mid-thirties is 
               appalled.

                         sir.

               He coughs again, but into a handkerchief.

                         shopped me. I'd like to beat the 
                         shit out of her.

                                     JACK
                         I'd like to buy you a drink.

                                     MATT
                         Cheers. Happy New Year. I really 
                         like you, Jacko, you're so fucking 
                         straight.
                              (suddenly)

               INT. GREEK RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               There are four or five PEOPLE left among the debris. MATT 
               has gone.

               JACK is still there, drunk now.

                                     JACK'S VOICE
                         The music stopped, Jack was drunk... 
                         hallucinating. He was back, as a 
                         child, in the Wild Coast Casino.

               A BLACK WOMAN comes over to him. Her name is LUCY.

                                     LUCY
                         You've been avoiding me.

                                     JACK
                              (blearily)

STRANGELY STILL AND TENSE, RAOUL DUKE DRIVES -- SKELETAL,
BEER IN HAND -- STARES STRAIGHT AHEAD.

BESIDE HIM, FACE TURNED TO THE SUN, EYES CLOSED BEHIND
WRAPAROUND SPANISH SUNGLASSES, IS HIS SWARTHY AND UNNERVINGLY
UNPREDICTABLE ATTORNEY, DR. GONZO.

The music pounds DUKE stares straight ahead.  GONZO froths
up a can of beer - uses it as shaving foam.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            I remember saying something like:
            "I feel a bit lightheaded.  Maybe
            you should drive..."

GONZO starts shaving.

            Suddenly there was a terrible roar
            all around us and the sky was full
            of what looked like huge bats, all
            swooping and screeching and diving
            around the car...

Close on DUKE -- shadows flutter across his face.  The
reflections of bats swirl within his eyes.  We push in close
to one eye ball -- SCREECHING SWIRLING BAT-LIKE SHAPES!

screeches to a halt.  He slumps over the wheel.

                         GONZO (CONT'D)
            Where's the medicine?

                         DUKE
            The medicine?  Yes, it's right here.

DUKE spills out 4 AMYL CAPSULES from a tin.

                         DUKE
            Don't worry, this man has a bad
            heart... Angina Pectoris.  But we
            have a cure for it.

DUKE and GONZO break 2 AMYLS apiece -- INHALE DEEPLY.  GONZO
falls back on the seat, staring straight up at the sun.  The
HITCHHIKER looks petrified.

The FACE OF THE RESERVATIONS CLERK TURNS GREEN &amp; GROWS FANGS.
DEADLY POISON!  DUKE LUNGES BACK at GONZO, who GRIPS his arm
intensely -- REACHES OUT to take the ENVELOPE.

                         GONZO
            I can handle this.  This man has a
            bad heart, but I have plenty of
            medicine.  My name is Dr. Gonzo.
            Prepare our suite at once.  We'll
            be in the bar.

GONZO manoeuvres DUKE away from the desk.  DUKE looks
back -- the RESERVATIONS CLERKS is now a MORAY EEL -- green
jowls and fangs.

INT. NAUTICAL BAR - DAY

The bar -- OILY PEOPLE -- quiet music -- nautical theme.
DUKE and GONZO at the bar, a marlin spike hanging on the

            Two Cuba Libres with beer and

            Terrible things were happening all
            around us...

DUKE is staring -- RAPT -- TERRIFIED.  BLOOD FLOWS FREELY
onto the floor.  DUKE keeps his voice low.

IN THE BRONCO.

DUKE hangs on with his beer.  Nothing all around but the
HUGE IMPENETRABLE CLOUD OF DUST.  LACERDA snaps madly away
at nothing at all!

            I'll just keep trying different
            combos of film and lenses till I
            find one that works in this dust!

The SOUND OF MOTORCYCLES RACING...

We hear music and voices singing:

                         BATTLE HYMN
            "...As we go marching on
            When I reach my final campground,
            in
            that land beyond the sun,
            And the Great Commander asks me..."
            [What did he ask you, Rusty?]
            "Did you fight or did you run?"

A moment later, the Bronco races out of the dust.  DUKE
coughs, chokes, drinks beer.

                         BATTLE HYMN
                   (continuing)

            "We responded to their rifle fire
            with everything we had..."

The sound of gun shots...

A DUNE BUGGY races toward them, loaded down with THREE
RETIRED PETTY OFFICERS, DRUNK AS HELL.  The radio blares:
"THE BATTLE HYMN OF LIEUTENANT CALLEY."

The dune buggy is COVERED WITH OMINOUS SYMBOLS: SCREAMING
EAGLES CARRYING AMERICAN FLAGS IN THEIR CLAWS.  A slant-eyed
Snake being chopped to bits by a buzz-saw made of stars and
stripes.  A MACHINE GUN MOUNT on the passenger side.  They
yell over the roaring engines.

            Where's the damn race?

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE BATHROOM - NIGHT

Submerged in green water, GONZO WALLOWS in the steaming tub.
Soap labels and grapefruit rinds float on the surface.  A
large empty pack of Neutrogena soap lies on the floor.  The
shower is on -- the tub overflowing.  THE TAPE RECORDER
PLAYS, from where it's plugged into the razor socket over
the sink.

DUKE turns off the shower -- notices a HUGE HUNK OF CHEWED
UP WHITE BLOTTER.

                         DUKE
            You ate ALL THIS ACID?

No answer.

                   (turning down the volume)
            You evil son of a bitch.  You
            better hope there's some Thorazine
            in that bag, because if there's
            not, you're in bad trouble.

            Music!  Turn it up.  Put that tape
            on.

                         DUKE
            Okay.  You're right.  This is
            probably the only solution.
                   (holds the PLUGGED IN
                   TAPE/RADIO over the tub)
            Let me make sure I have it all
            lined up.  You want me to throw
            this thing into the tub when "WHITE
            RABBIT" peaks.  Is that it?

GONZO falls back into the water, smiling gratefully.

                         GONZO
            Fuck yes.  I was beginning to think
            I was going to have to go out and
            get one of the goddamn maids to do
            it.

                         DUKE
            Are you ready?

He switches "WHITE RABBIT" back on.  GONZO HOWLS AND MOANS
AND THRASHES TO THE MUSIC, straining to get over the top.

Meanwhile, DUKE picks up a grapefruit from the sink -- a
good two-pounder, he gets a grip on it... and when "WHITE
RABBIT" peaks... HE HURLS IT INTO THE TUB LIKE A CANNONBALL.

GONZO SCREAMS CRAZILY, THRASHING AND CHURNING -- CAUSING A
TIDAL WAVE.

DUKE JERKS THE RADIO CABLE OUT OF THE SOCKET -- SLAMS OUT OF

Still in slow motion, the YOUNGER DUKE is trying to eat a
HUGE SPANSULE OF ACID.  With difficulty.

            I decided to eat only half at first.
            Good thinking.  But I spilled the
            rest on the sleeve of my red
            Pendleton shirt.

DUKE stares at his sleeve, uncertain what to do.  C/U of the
door to the men's room as a MUSICIAN enters speaking in
slow-motion.

                   (also in slow-motion)
            Well, all this white stuff on my
            sleeve is LSD.

The MUSICIAN approaches and looks down at DUKE'S arm.  A
long pause.

Cut back to tight shot of door as it opens and a very clean-
cut, PREPPY, STOCKBROKER TYPE enters.  He freezes in horror.
We cut to his POV.  DUKE is standing in the middle of the
men's room with the MUSICIAN hunkered down at his side...
sucking on his sleeve.  A very gross tableau.  The
STOCKBROKER slowly eases out of the room.

            With a bit of luck his life was

            Pendleton shirts are getting
            incredible kicks from things he'll
            never know.

INT. A BAR - YEARS LATER - NIGHT

The STOCKBROKER LOOKING CONSIDERABLY OLDER sits looking
lost, confused, a nervous wreck.  The image flares out in a
TV white noise snowstorm.

            Good thinking.  But I spilled the
            rest on the sleeve of my red
            Pendleton shirt.

DUKE stares at his sleeve, uncertain what to do.  C/U of the
door to the men's room as a MUSICIAN enters speaking in
slow-motion.

                         MUSICIAN
            What's the trouble?

                         DUKE
                   (also in slow-motion)
            Well, all this white stuff on my
            sleeve is LSD.

The MUSICIAN approaches and looks down at DUKE'S arm.  A
long pause.

Cut back to tight shot of door as it opens and a very clean-
cut, PREPPY, STOCKBROKER TYPE enters.  He freezes in horror.
We cut to his POV.  DUKE is standing in the middle of the
men's room with the MUSICIAN hunkered down at his side...
sucking on his sleeve.  A very gross tableau.  The
STOCKBROKER slowly eases out of the room.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            With a bit of luck his life was
            ruined -- forever thinking that
            just behind some narrow door in all
            his favorite bars, men in red
            Pendleton shirts are getting
            incredible kicks from things he'll
            never know.

INT. A BAR - YEARS LATER - NIGHT

The STOCKBROKER LOOKING CONSIDERABLY OLDER sits looking
lost, confused, a nervous wreck.  The image flares out in a
TV white noise snowstorm.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Strange memories on this nervous
            night in Las Vegas.
                   (he gets up, pours
                   himself a drink)
            Has it been five years?  Six?  It
            seems like a lifetime -- the kind
            of peak that never comes again.
            San Francisco in the middle sixties
            was a very special time and place
            to be a part of.  But no
            explanation, no mix of words or
            music or memories can touch that
            sense of knowing that you were
            there and alive in that corner of
            time and the world.  Whatever it
            meant.

DUKE throws open the curtains.  Light streams in.

mangled tape recorder in front of him.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Memories of that night are extremely
            hazy...

DUKE fast forwards through the tape -- SEARCHING: "Awwww,
mama... can this really...be the end...?"

EXT. SAFEWAY SUPERMARKET - DAY

The WHITE WHALE waits -- gleaming -- beautiful.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            There is a definite obligation,
            when you boom around Vegas in a
            white Coupe de Ville, to maintain a
            certain style.

DUKE and GONZO burst out of the supermarket riding a shopping
basket loaded with COCONUTS, GRAPEFRUIT and TEQUILA.  They
send DEFEATED SHOPPERS sprawling.

The trolley collides into the WHITE WHALE.  SHOPPERS gather
at the supermarket entrance to watch -- baskets loaded with
junk, SCREAMING KIDS and EMPTY WALLETS.

DUKE switches on the music: JUMPING JACK FLASH.  He selects
a coconut -- ceremonially balances it on the hood.  GONZO
pulls out a silver claw-hammer.  A sly look at the gathering
CROWD... then he smashes the hammer down on the coconut!

A GASP from the surly SHOPPERS.

DUKE places another coconut.  SMASH!  Milk and white meat
flies everywhere.

                         SHOPPER #1
            Hey!  Is that your car?

                         DUKE
            Sure is.

SMASH!  Coconut fragments fly.

                         DUKE
            Any of you folks want the milk?
            We're after the meat.  This is
            honest coconut essence.  Real meat.

SMASH!

                 May I begin, sir?

       WILL looks at the stage and sees a handsome young man, 
       with a hat shadowing his eyes.

                           WILL
                 Your name?

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS
                 Thomas Kent. I would like to do a 
                 speech by a writer who commands the 
                 heart of every player.

       WILL can hardly manage a nod.

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS (CONT'D)
                 "What light is light, if Silvia be not 
                 seen, What joy is joy, if Silvia be 
                 not by? Unless it be to think that she 
                 is by And feed upon the shadow of 
                 perfection.

       It does not take four lines of "VALENTINE'S" speech to 
       confirm for us, if confirmation be needed, that THOMAS is 
       VIOLA. For WILL, amazement at hearing his own words soon 
       gives away to something else. He is captivated. He has 
       found his "ROMEO".

                           VIOLA AS THOMAS (CONT'D)
                 " �except I be by Silvia in the night,

                 Unless I look on Silvia in the day, 
                 There is no day for me to look upon."

       WILL interrupts "him."

                 Take off your hat.

       His foot comes off the gas. As the gun car passes, he

       direction into the Projects, and Abruzzo sees Spearman pull
       over. Then the laundry truck turns in, and Richie's slows

              Swenson, the Arizona quarterback, throws a wobbly pass into

              flips and comes down like a sack of potatoes, with a thud,
              ball still in his hands. His head hits the astroturf, hard.

              his pride as he catches the lousy pass, and then... like two
              bulls, the Philadelphia defenders enter from each side.  One
              cuts his legs out from under him, and Rod's taut body
              literally flips.  The second defender then hits him at the
              shoulders.  Tidwell lands on the back of his neck, crumpling
              downwards.  Still holding the ball.  Still.

          No thank you, Dr. Neuman.
           
          As he buttons up his P.J.s, Stanley notices Milo warily sniffing 
          at the strange Mask, which is still lying on the bedside table. A 
          SUBTLE 
          SHIMMER crosses its surface. Milo WHIMPERS and quickly hops off 
          the bed.
           
          We now begin to hear the "Mask Theme"... echoes of the POUNDING 
          Viking drums... growing louder. Haunting whispery VOICES seem to 
          call to Stanley as he slowly crosses to the bedside. He picks up 
          the Mask and turns it over in his hands running his fingers 
          across the time 
          work wood. The music builds...
           
          He turns back to the bathroom mirror and slowly raises the Mask 
          to his face. Milo watches apprehensively from beneath the bed.
           
          For an instant - the MASK SHRINK WRAPS like a vacuum over 
          Stanley's head. We hear the PIERCING MASK SFX.
           
          Then, a beat later, the Mask is off with a POP. The SFX STOP.

          Stanley/Mask looks around, like he's trying to figure a way out 
          of this mess - then -
           
          STANLEY/MASK
          Hit it!
           
          With that, a police SPOTLIGHT SNAPS on, and the brightly lit park 
          entry-way becomes a beautifully lit stage. Stanley/Mask strikes a 
          pose, 
          now wearing a straw hat "boater" and weilding a cane.
           
          Pedestrians with radios and ghetto blasters look down in shock as 
          a RUMBA begins playing from every speaker in town. 
          Stanley/Mask SWAYS seductively in time to the music.
           
          A FEMALE COP steps forward, a look of surprise spreaading over 
          her face as, against her will, she opens her mouth in song.
           
          FEMALE COP
          They rave about Sloppy Joe - the

	bare, muddied, frozen.  TILT to Eric.  His gaze moves from the

	INT. CLUB TRASH - NIGHT

	We are now within the neon techno-depths of Club Trash.  The BG
	music is hard, savage, primal:  a doom-laden Radio Werewolf band

	Visible among the posed members of a group called Diabolique is
	Eric, wielding guitar on the club stage.  ND BLUR as people 
	CROSS FRAME.

	GRANGE, 45-50, powerful, a seasoned assassin, cruel but loyal.
	His facade remains stony as he leads three other men briskly
	down the corridor.:  NGO NWA, 50ish, clad Chinese gangster style
	- white topcoat, white scarf, tinted shades - and two body guards
	supplying a power perimeter around him,lean, dark-haired Asian
	killers who would gladly die for Ngo Nwa, which they will in 
	just a minute.

	They have just passed the Diabolique 8X10.  Ngo Nwa's gloved
	fingers, in passing, leave little skid tracks in the dust that
	clear the eyes of Eric in the photo.

	As the foursome reaches the DOOR, Grange turns doubtfully -- 
	suspiciously -- to Nwa.

				NGO NWA
		He will see me... unannounced.

	ANOTHER ANGLE - THE DOOR

	As Grange keys in the enter code the door hisses open.  Without
	a word, Nwa passes inside and the door is pulled shut in
	Grange's face by the Bodyguards, who post themselves to either

	closer.  Shawnee snuggles into Quincy's chest, runs her hands
	down his neck.  The heat from bodies grows.

	Monica and Quincy glance up at the same time and catch each
	other's eyes.  They start to look away but find they can't.
	Eyes locked as they dance, they move together, almost feel
	each other.  Finally, as their bodies turn, they lose sight.

	Monica puts her head to Jason's chest, Quincy slides his
	hands lower down Shawnee's back.  The music continues...

	Jason and Monica are parked up on Mulholland Drive.  LL Cool
	J's "I Need Love" plays on the tape deck.

	Jason has his arm around Monica, ready to make his move.

				MONICA
			(rattling)
		Freshman year, my free throw percentage
		was fifty-one percent, cause I was
		shooting it like a jump shot.

	Jason leans in, kisses her bare shoulder.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		Um...but then sophomore year I was
		shooting seventy-five percent from the
		line.

	Jason kisses her neck.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		...uh, by keeping my feet set and really
		following through.

	Jason goes in for the slam dunk.  Kisses Monica on the lips.
	It's the first time she's really been kissed.  Jason pulls
	away, smiles.

				JASON
		That was nice.

		Uh-huh.

		I'm gonna love winning this championship
		in your house.

				MONICA
		How do you say "you're dreaming" in
		Italian?

	They move into position.  The ball is tossed up.  Italy winds
	the tip and the ball is passed to Sidra.

	Monica hounds her as she brings up the ball.  Sidra shoves
	her off and to the floor, and scores.  No whistle.  Women's
	pro ball is at a whole other level.  Bigger, better, tougher.

	The ball is passed in to Monica.  She drives down court, goes
	up for a lay up.  An Italian player shoves Monica in mid-air,
	taking out her legs.  Monica crashes on the hardwood.

	A whistle.  Monica lays still for a moment, then pushes
	herself up and walks to the free-throw line without a word.
	Without emotion.

	A huge crowd dances fervently to the live Spanish music.  In
	the middle of the floor, the Spanish players are the life of
	the party.

	In a corner, Monica sits with Sidra, drinking and watching
	the festivities.  A large trophy sits on the table.

				SIDRA
		Can you take that damn thing off the
		table.

				MONICA
		You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.

	Monica sets it down in the seat next to her, puts an arm
	around it.  Sidra shakes her head.

				SIDRA
		Still a cocky bitch.

	Monica laughs.  She downs her drink, motions to the waiter.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Hey.

	Monica slowly stops, turns.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Double or nothing.

	Monica stares at him, wonders if she heard right.  Quincy
	limps to his feet, picks up the ball and holds it out to her.

	Monica slowly walks back to him.  They stare at each other.
	No more egos, no more bullshit.  Just love.

	In the moonlight, on the blacktop, they kiss...

	Behind him, in a second row seat, a ONE YEAR BLACK GIRL sits
	in a lap, bouncing, watching feet and legs ballin' on the
	court.

	Quincy leans down, gives the little girl a kiss, then looks
	out at the court.  It's the Los Angeles Sparks and the New
	York Liberty.  The WNBA.

	On the court, the women line up for a free-throw.

				QUINCY
		Let's go, McCall!

	Monica, sporting a uniform with Wright-McCall on the back and
	the number thirty-two, looks over.  Quincy takes their
	daughter's hand and waves it.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Go Mommy.

	Monica smiles back, then steps to the line.  The referee
	tosses her the ball.  Monica stares at the basket, then

				  TOM
		I hear that! See, I knew she was never 
		going to be a ranchest, but I wanted 
		to try -- I thought maybe she'd give

		That's very important to you, isn't it? 
		Home.

				  TOM
		Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean

		-- It's more like, knowing where you're

	House... to Tom's window.

	INT. TOM'S ROOM - DUSK

	A light goes on. Annie enters, cautiously. She's never been 
	in this room. She crosses to the desk, touches it. She 
	notices a tape player and pushes it on. MUSIC PLAYS... She 
	sees a small framed photo -- of Tom's son, years ago.

	Suddenly, she feels like an intruder. She shuts the music off 
	and exits...

	INT. BARN - DUSK

	Annie faces Pilgrim... she gently lifts her hand and caresses

		telling me?

	embrace, surrendering to each other's passions.

	Beat. She nods. The permission Tom is giving her acts like a 
	great burden being lifted, and for the time being, she 
	surrenders and accepts the gift of what they feel. They kiss.

               another day, the stain slowly
               spreads along the horizon, and

     risqu� dance, and the onlookers laugh to see it.

                   And don't worry.     I'm still your friend.

Her voice chokes a little on that.        She shakes her head, half-
grinning at how foolish she feels.        She smiles at him now. Like
she means it.

And leaves.     Without another word.

grunts, squeals, unintelligible words, things breaking. As we

Tert Card and some boys    circle the potato chip barrel, which has
become a handy urinal.     Near the door, Dennis holding forth, arm
tight around Quoyle who    listens, listens, chuckles. Then Quoyle
fights his way...

...OUT of the trailer, to cold night air where the party is MUCH
wilder, given the elbow room. Quoyle steps OVER the supine form o
Billy Pretty, who is singing to himself. Finds Jack Buggit with a
beer in one hand a rum in the other. Wraps a drunken arm around
Jack's neck. Starts to talk in his ear. Jack looks suspicious. A

     Barb pulls on clothes, rakes a brush through her hair. Jean

                  Why the fuck am I brushing my hair?

     She drops the brush. And then an odd sound intrudes from
     downstairs, a song: "Lay Down, Sally" by Eric Clapton.

     The music is LOUD. We follow Barbara and Jean halfway down
     the stairs to REVEAL: Violet, high as a kite, doing a jerky
     little dance by the stereo. The Sheriff stands uncomfortably
     by the door, his hat in hand. She shuffles over to him.

     She laughs at her inability to speak. He takes a Pall Mall
     from his shirt pocket, hands it to her. Lights it for her.

     The sun's just topped the horizon, throws long early shadows
     across the flat expanse of prairie. Scattered trees, a
     ribbon of asphalt leading to a distant lake, telephone poles.

     We're HIGH ABOVE the country road, following the Sheriff

He chambers another round.     Tries again.   Nope.

As the song repeats, Creasy chambers yet another round.
Feels like he misses a beat as he loads one shell into
the chamber. Pinta sings along oblivious. Suddenly the
barrel is at his forehead and the trigger has been
pulled. No gun shot. A click. Hammer against shell.
Creasy is confused. He ejects the shell and catches it
in the palm of his hand. Macro photograph / a small dimple
on the back of the shell is the only evidence of his
actions. Pinta still dances.

     clothing and pins it to a clothes line. The scene is
     oddly... beautiful.

     with her as she slowly walks up the stairs... almost as if
     compelled. As she ascends, looking right past camera, we get
     a clear look into the bedrooms behind her. In one room, we
     catch glimpses of a POP MUSIC POSTER, a PINK DESK... and an
     empty bed frame. In the next, we see a Nerf basketball hoop,
     a life sized Pokemon doll... and half built LEGOs strewn
     across the floor. ...Neither room has doors.

     stolen only hours earlier from one of my best friends, I realized
     that something important was missing from my life.

INT. CLUB. NIGHT

A mass of dancing bodies fills the floor. The music is very loud.

At the side of the dance floor sit Tommy and Spud. The look rather gloomy.
There is an empty seat beside each of them. Spud is drinking heavily.

Tommy turns and speaks to Spud. His lips move but nothing is audible. Spud
is not ever aware that Tommy has spoken.

Tommy bellows in Spud's ear.

Tommy's words and all subsequent conversation in the dance area of the club
appear as subtitles, the character's communications somewhere between speech
and mime.

them out for Mother to choose one.

The Doctor watches in silence as the Hostess, now dressed as a medical

Renton, his Mother and Father sit at a table in the local social club. It is

microphone calls over the PA - Two and four,
twenty-four...seven...fifteen...clickety-click, sixty-six - And so on, as he
draws the numbers from the drum. Everyone studies their cards, except
Renton, who studies the people instead, his drink untouched. The
number-calling continues until suddenly interrupted by Mother's voice.

INT. LONDON PARTY. NIGHT

To loud music and strobing, fractured lights, surrounded by dry ice, Begbie
dances near a tall woman. Other people dance nearby. Begbie gives the thumbs
up to Renton, who sits on a stool at one side drinking from a bottle of
beer. Begbie and the Woman walk away. Renton looks around the club at the
various men and women.

     Diane was right. The world is changing, music is changin, drugs
     are changing, even men and women are changing. One thousand years
     from now there'll be no guys and no girls, just wankers. Sounds
     great to me. It's just a pity that no one told Begbie.

A car sits in a street near the club, windows steamed up.

          The Wilting Girl steals down the dark, narrow alley,        
          headed toward the outskirts of town.
          Suddenly, a heavy wall shoots up from the cobblestones,     
          blocking her way. She startles, but does not stop. She
          goes up to the wall, turns at an angle and slides right
          through the stone, like a ghost.
          On the other side, she emerges from the stone, breathing    
          hard. She looks around and hurries down an intersecting
          passageway.
          She's gone only a few steps, when just ahead of her,        
          thick vines shoot out and form a dense barrier. She
          takes a breath and dives into the surging growth.
          She almost makes it through, but at the last moment,        
          vines wrap her arms and legs, holding her prisoner. She
          gives up, with a sigh. We HEAR the LAUGHTER of a God.

 EXT. PARK - DAY

 Theodore sits on a bench in a park on a rooftop wedged
 between tall buildings. There's not really any view besides
 the trees in the immediate foreground. People sunbathe and
 exercise. He sits, eating a sandwich, his device next to him.
 He looks at the device, then out at what she's looking at.

               And I thought this song could be
               like a photo that captures us in
               this moment in our life together.

               No.

               Call Cecile up and get her to come over.

     She walks over to the "freeze frame" image of Ronald and

               Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love

               Well... you promise you won't say

               friendship and...

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't

                              KATHRYN
               It's worse. I think there's something
               going on between Cecile and her music
               teacher.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Ronald? That's crazy.

                              KATHRYN
               I know. She's so young and he's so -

               she hides under her doll house. I
               questioned whether or not to tell you,
               but something like this could destroy
               her reputation at Oakwood and I don't
               want to see her get hurt.

     Kathryn picks out an expensive suit and approaches the sales
     counter.

               I hope I did the right thing in telling

               She wouldn't say. She apologized to
               your aunt and told her she was going
               to stay with some friends.

	Well, I'm ready.  Put some music on.

Joel crosses to the CD's and studies them.

		JOEL
	What do you want to hear?

		CLEMENTINE (O.S.)
	You pick it.

	You just say.  I'm not really --

		CLEMENTINE (O.S.)
	I don't know!  I can't see them from

Joel studies the unfamiliar CD's.  He picks up Bang On a Can
performing Brian Eno's Music for Airports to look at.
Clementine reenters with her drink.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Oh, excellent choice.

She grabs it and sticks it in the CD player.  The music is
dreamy and haunting and slow.  Clementine falls back onto the
couch, closes her eyes and sips her drink.

		CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
	Mmmmmmm.  Way to go, Joel.  You pick
	good.

Joel sits down in his chair and drinks.  There's a silence,
which seems fine to Clementine but makes Joel anxious.

		JOEL
	Well, I should probably get going.

		CLEMENTINE
	No, stay.  Just for a little while.

Joel, Rob, and Carrie step out of the brush and see a bonfire
down the beach.  People and music can be heard.

EXT. BEACH - LATER

Joel sits on a log, a paper plate of chicken and corn on his
lap.  People warm themselves at the fire.  Joel watches
couples talking, kissing, Rob sharing a joint with a guy.

		JOEL
	You were down by the surf.  I could just
	make you out in the dark.

Joel looks down to the water.  There's Clementine, in her
orange hooded sweatshirt, looking out to sea.

		JOEL (CONT'D)
	Your back to me.  In that orange

	FADE IN:

	CREDITS AND MUSIC OVER:

	INT.  AUDIENCE ROOM - GRANADA - DAY

	We start on a man's elegant slipper.  He is seated in a
	splendid chair.  Moving up the stocking leg, we pass the
	garter of Castile, coming to rest on a pair of delicate
	hands.  His fore finger impatiently plays with a large
	topaz ring.  Over this, we hear distant footsteps, echoing
	on marble floors.

									CUT TO:

	A Castilian face:  aquilaine profile, olive complexion,
	dark eyebrows and meticulously sculpted beard.  This is
	TREASURER SANCHEZ.

	A door slams somewhere, the footsteps getting closer.  We
	can now here a subdued conversation.

	TREASURER SANCHEZ stands up as:

	The door opens at the far end of the large gilded room.
	A WOMEN, magnificent in somber taffeta, enters.  QUEEN
	ISABEL OF SPAIN moves towards him.

	He bows slightly as she sits at the end of the large
	table.  She is followed by a PRIEST, BROTHER BUYL, and
	three dignitaries of Church and State.

	All sit beside her.  TREASURER SANCHEZ takes a document
	and starts to read aloud.

	On screen the words:  GRANADA - SPAIN - 1500

					SANCHEZ
			Your Majesty would wish to know the
			true facts concerning the island of
			Hispanola, our first settlement in
			the New World, and the activities
			there of your servant, Christopher
			Columbus, Admiral of the Ocean Sea,
			Governor of that Island.  You will
			remember with what hopes and
			promises he beguiled us -- the truth
			is that he now presides over a state
			of chaos, degradation and madness
			beyond imagining.

	SANCHEZ punctuates each word carefully.

					COLUMBUS
			If I ever come back, I swear I
			will...

	She crosses to him quickly, placing her hand gently on his
	mouth.

					BEATRIX
				(softly)
			I'm not asking you to swear to
			anything.

					COLUMBUS
			I don't want you to wait for me.

					BEATRIX
				(smiling)
			That's something you can't decide.

	COLUMBUS kisses her.


	INT.  CORRIDOR - BEATRIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	Strange, unearthly music... A flickering light in a dark
	tunnel.  FERNANDO, holding a candle in front of him, walks
	slowly down the dark corridor.

	Quietly opening a door, he walks into COLUMBUS' study.


	INT.  COLUMBUS' STUDY - NIGHT

	CLOSE ON:  A huge illustrated map of western Europe and
	Asia.  FERNANDO'S candle moves slowly across the Atlantic
	Ocean, to the edge of the map.  There, the illustrator's
	imagination has created monsters:  terrifying demons;
	creatures half-human, half-animal.

	Sitting at his desk, COLUMBUS is looking at the map.

					FERNANDO (O.S.)
			You can't go there!

	Turning, COLUMBUS finds his son beside him.

					COLUMBUS
			Why not?

	FERNANDO points at the monsters.  He pulls the boy to him.

					COLUMBUS
			There aren't any monsters, Fernando.
			The only monsters are in here...
				(he taps his own
				forehead)
			Watch!

	He takes a pen, and draws a smile on one of the terrible
	monsters, transforming it at once.  FERNANDO laughs
	immediately.

									CUT TO:

	EXT.  SHIPS AT SEA - WHALES - DAY

	THREE SHIPS ON A BOUNDLESS OCEAN.

	The sea resembling a DORMANT MONSTER, holding its breath.
	A living being, all powerful, capable of unpredictable
	metamorphosis.  Music reflects the loneliness, the anxiety
	of the crew, the fear of the unknown...

	ENORMOUS WHALES moving slowly alongside, surging
	majestically through the waves.  Sinking back,
	disappearing, their cries taking precedent over the music.


	EXT.  DECK - DAY

	A SHIP'S BOY is throwing buckets of water on the deck.

	A SAILOR is busy clearing the ropes around the mast.

	A COOK is blowing life into a brazier, in preparation of
	the evening meal.

	TEN MEN heaving on a heavy rope, raising the top sail,
	punctuating their efforts with a sailor's chant.


	EXT.  SANTA MARIA - NIGHT

	The crystalline north star -- as if seen through an
	instrument.

	COLUMBUS' silhouette, by an oil lamp, standing at the
	prow.  Holding a quadrant he is aiming at the stars.

	SOME SAILORS are watching with curiosity.  One of them is
	ALONSO, a rough, stocky Basque.

	Near COLUMBUS, on a tressel, various books and charts.  He
	makes an entry in the log.  Then goes back to his
	quadrant.  He senses MENDEZ standing next to him.

					COLUMBUS
				(softly)
			Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may
			God be with us...

					MENDEZ
			God be with us admiral.

	MENDEZ doesn't move, continuing to observe COLUMBUS.

          strap of his BACKPACK hanging over one shoulder and walks around the
          house to the back yard.
          
          The yard slopes significantly from the front yard to the back yard,
          and the view of the back of the house reveals two stories. As Jimmy
          turns the corner, he spots a black CAT walking up to him. He grabs

          Music is audible from inside the house. Carter's house is an old
          dilapidated house, with a tiny front yard and huge back yard
          surrounded by trees, with rusty old cars scattered throughout. Just
          about everybody enters the house from the back. BERUBI, in his
          early twenties, very large and athletic, wearing mesh shorts and a
          beat-up t-shirt, and a MALE FRIEND, of a similar age with an average
          build and dressed lazily in khakis and an un-tucked shirt, are
          unloading a KEG from the bed of a PICK-UP TRUCK onto a dolly.
          HEATHER and ALLISON are standing on the back porch. Heather is
          holding a bottle of VODKA in her hand. Heather bangs on the screen
          door. CARTER approaches. In his early twenties, Carter is tough,
          with a modestly athletic build and a gruff voice, and possessing an
          appetite for greasy food and cheap beer. He's a guy's guy.

          civilian clothes, and uniformed sailors swarm down the

          Maggio and Prew, dressed in slacks and Aloha shirts, stand in
          front of what looks like a renovated residence. They give
          evidence of having already accomplished a little substantial
          drinking. The sound of loud piano playing is heard from
          within. A sign over the door reads: NEW CONGRESS CLUB - SOFT
          DRINKS - DANCING - RECREATION - MEMBERS ONLY. The door opens

          sophisticated-looking woman with upswept hair, wears an
          evening gown with a corsage of orchids. The piano music,
          louder with the opening of the door, continues through all of
          the following. The pianist is hammering out "I Don't Want To
          Set The World On Fire" (or a similar hit of 1941).

          He barges past her through the door. Mrs. Kipfer frowns and
          follows him. Prew shrugs and goes in after her.

          the raised ring Ike Galovitch is skipping rope. In the center
          of the ring Thornhill and Henderson are sparring. Holmes

          He is in fatigue clothes, on his knees, scrubbing the floor.
          There is an expression of stubborn hate on his face. Above
          his head in the shot are Galovitch's feet jumping the rope.
          In b.g. of shot is Wilson, seated near ring.

           Well -- I was working in the
           Orderly Room this afternoon and I
           heard the Captain telling Warden
           you're to pull KP every weekend
           from now on. You know what that
           means -- you can' t even go into

           bugle!?
                         
          In overwhelming, uncontrollable protest, Prew slaps the bugle
          away from Clark's mouth. In one motion he wipes the
          mouthpiece on his sleeve, raises it to his lips and blows his
          own wild, violent obligato to the jukebox music.

          Fatso Judson strolls in, stands at the door. Some of the men
          see him, but no one greets him. Fatso threads his way between
          tables as the room slowly begins to return to normal and the

          in a bathing suit, cracks his knuckles loudly.

          audible. He listens contentedly.

    A wall of light and noise as the two walk on stage.
    Cheering, music, banks of searing studio lights. On
    stage, Jamal, an eighteen year-old Indian boy-man
    stares, petrified. He would surely turn and run but for
    the iron grip on his shoulder of the smiling host, Prem
    Kumar.

                 Mumbai!

    Under cover of the wild applause, Prem ushers Jamal
    towards the guest's chair, leaning in and hissing.

                                  PREM (CONT'D)
                 Smile, dammit.

    The lights seem to bore into him but Jamal manages a
    tentative smile. Out of nowhere, a hand slaps him
    ferociously across the face. Then again and again.
    Blood trickles from his mouth.

    The studio lights have seamlessly transformed into the
    harsh bulb of an interrogation light. Jamal is strung
    from the ceiling by his arms.

     Salim is sitting on a chair at the end of a rickety
     wooden pier, though it is not water, but a sea of
     rubbish and sewage that lies below them. There are
     dozens of these piers protruding from the slum onto
     airport land, each with a toilet shack perched right at
     the end. Another man hurries up the pier and hands
     Salim a coin.

                                SALIM
                  Immediately, sir.

     Turns to the toilet door.

     Right next to the railway lines is a pond of dirty
     water surrounded by shacks in which dozens of women are
     washing clothes. Trains flash past only feet away from
     them. Down the other end of the pond, nine-year old
     Jamal and Salim are splashing noisily with some other
     children. Jamal's mother pauses in her scrubbing, wipes
     sweat from her forehead and gazes up at the leaden sky.

                  For sixty-four thousand rupees.
                  The British architect Frederick
                  Stevens designed which famous
                  building in India? Is it: A) The
                  Taj Mahal. B) Chhatrapati
                  Shivaji Terminus. C) India Gate.
                  D) Howrah Bridge. What do you
                  think, Jamal? Are you one of
                  those tea-boys with a penchant
                  for architecture?

     Known to everyone as VT station, this monument to
     Victorian railway architecture is a dangerous place to
     be at rush hour.

49   EXT. MUMBAI STREET. NIGHT.                                49

     Jamal is studying a piece of paper and reading out
     numbers from it. There is something not quite right
     about Jamal- perhaps the fact that there are two feet
     by his ears. Salim is standing on his shoulders and
     spraying the numbers on a wall with an aerosol and a
     certain lack of confidence.

     As if telepathic, Maman signals to Punnoose and he

     Salim, Latika, Jamal and a group of children are
     standing in a line singing a doha- ancient lyrics set
     to music. Maman is leading the singing, walking up and
     down the line listening to each one individually. He
     stops at one small boy, Arvind, and listens. Nods his
     head, pleased, and continues down the line until he
     stops in front of Jamal. Holds up his hand.

     A battered Jamal limps along the river bank towards the
     Taj. He stops, bathes his swollen face in the river.
     Then looks up. Strange lights appear to emanate from
     the base of the monument. And then strange sounds.

     Jamal climbs   a crumbling   wall and is confronted with an
     opera taking   place right   under the dome. Gluck's Orfeo
     ed Euridice.   Hundreds of   India's smartest professionals
     are watching   from banked   seating on a scaffolding
     frame.

     Jamal and a couple of street kids slip under the
     scaffolding supporting the banked seats. The street
     kids are trying to reach the hand-bags of the women
     above them.

                             BOY

               no panties on over here.

     Jamal reaches up and easily lifts a wallet from a man's
     trouser pocket. On stage, the actors start singing.
     Jamal seems to have forgotten the wallet and stares,
     mesmerised, at the stage.

                             WOMAN
               Why don't you put it back and
               listen to the music?

     Jamal starts, makes to run, but the woman who spoke
     holds out a cigarette. A Canadian back-packer is
     sitting, staring at the singers.

     Salim, Shankar, Jamal and the Taj Gang are gathered
     around a campfire. All of them wear extraordinary foot-
     wear of one form or another, from elaborate high heels
     to walking boots five sizes too large. A home-made
     hooka pipe is being passed around the fire. The eyes of
     the children have long since stopped focussing. Salim
     is sporting a Mercedes Benz badge on a chain around his
     neck. Behind him, Jamal appears, his face swollen. He
     takes off his fake Guide's Badge and throws it in the
     fire.

      On the tiny landing, Salim and Jamal pull back a
      curtain to reveal a humping couple. They move on, past
      more women lying on their beds or blankly having sex,
      not in the least perturbed to be interrupted. They
      reach the end of the landing. From the other side of
      the door comes the filmi music. Jamal puts his eye to
      one of the gaps in the slatted door. Through it he can
      see glimpses of a girl dancing to the music. Latika;
      though not the rag-picker of before. Now fifteen, she
      is a beautiful young woman and dressed in a revealing,
      turquoise, silk sari.

                                 SALIM
                   Is it her or not?

      He shoves Jamal out of the way and watches.

                   Shit, she's sexy, man....

      Then the music stops, an effeminate man steps into the
      limited frame Salim can see and snaps a stick down hard
      on Latika's hand.

                                 DANCE TEACHER
                   Smile! Flow, flow! You entice
                   with the hands not make
                   chapattis, you gawaar. Again.

      The man starts the music again and Latika's hands flow
      elegantly around her head.

                                   JAMAL
                   Come. Quick.

      But Latika remains fixed.

                                 DANCE TEACHER
                   You silly little boys. Get out
                   now while you can.

                                   JAMAL
                   Come with us.

      Latika runs to Jamal. But she freezes as she looks at
      the doorway. Maman, Punnoose and the Woman from
      downstairs stand there. The skin around Punnoose's eye
      bears the blisters from the chloroform burn years ago.

                                 MAMAN
                   Look who we have here, Punnoose.
                   Hello again, Jamal. Salim. Never
                   forget a face. Especially one
                   that I own.

                   Shall I take them to the

                   Just make sure that you dispose
                   of them properly afterwards. No

      He turns to Jamal.

                                 MAMAN (CONT'D)
                   You really thought you could
                   just walk in and take my prize
                   away? Have you any idea how much
                   this little virgin is worth,
                   bhen chod?

      He fingers Latika's hair.

                                 MAMAN (CONT'D)
                   Get them out of here.

      Punnoose and the Muscle walk towards Jamal. Maman turns
      to the Dance Teacher as they grab his arms.

                                 MAMAN (CONT'D)
                   Please continue, Master-ji.

      The Dance Teacher puts the music back on.

                You can have money. Here.

      Maman gets out his wallet and throws all the money in

                              MAMAN (CONT'D)
                Take it. Go. Disappear with your
                friend and we'll forget all
                about this. Okay?

      Salim collects up the money.

                              SALIM
                Maman never forgets. Isn't that
                right?

                              MAMAN
                Oh, Maman can make an exception.

      Salim walks over to the music, turns it up. Picks up a
      cushion from the bed and walks right up to Maman.

                              SALIM
                Can't take that risk, Maman.
                Sorry.

      He wraps the cushion around the gun and pulls the
      trigger. Or tries to. Nothing happens. There is a
      frozen moment as they watch him fail to shoot.
      Everybody watches with surreal interest as Salim
      fumbles with the pistol. Eventually he looks up,
      giggles stupidly.

                                SALIM (CONT'D)
                Safety catch.

      Shrugs apologetically and shoots. Nobody is more
      surprised than Maman who crumples onto the floor.

                   rupees but, not content with

       A cheek scarred by disfiguring knife scars. Pulling
       back we see it is Latika, staring frozen at Jamal on
       the television news. A palatial living room. Dealing
       cards to Salim, is Javed Khan. A couple of Bar Girls
       giggle next to Javed and a couple of his Thugs. Pouring
       drinks at a sideboard is Latika. Javed glances up at
       the screen, clearly not recognising Jamal on a clip
       from Who Wants to be a Millionaire. Salim, too is
       staring, wide-eyed at the tv. Javed picks up the
       remote, doesn't even notice and switches over to a
       music channel. Latika hurries out.

       He motions Salim to get him a drink. Javed's mobile
       rings as Salim goes over to the sideboard. Shifts a
       bottle to the back.

       the same one he threw in there months ago. Salim stares

       phone.

                 Welcome back to Who Wants to be

                 from Mumbai has already won one
                 Crore rupees, a cool ten

      Jamal forces himself through the people. Nothing will
      stop him. Latika too is shoving them aside until they
      are face-to-face. They stop, look at each other, hold
      each other's hands tight. The whole station seems
      frozen, the only movement from a thousand bodies being
      Jamal and Latika.

                   I knew you'd be watching.

      Jamal puts his hand on Latika's chin, turns her head
      gently so that she is facing him. He sees the knife
      scars on her cheek for the first time. She tries to
      turn her head, but he won't let her. Runs his hand
      slowly down the scar. Rests his hand there.

                                 JAMAL (CONT'D)

Good to meet you Jack. Are you of the Boston Dawsons?

No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.

J.J. nods as if he's heard of them, then looks puzzled. Madeleine Astor

Like a ballroom at the palace, alive and lit by a constellation of

move across the room to their table, Cal and Ruth beside them, we hear...

He must have been nervous but he never faltered. They assumed he was one of

still a memeber of the club. Mother of course, could always be counted
upon...

MOVING WITH ROSE as she goes up the sweeping staircase toward him. He
turns, sees her... smiles.

Crow led and alive with music, laughter and raucous carrying on. An ad hoc
band is gathered near the upright piano, honking out lively stomping music
on fiddle, accoridon and tambourine. People of all ages are dancing,
drinking beer and wine, smoking, laughing, even brawling.

Tommy hands Rose a pint of stout and she hoists it. Jack meanwhile dances
with 5 year old Cora Cartmell, or tries to, with her standing on his feet.
As the tune ends, Rose leans down to the little girl.

                                   ROSE

May I cut in, miss?

                                   JACK

You're still my best girl, Cora.

Cora scampers off. Rose and Jack face each other. She is trembling as he
takes her right hand in his left. His other hand slides to the small of her
back. It is an electrifying moment.

                                   ROSE

I don't know the steps.

                                   JACK

Just move with me. Don't think.

The music starts and they are off. A little awkward at first, she starts to
get into it. She grins at Jack as she starts to get the rhythm of the
steops.

Jack, Rose et al burst out onto the boat deck from the crew stairs just aft
of the third funnel. They look at the empty davits.

She sees Colonel Gracie chugging forward along the deck, escorting two
first class ladies.

Jack grabs her hand and they sprint past Gracie, with Tommy and Fabrizio
close behind.

NOTE: There are four so-called collapsibles, or Engelhardts boats,
including two which are stored on the roof of the officer's quarters.

The crowd is sparse, with most people still aft. Cal slips his hand out of
hte pocket of his overcoat and into the waist pocket of Murdoch's
greatcoat, leaving the stacks of bills there.

Mir One returning to surface.

Lovett stands at the rail, looking down into the black water. Lizzy comes

As he takes a hit   on   the flask, Max's eye focuses on the
little mirror on   the   dash. In it he can see Manubai's
eyes. If we  were   to   judge by what he sees in them, she
doesn't find him   the   least bit amusing. He smiles his
smile at her.

A huge bridge dominates the skyline. The train     trundles

flowing into the station, clearing a view for us    of the
Pals, clinging to their baggage in the middle of    this
human anthill.

Hasari looks at the tiny space. The roof is cardboard

food, debates a moment... then puts his hands together,
addresses these generous people.
                       HASARI

children sleep despite the QUIET MOANS and nightmare
CRIES around them, the two boys huddled together, Amrita

Hasari comes out of the dark. Aloka looks at him. He
shakes his head. He slumps beside her. Aloka strokes
Hasari, looking lovingly at him.
                       ALOKA
         I remember the first time I saw
         you, on the day of our marriage.
         Wearing a bright yellow turban.
         You asked me my name and you said,
         'You are a very beautiful girl
         and I am wondering whether you
         will find me appealing.'
He strokes her tenderly in return... but now, overwhelmed
with despair, she begins to weep.

         What?
She doesn't want to say it, doesn't want to wake the

We hear the BELL TINKLING as the rickshaw, pulled by

Amidst instant concern, Joan opens the envelope.   Looks
at Max. We hear the sound of BANGLADESH MUSIC.


INT. GODFATHER'S "THRONE ROOM" - OLD RADIO - DAY
The MUSIC is of days gone by, playing on an old RADIO.
Sticks of burning incense send off trails of smoke. The
godfather, MR. GHATAK, Looking infirm, wipes a tear from
his eye.
                         GHATAK
         Acha!
Now we see   Max and Joan seated on cushions before the
godfather,   tea in hand. Max catches a glimpse in an
anteroom of   several thugs with several young girls, one
of whom is   Poomina. She catches a glimpse of Max as she
disappears   past a door. A moment later, her head peeks
around the   door frame. She brings her hands together.
                         ASHOKA (O.S.)
         You!

Poomina quickly disappears.   Max's attention is pulled
back to the godfather...
                       GHATAK
         I understand that you're interested
         in expanding your clinic and free
         school, and that you intend to
         start treating lepers in the City
         of Joy.

         Your neighbors in the City of Joy,
         they're not educated, they're
         given to violence, to meanness, I
         can promise you they won't like
         having lepers among them, but
         because they know you're under my
         protection...
He dispatches a globule of spit into the copper urn next

         Doctor, do you like our music?

         Well, I can't say I've developed a
         craving for it yet.
                       GHATAK
         It's difficult to appreciate what
         we don't understand, isn't it?
         Let me put it another way: The
         world is a terrible place. Only
         the ruthless prevail. My son will
         make the arrangements with you.
One of the thugs helps the godfather outside, where, in
the b.g., we see him listening to his music and pottering
in his garden. As Max and Joan turn, Max finds himself
face to face with Ashoka, who wears Max's necklace and
chai. There's a long pause as the two of them take the
other's measure.

                (to Ashoka)
         I like your taste in neckwear.
Joan puts a cautioning hand on Max's arm. Ashoka seems
just the slight bit uneasy dealing with Max and so keeps
trying to direct himself to Joan. He smokes a long
Indian cigarette.
                       ASHOKA
         The entire package we're proposing
         will cost you three thousand rupees
         a month.
Joan is taken aback by the sum.

COURTYARD
Ashoka sits behind a little table, picking absently at
his face. The Goonda is slouched near the table, smoking
a cigarette and fiddling with a thin switch. (It's dif-
ficult for him to show Ashoka the respect his inherited
position gives him.) The Goonda has a bruise under one
eye from his altercation in the City of Joy yesterday.
The air is filled with the MUFFLED SOUNDS OF the STREET.
FROM here, we can see the evermore enfeebled godfather
in his "throne room," wrapped in a cashmere, listening
to the radio. Ashoka looks up, stares impassively at
someone.

          A man's journey to the end of his

          And you have to remember that you
          can never give up. We pray that
          life will bless us, that we will
          be kings, with possessions and
          money that we can rule over all
          around us. But it's a mist; the
          only thing that makes it possible
          to endure life is our love, one
          for the other.
A beat, the family and Max tightly bound together.   And
now we hear the dim sounds of RICKSHAW BELLS.

          I was dreaming the sound of

          them.
Max opens the windows.   Manooj helps his father sit up.

COURTYARD - THEIR POV
Outside, there are rickshaw pullers filling the courtyard
and spilling out into the street. When the window opens,
all the Pullers start ringing their bells and the room is
full of their music.
                        HASARI
          Are they here for me?
Unquestionably, they are.

          wear their letter jackets even when it's

     The tape revolves in the stereo, playing a beautiful ballad.
     Charlie watches Sam sway to his music like a serenade. Like
     she is dancing with him. But she isn't. A wider angle
     reveals that she is slow dancing with... Craig.

     Charlie is 15 year old CRUSHED. No filter. Just feeling.
     Patrick, Alice, and Mary Elizabeth watch Sam across the room.

                         ALICE
               So, what do you think?

                         PATRICK
               I don't know.
                                                                    35.


                         ALICE
               I hope it works out. Craig would be a
               big step up from her last boyfriend.

               Come on out, Charlie.

     They all chime in. "Let's go, young man!" "Charlie!
     Charlie!" Charlie opens the door off camera, and we see his
     entrance play off their faces. The reverse angle reveals...

     Charlie dressed in his suit. Like the best of English mods
     in the 60's. For those of you who know the book, this is the
     cover. They all clap. It's magic.

                          PATRICK
               Yeah!   What a display of man I have ever
               seen!

     Sam and Charlie look at each and smile.

                         CHARLIE
               Where are we going?

                         SAM
               It's a surprise.

     Sam flips the switch, bathing the room in light. Sam's room
     is so cool. A shrine to music. A xerox that says "The
     Beatings Will Continue Until Morale Improves." Virgin Mary
     icons. Snow globes. Kitsch.
                                                               42.

          Thanks.

Sam points to a green box with a red ribbon on her desk.

          You got me a present?

100   INT. MARY ELIZABETH'S DEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                    100

      Mary Elizabeth approaches Charlie on the antique sofa. She
      uncorks a bottle of wine. POP! She hands him the bottle.

                           MARY ELIZABETH
                Mmmm.   Now, let it breathe.

      Mary Elizabeth walks over to the vintage turntable. She
      turns on the gas fireplace with a remote control. Roar!

                          CHARLIE
                This is sure a nice house.

                            MARY ELIZABETH
                Thanks.

      Mary Elizabeth drops the needle on a vinyl LP. A Doo Wop
      make-out classic begins to play. She dances over to Charlie.

                          MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                Mmmm. Don't you just love old music?
                    (off his nod)
                Good. Because I made you a mix of it.
                I'd love to expose you to great things.
                Like Billie Holiday and foreign films.

      She pours the wine.   Charlie looks at the bottle.

                          CHARLIE
                This merlot is really fancy.

                          MARY ELIZABETH
                Yeah. My dad collects wine, but he
                doesn't drink. That's weird, isn't it?

                            CHARLIE
                I guess.    Where are your parents?

                          MARY ELIZABETH
                Their club is hosting a cotillion or
                something racist. They'll be gone all
                night.

      Mary Elizabeth drops her necklace with a thud.   Charlie looks
      around. Heart beating.

      Charlie tries not to feel Mary Elizabeth's sweaty hand.

                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
                And I tried not to mind that she loves to

      Just like Sadie's except... the fire in the fireplace is out.
      We move from the fireplace to Charlie, touching Mary
      Elizabeth's breasts over her sweater.

                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
                And I had to admit something really
                upsetting. But I am tired of touching
                her boobs. I thought maybe if she would
                just let me pick the make-out music once
                in awhile, we might have a chance.

      Charlie looks at the Ani DiFranco Mix on the stereo.   Sighs.

                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
                And maybe if she didn't put down the
                books that Mr. Anderson gives me.

                          MARY ELIZABETH
                Walden? I read it in 7th grade.    I would
                have called it "On Boring Pond."

      clock. 3:13pm. His voice can no longer hide his quiet rage.

                going to the University of Washington

                But he wasn't going to leave without
                organizing the best senior prank ever.

      The shop teacher, Mr. Callahan stares at the wall, furious.
      As the students gawk, Charlie smiles to himself.

                Well, can I tell you something? I've

          Dillinger finishes his drink, approaches. He now sees how
          beautiful Billie is. She's 5 foot 5. With a straight erect
          build, she stands out in any crowd. She looks Dillinger
          straight in the eye. Clear skin, dark eyes with humor playing
          about the edges. He unexpectedly starts to feel nervous.
          He gives her his best grin.

          great smile. And, paradoxes: he easily talks to women but
          he's not a hustler. He's young, but there's a world of
          experience in his face. Open, but he's holding something

              (shoots Rick with finger)
          I sentence you to... dance for us in
          today's post-meeting version of "Out of
          Limits" featuring the musical stylings of
          the CBP Stompers.

Everyone cheers.

                       RICK
          Aw, Chuck.

                    BARRIS
          Get up here, you rascule, you.

Rick heads up to Barris's desk. Everyone laughs. A few
employees have joined Barris at his desk with instruments.
They break into a raucous banjo version of "Out of Limits."
Rick dances. Everyone's laughing and clapping.

MONTAGE

As "Out of Limits" continues, now the actual version, we see
montage of Barris shooting, stabbing, and garroting various
foreign-looking people in strange, murky locations intercut
with Barris having sex with Patricia Watson in different
bedrooms and motel rooms, Barris dancing with Patricia in
various exotic locales, and Barris on the set for his many
game shows, happily directing the bustling activity.

       INT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

       Eric's flat consists of a good sized living room area with a 
       connected kitchen and a small bedroom in the back.  In the 
       front of the living room there is a small balcony where the 
       sounds of the city pour in.  The room itself is a general 
       mess.  A bunch of guns are piled in one corner of the floor.  
       Hung up on the wall is a huge, French "Dressed To Kill" 
       poster.

       Some Brazilian Gilberto/Getz music is playing.

       Sitting at the table playing cards are three men:  FRANCOIS, 
       RICARDO, and JEAN.

       Sitting on the couch rolling a cigarette with hash is CLAUDE 
       and OLIVER.

       They all turn as Zed and Eric walk in.

                           ERIC
                 Hello.

       They all return the greeting.

       An old wine cellar has been converted into a Toy Jazz club.  
       Nothing fancy...dirt floors, chairs and small tables

       great acoustics.

       ON STAGE

       a BAND is playing away.  In the audience sit about TWELVE 
       FRENCH PEOPLE, all enjoying the music.

       In the back of the club near the doors some tables have been

                 Yeah...I guess.

                           OLIVER
                 I love it.  It's really good, you know?  
                 Like real music.  It has a heart and 
                 culture all it's own.  It's, like, jazz 
                 for dwarves...or guys in Leiderhosen.  
                 Total purity of essence.

                 Here, you must drink some of this wine,

       good or not.

       ON STAGE

       Suddenly, it seems as though the bands music gets louder.  
       The horns really start to scream and the room becomes a 
       delirium of music.

       The band stands up.

       IN THE AUDIENCE

       The people watching start to dance, if not in their seats

       And surely he must be, yet, in a strange way, he's keeping up 
       with the other musicians and sounding pretty good.

       Eric is all smile as he plays with them.  Sweat is running 
       down his face but he's caught up in the moment.

       ELISE, a woman from the audience has jumped up onto the 
       stage, caught up in Eric's frenzy, and is dancing about like

       Then, the music crescendos and Eric hands the trombone back

       Eric, Zed, Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Claude, and Oliver are 
       all walking down some dank stone steps into a cellar.  
       Somewhere crazy Raymond Scott Toy Jazz music is playing.

       An old wine cellar has been converted into a Toy Jazz club.  
       Nothing fancy...dirt floors, chairs and small tables 
       scattered about...but the arched brick ceilings make for 
       great acoustics.

       ON STAGE

       a BAND is playing away.  In the audience sit about TWELVE 
       FRENCH PEOPLE, all enjoying the music.

       AT THE BUFFET

       In the back of the club near the doors some tables have been 
       set up with a buffet of local cuisine on it.  Behind the 
       tables are two rotund but happy French women MIRELLE and 
       JOSEPHINE.

       Eric, Zed, Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Claude, and Oliver walk 
       in and immediately start blabbing away in French to Mirelle

                 Yeah...I guess.

                           OLIVER
                 I love it.  It's really good, you know?  
                 Like real music.  It has a heart and 
                 culture all it's own.  It's, like, jazz 
                 for dwarves...or guys in Leiderhosen.  
                 Total purity of essence.

                           ZED
                 Yeah.

       good or not.

       ON STAGE

       Suddenly, it seems as though the bands music gets louder.  
       The horns really start to scream and the room becomes a 
       delirium of music.

       The band stands up.

       IN THE AUDIENCE

       The people watching start to dance, if not in their seats

As Guy enters. There are the usual counters and shelves,

     number. Sara gets a sinking feeling that drops like a
     stone when she looks across the street. Roy's parked at
     the curb, waiting for her. She rolls her eyes and he
     HONKS AGAIN. Then he waves at her. Waves! Chenille
     looks at Sara. Then at Roy.

                                CHENILLE
                  That's your old man? Now he's
                  cute.

                                SARA
                  He's embarrassing.

                                 CHENILLE
                          (laughs)

     Sara climbs in, slams the door. Roy looks over at her,
     unaware of how annoyed she is with him. She's a clenched
     fist inside.

     The Man grins, opens the rope, lets them in -- "in" being

     back with a smirk.

     Asian guy with a multi-colored Mohawk. One slips Mohawk
     a packet of coke, the other takes his money. WIDER as

     complain. He just starts swinging.

     The MUSIC changes and their dance ends. They stand there
     for a moment, a little caught up in each other. A little
     unsure of the moment. And then there's a scream!
     Several of them actually. Patrick reacts to it
     instinctively. Looking around. In a small pocket of the
     club he sees Malakai.

          A festive Parisian night spot. Dance MUSIC plays while a floor show, lit by 
          moving spotlights, unfurls in the huge, darkened ballroom which is ringed with 
          crowded tables. A handsome male dancer, in tuxedo and top hat, whirls 
          exuberantly around the floor, surrounded by beautiful chorus girls. 
          
          Somewhere above all this, Nikki, lit by spotlight flashes, sits on the edge of 
          a ringside balcony observing the show with eager interest through her 
          lorgnette.
          
          The show continues: after a few twirls, the dancer links arms with the girls 
          to form a line and do some precision high-kicking. The music continues but the 
          dance apparently ends and the lights come up. Impressed, Nikki is breathless.  
          
          				NIKKI
          		My, my! Isn't this nice?!
          
          Nearby, the men sit at a roped-off table for six on a low balcony. Cary and 
          Francis sit glumly on one side of the table as Bill tries to tell a story to 
          the others (Frink; a nameless young woman nicknamed "Kiss-Me-Quick" who 
          appears in this scene only; Shep and Nikki).

          sits on the edge of his own bed opposite Shep's, picks up a party horn and 
          blows into it, hard. The horn SQUEALS horribly. Shep wakes with a start and

          hands, picks up a bottle.

          BEHIND THE CARNIVAL BUILDINGS
          on a dark, deserted street. Distant crowd NOISE and carnival MUSIC drifts in. 
          Under the light of a street lamp on the edge of the carnival, Francis strolls 
          casually into view and swings a leg over a slackly hung boundary rope, pausing 
          to glance backward. He sees ...
          
          ... Cary, Shep and Nikki as they round the corner and pause, a little 
          breathless, to lean against a wall. Shep, his fist still at his side, slumps

          steps over the rope and, pulling his jacket collar up around his neck, walks 
          off, instantly swallowed up by the darkness.
          
          Cary and Nikki stare after him, astonished.

          The sweet silence of slumber. Suddenly, an alarm clock on a
          nightstand SHRIEKS the operatic tones of Maria Callas.
          
          A well-manicured hand, nails painted pink, slaps the snooze
          button and mutes Maria. A few seconds reprieve.
          
          Then, another clock, stationed on a dresser, broadcasts the
          FORTISSIMO POUNDING of the "William Tell Overture." Toes,
          also painted pink, swing out of bed and run to the dresser.
          
          LETTY MAYER, late 20s and beautiful, turns off the music.
          She opens a dresser drawer and surveys panties that are
          arranged by color, from white to beige to black. Behind the
          panties are rows of bras, also organized by color. Letty
          pulls out some taupe undergarments, checks them against her
          nails and replaces them in favor of a pink bra and panties.
          
          Letty goes to her closet and removes a tailored, pink linen
          suit. She lays it on the bed. Beast, her cat, jumps on the
          bed and settles into the jacket. Letty swoops the animal off
          her clothes and brushes cat hair from the suit.

                     you about linen?
          
          The scolding is cut short by an "Urge Overkill" song that
          SCREAMS OUT from another room. On cue, Letty heads down the
          hall, dressing as she goes. She CLUCKS for Beast to follow.

EXT. PENNSYLVANIA STEEL MILL - LIGHT SNOW - DAY

The plant is massive, grime-streaked, squatting in the valley
under five massive stacks, each one trailing a black ribbon
across the winter sky. Fires can be seen flickering through
the windows and long flames weave and dance from the tops of
guyed metal flues. Steam rises in clouds from vents and
chimneys and the sound of it all -- the hissing, the
clanging, the rumbling, the shrieking -- comes faintly, muted
by the falling snow.

In the foreground is a street -- COLUMBINE STREET -- which
inhabits the bottom of a narrow ravine and plunges directly
down the hillside, straight at the mill. Columbine is a sad
looking street, a grim-looking street, a street hanging on by
the skin of its teeth. Dilapidated stores hug the narrow
sidewalks. Battered signs squeak in the wind. Sandwiched
between the stores and scattered on twisting roads along the
hillside are narrow Victorian houses. These houses, which run
to three stories or more in height, all seem on the verge of
toppling over, and undoubtedly would, except that they are
all connected one to another by a mad arrangement of utility
lines which cross and re-cross between them with occasional
aid from a leaning pole.

MUSIC COMES UP -- dissonant, rather frightening music -- as
we watch a car come charging up through the slush on
Columbine Street. As it nears CAMERA the car falters on the
slippery grade and slides out of sight. A figure appears,
huddled against the driving snow. The figure disappears AS
CAMERA HOLDS ON THE STEEL MILL AT THE END OF THE EMPTY
STREET.

LINDA'S FATHER swings at her again, loses his balance and
falls on the floor. LINDA stands looking at him, holding her
jaw. She is crying. Tears are streaming down her face. 

EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - TOP OF HILL - DAY

Seven MUSICIANS, carrying their instruments, file silently
through the falling snow.

EXT. ALLEY BEHIND JOHN'S BAR - DAY

The WOMEN are all gathered, some fifteen or twenty, ranging
from grandmothers to young wives. About half of them wield
rolling pins or heavy pans. As the last reinforcements arrive
-- TWO HEFTY LADIES WITH TRUNCHEONS -- a roar of laughter
comes from inside.

INT. JOHN'S BAR - DAY

NICK, SAL, MERLE, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN are dancing. The
MUSIC is at top volume and the smoke is thick enough to cut
with a knife. Suddenly, from the back, comes a CHORUS OF
SCREECHES AND FEMALE RECRIMINATIONS. The door to the alley
bursts open and the HEFTY LADIES WITH TRUNCHEONS appear. The
STEELWORKERS take one look, gulp their drinks, grab their
heads in their hands and rush for the front door.

EXT. JOHN'S BAR - FRONT ENTRANCE - DAY

The STEELWORKERS stream into the snow with the WOMEN close
behind. Several blows are delivered and the howls of
complaint are met with angry commands to hurry and get
dressed for Sal's wedding.

CAMERA CLOSES ON SAL, who emerges with NICK and MERLE. The
snow hits him a sobering blow and he comes to a stop.

			SAL 
	Boy, this is it. This is really
	it... I mean... here I go.

SAL'S MOTHER hurries out of the alley. She is crying.

			SAL'S MOTHER 
	My beautiful boy! My angel... who
	is leaving his own mother.

She throws herself in SAL's arms, sobbing.

INT. V.F.W. POST - COATROOM - NIGHT

The rack is still jammed with COUPLES but the laughing and
giggling has now given way to the sound of heavy breathing
and low moans.
What light there is comes from the colored glass ball
revolving above the dance floor, where the MUSIC is now
playing sweet and low.

The front door comes open and a U.S. Army SERGEANT steps into
the darkened hallway. The man wears his dress green uniform.
On his chest is a row of battle ribbons and his shoes are
brightly polished.

			SERGEANT
	Pow!

The SERGEANT gives a beery chuckle and moves toward the dance
floor.

INT. V.F.W. POST - TRESTLE TABLE AREA - NIGHT

The SERGEANT passes between groups of celebrating GUESTS,
plucks a beer from one of the coolers and sits down alone at
the end of one of the white trestle tables.

INT. V.F.W. POST - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

ALBERT gives his Tarzan cry, suddenly picks his GIRL off her
feet and marches around holding her above his head.

INT. V.F.W. POST - NIGHT

The GUESTS have formed in a long double line which extends
from the dance floor right out into the street. Everyone is
pretty drunk and they are all armed with streamers and bags
of rice. As SAL and ANGELA appear from out of a back room
there is a great rowdy CHEER. The MUSICIANS strike up a
MARCH. Followed by the MUSICIANS, showered with streamers,
rice, advice and encouragement, SAL and ANGELA walk the
gauntlet toward the street, where a glossy, bright red
Pontiac with headers and straight pipes is being revved in a
series of ear-splitting crescendos.

EXT. V.F.W. POST - STREET - NIGHT

JOHN, ALBERT, MERLE and VINCENT are standing by the door.
Their tuxedos are stained and torn. Their carnations are
squashed and their clip-on bow ties are either missing
entirely or dangling from the open collars of their shirts.
VINCE looks the worst, with a black eye and half his pant leg
torn away, and they are all guzzling beer.

			VINCE 
	Bullshit! That's bullshit!

CAMERA HOLDS ON NICK as he turns out of the line and heads
for the exit under a long row of CLOCKS.

EXT. BUSY STREET - SAIGON - DAY

NICK comes along the sidewalk in a CROWD OF PEDESTRIANS. He
is drunk and he moves aimlessly, as if he had been drifting
along for hours. As he comes to a stop, staring at a SOUTH
VIETNAMESE who has lost both legs, he fumbles in his pocket
for a pint of whiskey, empties the bottle and drops it in the
gutter. Suddenly, across the street, something catches his
eye.

			NICK 
		(calling)
	Sal...! Sal!!!

NICK throws himself into the traffic, headlong, without even
looking.

Vehicles swerve and screech to a stop. NICK dodges between
them, gains the sidewalk on the other side and claps his hand
on the back of a passing SOLDIER. The SOLDIER turns. It is
not SAL at all and the resemblance is not even close.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Sorry... Thought you were someone
	else.

The SOLDIER continues on his way. The CROWD streams on, a sea
of bobbing, brilliant color. NICK gropes in his pocket and
produces another pint bottle. He unscrews the cap and downs a
long swallow.

INT. BAR - SAIGON - NIGHT

The place is very dark. LOUD MUSIC is playing. Partially-clad
BAR GIRLS are dancing with the CUSTOMERS, while above, on a
kind of trapeze, NAKED GIRLS are performing obscene
contortions.

NICK sits at one of the tables. By now he is very drunk and a
BAR GIRL is giving him her undivided attention.

			NICK 
	I love Linda, see. I love Linda
	more than I can even say.

			BAR GIRL 
	Everybody love Linda.

			NICK 
	That's right. That's exactly what I
	mean!

			BAR GIRL 
	I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda

82   INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT                               82

     The place is far cry from Vanger's manor. It's modern.
     Martin, Liv and Blomkvist work on the dinner Martin has
     prepared. Soft jazz music issues from somewhere.

               I used to work in the company's
               petrochemical division in Goteborg.
               When it was sold, I went with it.

               I live in Hong Kong now, but come
               back to Stockholm for family events,
               and when I do, I drive up to spend a
               couple days with Martin.

          for dear life. He looks up to discover the Giant climbing
          down after him; Jack feverishly picks up speed and jumps the
          last six feet to the ground. He quickly drops the harp and
          runs to a large axe embedded in the stump of a tree.

            on his bed.  The KNOCK on the door is barely heard.  ANOTHER
            KNOCK draws his disapproval.

                                GEORGE (O.S.)
                      Sam!

            Sam's face turns sour as he yanks the door open.

                                GEORGE (CONT'D)
                      Ready?

            Sam shrugs and returns to finish his packing.

                                GEORGE (CONT'D)
                      I think you'll have fun this summer.

            It's nearly impossible to hear George over the music.

                                GEORGE (CONT'D)
                      Don't forget your headphones.

            The music is quickly driving George crazy.

                                GEORGE (CONT'D)
                      Would you mind turning it down?

            This doesn't register with Sam.

                                GEORGE (CONT'D)
                      It won't all be work, you know?

            George is once again, seemingly unheard.  He walks to within
            inches of Sam and grabs his head and yells into Sam's ear.

                                GEORGE (CONT'D)
                      It won't be all work, you know!

            Sam pulls away from the touch and turns the music off.

            George walks to the sliding glass door and stares down at the
            boys and Robin in the pool.

                      It's about time this shack is torn down.

            Barbara appears surprised as George turns to face them - she
            obviously didn't realize he was the one up on the roof doing
            the demolition.

                                TOM
                      Oh, hello George.

                                GEORGE
                      Guess how many low-income apartments the
                      city approved for this lot?

            Tom and Barbara react by trying not to react.

                                GEORGE (CONT'D)
                      Come on...ballpark figure.

            Tom and Barbara step back and walk away.  George heads to the
            ladder and climbs down.

            ANOTHER VIEW

            Sam is grooving to the music with his eyes closed as George's
            hand, filled with a gob of sunscreen, plops onto Sam's
            stomach.  Sam bolts up from the chaise lounge in a rage.

                                SAM
                      What are you doing?!

                                GEORGE
                      I warned you yesterday.

                                SAM

            Alyssa walks across her lawn to the feuding family.  George
            holds out the bottle of sun lotion to Alyssa.

                      Since seventh grade.

                                GEORGE
                      Tell him how you made me fall in love
                      with you.

                                ROBIN
                      I smiled at him.

                                GEORGE
                      Watch out for the smile, boys.

            Robin's body moves slightly to the music as she smiles. 
            George grins.  The boys aren't sure what to make of the
            advice.  'You are the beautiful love (my lover), I am the
            distant shore (so far away).  There is so much to uncover
            (love's hiding).  What is this distance for?  What is it for?

                                ROBIN
                      Who's up for a dance?

            Robin glances around for any takers, finally focusing on
            George.

                                ADAM (O.S.)
                      Just don't hug me too tight.

            Adam walks to his mother and they hold hands as they dance. 
            Sam sits down to watch.  George wears a smile that wipes the
            last of the pain from his face.

                                ADAM (CONT'D)
                      That's all you get.  I'm busy today.

            Adam backs away and grabs his paintbrush.  Robin stops
            dancing as she focuses on George.

                                ROBIN
                      Let's see if you've gotten any better.

                      Oh, I'm worse.  Much, much worse.

            Robin waits to see how worse.  George finally walks to her
            and takes her in his arms.  He must have been better than
            this.  The waltz smooths out as they dance closer, holding
            tighter.  "We fill the air with silent stares.  But still, no
            one there, we are strangers."  Alyssa decides it's time to
            go.

                                ALYSSA
                      I'll see you tomorrow.

            Sam watches Alyssa walk away, but he's quickly drawn back to
            his mother and father dancing.  Ryan appears anxious, unsure
            of the music and George.

                                RYAN
                      When did you fall in love with my dad?

            The dance stops.  George lets go of Robin as she focuses on
            Ryan.

                                ROBIN
                      When I found out I was pregnant with you.

            INT. GEORGE'S GARAGE - NIGHT

            Sam is on the pull out bed, listening to music through head
            phones.  We HEAR a flush, the armoire doors open and George
            walks out of the cabinet, washes his hands, turns off the
            light and drops into bed.  A nightlight stuck in a socket
            above the bed casts a dull blue light over the room.  Sam
            takes the headphones off.  After a long silence:

                                SAM
                      I took some of your Vicodin.

                                GEORGE
                      I know.
                          (beat)
                      Why?

                      I like how it feels not to feel.

            George turns onto his side to face his son.

                                GEORGE
                      I know the feeling.

            Sam slips his headphones back on.  George nods...it is.

            EXT. DAVID DOKOS' HOUSE - MORNING

            Guster is squatting on the lush lawn of the mansion taking a
            dump.  David bursts out from his house, rushes to his black
            Mercedes and tries once again to run over Guster.  No such
            luck.  Guster moves on to another lawn as Mr. Dokos drops
            over the curb and drives off down the street.

            EXT. GEORGE'S BEACH SHACK - AFTERNOON

            In the late June afternoon, with a clotted cloud sky, Robin,
            Adam, Ryan, Sam, Alyssa and George work at building a house. 
            Adam and Ryan are staining the interior doors they stripped
            days earlier.  George and Sam carry large wood beam to the
            foundation and slip it into the pocket mortise of the
            laminated beam that spans from pier post to pier post.  Robin
            grabs a drill and screws the cast-in tie down to the wood
            beam.  Alyssa is sawing a rafter in half as her mother walks
            across the grass with a huge basket of food.

                                COLLEEN
                      Is anyone hungry?

            LATER

            With MUSIC playing in the background, everyone is packed
            around the patio table eating pasta and drinking lemonade.

                                ADAM
                      I like the color I'm making the doors.

                                GEORGE
                      The absolute best color I've ever seen in
                      my life.

            Adam lights up, pleased to be praised.

                                RYAN

                      He's not the type to worry.

            Robin is slightly pissed at Alyssa grilling her; she flips
            the hamburgers and calls out:

                                ROBIN (CONT'D)

            INT. WEBBER'S LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

            Music is playing softly in the background.  Peter is sitting
            alone in a chair with a drink in hand.  After a bit, Lois
            walks in holding a can of Pledge and a rag.

                                LOIS
                      I'd be glad to fix you something.

                                PETER
                      No, I'm fine.

            Lois nods and walks away.  For all the presence of the room,
            Peter looks small and frayed in it - lost in his own house.

            Lunch is over.  Adam is wrestling with Guster on the lawn. 
            Robin is taking money from her purse as George hands Sam the
            keys to his truck.

                                ROBIN

                      So could I.

            George touches Robin's chin, draws her head up.  He stares at
            her, afraid to say what he needs to say.

                                ROBIN
                      Are you going to kiss me?

                      It's not my back that's killing me.

            Robin furrows her brow, not understanding.  George surrounds
            her head with his hands and kisses her forehead.

            EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - MORNING

            Adam and Ryan are helping Dale run the electrical lines;
            Alyssa and Sam drill screws into the second story
            floorboards.  MUSIC is playing loud on the radio.

            Josh stops peddling quite a distance from George's house and
            gets off to search for Alyssa.  Only seeing Adam, Ryan and
            Dale, Josh pulls out his cell and dials.

          he forces one of the fish-hooks through Suzy's earlobe. Suzy
          screams murderously. Sam releases her. The beetle dangles
          neatly. A line of blood runs down the side of Suzy's neck.
          Sam holds up a little mirror. Suzy nods.
                         
                          SUZY
           It's pretty. Do the other one.
                         
          Sam switches to Suzy's other earlobe. She resumes her
          screaming.

          Sam and Suzy standing on the beach listening to the French
          singer's record. They face each other, bobbing their heads
          and tilting awkwardly to the music. Suzy eventually begins to
          dance. Sam does something vaguely like the Twist. They press
          against each other and kiss. Suzy says quietly:
                         
                          SUZY
           It feels hard.

He runs over to the door, opens it, shoves her over, and

incredible rapid pace.

            Hi, I'm Bonnie Parker.  Please to
            meet you.

EXT. ROAD.  DAY.

VROOM!  The car zooms off down the road, doing 90.  The fast
country breakdown music starts up on the sound track, going
just as fast as the car.

EXT. CAR.  DAY.

The car, still speeding, further down the road.  We zoom
down and look in the rear window.  CLYDE is driving, we see
from behind.  BONNIE is all over him, biting his ear,
ruffling his hair, running her hands all over him--in short,
making passionate love to him while he drives.  The thrill
of the robbery and the escape has turned her on sexually.

EXT. CAR.  ANOTHER ANGLE.  DAY.

The camera pulls back and above the car.  The car starts to
go crazy in a comical fashion, manifesting to the audience
just what is happening to the driver controlling it.  The
car swerves all over the road.  The car comes to a sudden
halt.  The car starts again.  It swerves this time almost
right off the road before it straightens out.  It jumps and
jerks.  Another car comes down the road the other way and
CLYDE's car swerves so much as to make the other guy drive
right off the road into the dirt.  It is almost Mack Sennett
stuff, but not quite that much.

INT. CAR.  BONNIE AND CLYDE.  DAY.

BONNIE grabs the wheel and turns it sharply.

EXT. CAR.  DAY.

It hairpins off the road onto a shoulder beneath some trees.

            Sure, drive with one eye shut.

BONNIE gets in the car, rummages around in one of the bags
and pulls out something wrapped in tissue paper.  She
unwraps it and puts it up on the dashboard, displaying it.
It is a little porcelain shepherdess holding a crook in her
hand, worth about thirty cents.

                                                          123.


                         BONNIE
                   (admiring it)
            Isn't that the prettiest thing, hon?
            Just look here, you can see every
            little fingernail on her hands.

She shows him.

                         CLYDE
            It is a pretty thing, honey.

CLYDE turns on the radio and gets some hillbilly music.
They are singing "Little Church in the Valley."  He beats
time on the steering wheel, getting a little impatient.
BONNIE puts her shepherdess away and begins looking in the
grocery sack.

                         BONNIE
            We got any peaches?  I sure could
            go for a peach right now.

She burrows in the bag and comes out with a peach.  She
takes a big bite.  The juice drips down the side of her
mouth.  She looks beautiful.

                         CLYDE
                   (he stops drumming
                   his fingers, suddenly
                   has an idea)
            Whyn't we do it tomorrow?

                         BONNIE
            Do what?

                         CLYDE
            Tomorrow's Sunday, ain't it?  We
            could drive all night and be on
            that golf course tomorrow morning!

            He'll be here.
                   (holding the peach to him)
            You take a bite, hon.

                         CLYDE
                   (getting worried)
            No, it's takin' too long.  What if
            something happened?

                         BONNIE
            Nothin' happened.

                   (more urgently)
            Go take a look, see what's keepin'
            him.

Not too delighted with the chore, BONNIE goes off.  We
remain with CLYDE, getting anxious.  The music plays on.
BONNIE comes back, hurriedly, now anxious herself.

                         BONNIE
            He ain't there.

CLYDE jumps into action, slams his door.

                         CLYDE
            C'mon, let's go.

BONNIE gets in.  They drive off.

INT. STORE.  CLOSE-UP C.W.  DAY.

--hiding inside a store, peering out through a curtained
window at them driving away.  His expression is disturbed;
his face half in shadow.

EXT. ROAD.  DAY.

BONNIE and CLYDE's car coming down the road.  Camera sees
from CLYDE's P.O.V.  MALCOLM standing in the road, waving
him down.  The pickup truck, its back jacked up, is parked
beside him on a shoulder of the road.

EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH GYM - NIGHT (NOVEMBER, 1985)

ROCK MUSIC drifts out open doors -- barely recognizable as
"Born in the U.S.A." Students hang. Brains, preps,
richies, heavy metals, jocks, punk rockers, goths, geeks.
Mixing without mixing. Most are red-eyed, woozy, wasted.
A couple of boys break dance to a BOOM BOX.

Missing are the criminals...

A shiny T-top CAMARO ROARS up. Stops, TIRES SQUEALING.
VAN HALEN BLASTING. LANDON, 18, at the wheel. He is
impulsive, sexy-troubled, with the nothing-to-lose courage
to act on destructive whims. He is envied, copied,
feared.


INT. CAMARO

EMPTIES roll and CLINK on the floor. A tiny plastic
skeleton dances as it hangs from the rearview mirror.
Landon stamps a joint into the ashtray.

A small group of students sit on stage reading from Our

she's asleep. Pulls her sweater over her.


INT. JEFFERSON HIGH - LIBRARY - SATURDAY MORNING

Landon sits with Luis; Jamie at the next table with
Isabel. She looks pale. He catches her eye. They both
smile, a little sadly, then turn back to their students.

No response.

                           LANDON
            You hungry?

                           JAMIE

          Or dancing.

He turns on the CLOCK RADIO next to her bed. Finds a
WALTZ. Offers his hand. Pulls her out of bed. She's in
pajamas.

                        JAMIE
          You know how to waltz??

                        LANDON
                 (bashful)
          I was going to fake it.

                        JAMIE
          I always fake it.

So they waltz, faking, stumbling and laughing, holding
each other.

Reverend Sullivan hears the MUSIC and LAUGHTER.   He
frowns, afraid for Jamie's health.


INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM

Jamie grips Landon's arms, seems to slip, suddenly too
exhausted to carry her weight. Landon picks her up,
gently carries her back to bed. Settles her in.

                           LANDON
          How you doing?

                          JAMIE
                   (murmurs)
          Tired.

each other. Landon reaches for her hand. When he looks
at her face again, she's asleep.


EXT. LANDON'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - ANOTHER DAY

Landon's sitting on his childhood tree swing, twisting

Landon freezes, not sure what to expect.


EXT. PICKUP

The truck makes a circle around Landon, then stops. The
MUSIC QUIETS. Eric and Clay jump down. A long tense
moment, then:

                           ERIC
             Hey.

                           LANDON
             Hey.

Without a word, Clay walks to the Yugo, lifts the heaviest
telescope part, and carries it to the bed of the pickup.
Eric follows suit.


EXT. PARSONAGE - BACK YARD - LATER

Landon studies the pieces of the smaller telescope and how
they fit together. They are like a map for how to build
the bigger one.


EXT. PARSONAGE DRIVEWAY - NEXT DAY

concrete form-tube from his car. Carries it around the
house toward the back yard.

lights above the humble VINYARD household. A black FORD
BRONCO rests in the driveway.

EXT. WET STREET - A GRAY TRANS AM

TUPAC'S rapping builds. The window-tinted drive-by
slowly heads down the residential street, cruises past
the Bronco in the driveway, and slows to a stop. The
music stops and TWO BLACK MEN spring from the car.

They move with purpose. The larger figure, crowbar in
hand, moves to the truck. The GUN wielding passenger
hurries to the front door and stands guard. Inside the
car, another man methodically waits.

INT. BEDROOM - DANNY VINYARD'S EYES

A poster of Lee Ving of FEAR onstage, taped to the wall.
Pre-Calculus and Biology books on the floor. Cassettes

Derek, Danny, Seth, Cammeron, Curtis and Stacey stand
outside the Bronco. The doors are all open and the

sweaty, tattooed body. Danny watches the tats disappear,
and it's almost like his brother is normal. A name tag

That is true. Your father is right.
Science can teach us more about
what's out there -
    (With a hand to her
     heart:)
- but not what is in here. Art,
music, literature - they all spring
from our faith.

                Some eat meat, some eat vegetable.
                I do not expect us all to agree
                about everything. But I would much
                rather have you believe in
                something I don't agree with than
                to accept everything blindly. And
                that begins with thinking
                rationally. Do you understand?

     Pi nods.

                          FATHER (CONT'D)
                Good.

     Pause.

                I would like to be baptized.

     Is Fromm saying he's in? Is Keitel's death a
     condition? Hard to say and meant to be. Before
     Stauffenberg can inquire, Fromm slams the door shut
     and returns to the madness inside the Berghof.

     Stauffenberg puts on his eyepatch before removing his

     stares at him from his gloved hand. A conscience.

                    hire music.  There's nothing but
                    chin-wag.  The cold dreary custard

     Before he can give Cukor their names Princess Margaret's
     polite smile bursts open in a joyful display of teeth.

      and dance.

      James sings PLEASE! at a much faster pace than at King. Aunt
      Honey and her girls bump and grind to the music.

      James walks off stage and just outside Big Bills. A bath
      towel is put over James' back and head to absorb his sweat.

      right at us. He begins to smile.

      He then looks over to Bobby and nods.   The band resumes
      Please, Please, Please.

      Suddenly James throws the towel off of himself and runs to
      the stage. The cape act is born.

          I mean is, it's so far ahead of
          it's time that they ain't got a
          name for it yet. Take another
          record, any record from your stack
          at home. I don't care if it's from
          Motown or Stax or whatever...and
          put it on your box. None of them
          are gonna sound like mine. Not
          even my own old records. Just like
          the title says, it's a "new bag".

          The groove is solid. Bam Bap. It
          don't move. It's like a heartbeat.
          It's inside you, driving
          everything. Hard. Flat. A groove.

      INT. PRIVATE AIRPORT TERMINAL. LATER THAT DAY. JAMES

      James is giving a press conference to a group of journalists.

                    INTERVIEWER
          Welcome to Reno, Mr. Brown. What
          exactly do you call your style of
          music?

                    JAMES BROWN
          I call it James Brown music. What
          I mean is, it's so far ahead of
          it's time that they ain't got a
          name for it yet. Take another
          record, any record from your stack
          at home. I don't care if it's from
          Motown or Stax or whatever...and
          put it on your box. None of them
          are gonna sound like mine. Not
          even my own old records. Just like
          the title says, it's a "new bag".
          See the funk is in the bass. The
          bass never changes. It's a groove,
          lady. Soon as you hear that
          groove, I know I got you.

                    INTERVIEWER
          And what exactly is the groove?

                    JAMES BROWN
          The groove is something you feel.
          The groove is solid. Bam Bap. It
          don't move. It's like a heartbeat.

          I just did.
              (Then)
          See Miss. See there's some things,
          they're just too big to fit in a
          magazine. But we all feel it. Even
          little Teddy here know it when he
          feel it.

James groans "Um booga chooca. Um". Teddy is lit up;
thrilled. He sings.

       Bass clipped, drum-like, the off rhythm of Jimmy's guitar
       bringing the whole room together.

    An ornate door; ancient, with strange, beautiful dark symbols
    carved into the old wood, like something out of a castle in
    Prague. The doors open and we see a large chapel. And within
    the large dark interior, lit by great long candles, the
    Brotherhood have gathered. They all stare at the camera,
    which we reveal is Silus' POV.

    We see SILUS. Unchanged, still the perfect creature he has
    always been. But for now the suit has gone and instead he
    stands draped in fine ropes, robes that carry his life on
    them; achievements, his rank, which is now high.

    In the distance, at an alter, stands AUGUSTUS. He is also in
    his gowns. A gong sounds and the Brothers, in unison with the
    music, begin to chant; it is eerie, it sounds like Tibetan
    monks.

                         If you'll just stay in your seats a 
                         few moments and fill out these cards 
                         for us...

               ON AISLES

               Matt and others handing out cards with pencils attached... 
               Folks filling them out. As an ADOLESCENT MALE fills it out; 
               PREVIEW CARD FILLS THE SCREEN as we view LIVE ACTION THROUGH 
               IT.

               INT. THEATER MANAGER'S OFFICE

               An office meant for two, containing twenty counters. The 
               counting is done with erasers rifling stacks, creating a 
               sound, a MUSICAL RHYTHM, as the GROUP CAPTAIN calls out with 
               gospel cadence.

                                     GROUP CAPTAIN
                         Who has young males? Young women? 
                         Older males?... Older males?...

               Matt, his tally finished, squats on the floor, waiting. The 
               Group Captain approaches.

                                     GROUP CAPTAIN
                         Older males... older males?

               Matt looks blank.

                                     GROUP CAPTAIN
                              (again)
                         Older males... over 25?

               Matt now realizes that it is his category and hands over the 
               older male cards and exits.

               INT. THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT

               Burke, prowling the lobby as audience stragglers leave and 
               Studio Execs and Popcorn Development Staff wait. He looks 
               off to see Matt and Nan chatting in another part of the lobby.

                         Don't stare at me.

                                     MATT
                         Sorry.

                                     JEANNIE
                         I want to put on my yellow dress 
                         now.

                                     MATT
                         It's underneath the plane. We can't 
                         get it.

               And just that quick, Jeannie screams.

                                     JEANNIE
                         I want to put on my dress. I want to 
                         put on my dress.

               Other passengers turn around. This is pretty raw stuff we're 
               into. Temper in all its wildness, MUSIC UNDER... electric 
               guitar beginning to match the energy and naked emotion of 
               the child.

                                     MATT
                         There's no way we can get the dress--
                         it's impossible.

               Jeannie's feet start kicking in front of her--the person in 
               that seat turning sharply around.

                                     MATT
                         Don't kick the seat!

                                     JEANNIE
                         I want the yellow dress.
                              (a shriek)
                         Give me a compromise.

               She is crying now.

                                     MATT
                         As soon as we land. That's the 
                         compromise.

                         compromise.

               MORE MUSIC

               Without warning, Jeannie slaps herself in the face. All five 
               people in the row ahead turn and say in unison:

                                     WOMEN IN ROW
                         Don't hit her.

                         God, I didn't hit her--she hit her.

               ANGLE ON LIGHTS

               As everyone starts pushing the cabin attendant call button. 
               These dings magnify until they're part of the music--as it 
               drives and drives... Matt takes Jeannie's hand and tries to 
               restrain her.

                                     JEANNIE
                         Noooooo. Let go of me. Noooo. The 
                         yellow dress... let go... let go.

               She breaks away from him. He moves after her.

               CAMERA MOVING

               At breakneck speed, Jeannie dashes through the plane with 
               her father in pursuit... flashes of disapproving faces. The 
               seat belt sign goes on. A FLIGHT ATTENDANT blocks his path.

                                     FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                         You'll have to sit down.

               Jeannie takes advantage of Matt's being stopped and moves 
               into the toilet, locking the door behind her.

                                     MATT
                              (yelling)

                         We'll be having some turbulence for 
                         the next twenty minutes or so. Will 
                         the cabin attendants please take 
                         their seats?

                         Sir.

                              (simply and utterly)
                         I have no idea what to do.

               A sudden bump and Matt falls. He yells to the locked door.

                                     MATT
                         Jeannie, you okay?

                         Go back to your seat. I'll get her.

               As Matt makes his way back, the Flight Attendant uses a hidden 
               latch to open the door. Music building--then calming, the 
               worst is over. Matt makes his way back to his seat, shell-
               shocked. The Attendant leans over him.

                                     FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                         She wants to be alone. So we're 
                         upgrading her.

               He just nods.

               FULL SHOT

               Down the aisle--Jeannie lets an Attendant lead her as she 
               peers back at her dad.

               EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Matt carrying the sleeping child like a sack over his 
               shoulder, also managing to hold onto all her luggage.

               INT. MATT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               He has propped her on the sofa, a cotton nightgown out. He 
               is unbuttoning her dress. She opens her eyes, the window's 
               protective bars PLACING A SHADOW ACROSS HER FACE. She attempts 
               to cover her fear.

                         one do you want?

               She surveys her pitiful choice; then points to the sleeping 
               bag.

                                     JEANNIE
                         That.

               She gets into it. He zips her up--then she says something 
               remarkably unexpected.

                                     JEANNIE
                         Hug.

               Amazed, Matt hugs her. A half-beat, then:

                                     JEANNIE
                              (sharply)
                         Let go.

               He does--then stands and looks down at her. She looks back, 
               mocking his stare with one of her own.

               INT. BATHROOM - DAY

               Nan uncertainly enters this decidedly masculine bathroom. 
               She is wearing an evening gown. The sun streams through the 
               lush foliage outside a wall-sized window. MUSIC as she opens 
               her purse and removes a pillbox; at one point lightly singing 
               a snatch of lyric concerning the conflicts of being a single 
               woman and a single mother--this while totally focused on the 
               pills.

               INSERT - PILL BOX

               A major movie shot of this compartmentalized box. Each 
               burrowed nest clearly labeled for the pill it contains: 
               VITAMIN B, VITAMIN A, OSCILLOCOCCINUM, PROZAC, CALCIUM, TEST 
               DRUG, ASPIRIN, XANAX, ETC.

               ON NAN

               MUSIC CONTINUES. She dials a phone number while arching her 
               neck and swallowing one pill after another with little swigs 
               of water. This process continuing, even as she speaks into 
               the phone.

               INT. MATT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               As they enter and Matt pushes her into the other room and 
               closes the door, placing her in there alone.

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Jeannie, behind the double glass-paneled doors of the bedroom.

               HER POV

               Matt, upset in a way he has never imagined, as he pops a 
               beer--puts on some headphones for calming music and begins 
               to read a book on child behavior modification.

               ON JEANNIE

               Feeling the restrictions of her punishment, pacing and now 
               she begins to wail "THIS LONELY LIFE". Few adult women have 
               sung with such appropriate passion out of need and loss, 
               aloneness and confusion. The song finishes. Jeannie sits 
               huddled.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

               This rooftop serves as an outdoor commissary for Popcorn 
               Pictures. There are a few tables, snack machines and 
               umbrellas. The whole "D" staff is there, including Cathy, 
               having lunch, along with Claire, the casting assistant. In 
               the b.g., we see Matt, huddled, sitting on the roof's awful 
               green outdoor carpeting, feeling much the same as Jeannie in 
               the previous scene.

               ON MATT

               Off in the distance, the Popcorn execs contentedly ply their 
               trade. As he overhears their conversation and the words begin 
               to register in all their horror.

               Jeannie doesn't know quite how to take the name calling. 
               MUSIC IN... we're heading for a rendezvous with a dance as 
               it CONTINUES ACROSS THE CUT TO:

               EXT. TV STAGE - EARLY MORNING

               Matt and Jeannie walking from the catering truck. They are

               We see Jeannie's face in the mirror, but it is seen through 
               something resembling fleece, which we now recognize as the 
               strands of Jeannie's hair being combed out to the side by an 
               expert hair-dresser. Jeannie is shifting nervously in the 
               large room where each chair is filled with a child of a 
               different age and color. In the b.g., we can HEAR the voice 
               of the WARM-UP MAN.

               Dear White People, apparently

Kurt turns his heat towards Lionel - has a bone to pick.

     Lionel walks through the empty office - slows down as he over
     hears...

                         GEORGE (O.S.)
               Lionel's story on the would-be
               protest outside of Gillespie is
               running tomorrow and I'm also
               having Lionel work on a profile
               piece of Armstrong/Parker like you
               suggested. Really break down what's
               going on.

     Lionel gingerly approaches the door to see George finish up a
     phone call.

                         GEORGE (CONT'D)
               Right. It's almost like they
               recycle so much from their past -
               Music, food, fashion, and now
               turbulence.

     This leaves a bitter taste in Lionel's mouth.

               Thank you so much. Okay, take care.

               Well?

                         GEORGE
               That was our Times advisor. He said
               it's stories like these that get
               editors recommendation letters.

     Lionel knocks on the door. Annie and George are startled but
     reassured when they see who it is.

Hana sits reading from the Herodotus.  She shows the Patient the page 
where a CHRISTMAS CRACKER WRAPPER covered in handwriting has been glued 
in.

			HANA
		Tell me about this, this is in your

A CHRISTMAS PARTY FOR THE TROOPS.  The incongruous attempts to create a 
traditional Christmas in the dusty heat of Cairo.  

The Party is in the courtyard of the Moorish Palace which serves as the 
private residence of the British Ambassador, SIR RONNIE HAMPTON.  Lots 
of Wives, including LADY HAMPTON and Katharine help serve tea and cake 
to the SOLDIERS who sit at rudimentary tables with paper plates and 
paper hats.  A man dressed as SANTA CLAUS is giving out presents - 
PENGUIN PAPERBACKS, CHOCOLATE.  Music blares out from a loudspeaker.  
Officers and Civilians walk the parameter.  One of these, arriving, is 
Almasy.  He sits in the shade, catches Katharine's attention.  
Katharine brings him over a cup of tea and a plate with Christmas cake 
on it.

Hana stands at the PIANO.  It's still lop-sided, propped against the 
wall.  She tries but can't move it.  So she pulls off the dust-sheet 
and, with the instrument still on a tilt, begins to play the Aria from 
Bach's Goldberg Variations.


109	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.

HANA'S PIANO CONTINUES.  Upstairs, Caravaggio chats with the Patient 
while working his arms to RAISE A VEIN, a boot-lace tied around it, 
preparing an injection for himself, tapping the syringe.  During this:

			THE PATIENT
		I have come to love that little tap of

110*.	INT.    MONASTERY LIBRARY.    DAY.

Hana plays.  GUN SHOTS punctuates the music.  She's totally engrossed 
and only hears the second or third shot.  Her hands falter, she looks 
up to see A SIKH SOLDIER RUNNING ACROSS THE FIELD WAVING HIS ARMS, his 
REVOLVER held aloft.  He approaches the door, his face creased with 
anxiety, and raps on the shattered frame.  It's KIP.

She gets up and walks past Kip standing at the door, and continues the 
seven or eight feet to the right and out into the garden VIA THE HOLE 
RIPPED OUT OF THE WALL.

			HANA
		Excuse me.  Yes?
				(of the doors)
		I don't have the key to that door.

			KIP
		The Germans were here.  The Germans 
		were all over this area.  They left mines

		hiding places.

		Then may be you're safe as long as

		Congratulations.  

And now they're all shaking hands, and slapping backs and the SOLDIERS 
FROM THE TANKS are there and the victory  celebrations begin.  Kip's 
blank, drained, not taking anything in, as Dade wraps a blanket around 
his shoulders.

HANA'S ON TOP OF THE VIADUCT, watching as Kip is wrapped in his 
blanket, the men celebrating.  She shouts with relief from the top of 
the bridge.

	A VICTORY CELEBRATION PARTY.

The gramophone plays Frank Sinatra.  Kip sits in the window, the 
shutters open, the village lit up behind his head, nodding to the 
music, sucking out of his condensed milk.  Elsewhere there is an open 
bottle of cognac, some wine.  The Patient has a beaker of wine.  
Caravaggio is dancing with Hana.

			HANA
		Kip - come and dance with me

165	EXT.    VILLAGE SQUARE.    NIGHT.

A tiny PIAZZA where the Sappers and the Villagers are having their own, 
more raucous, Victory Feste.  There are accordions, there's dancing, 
and there's HARDY, stripped to some exotic underpants, a large tattoo: 
DORIS inside a heart, clambering up the EQUESTRIAN STATUE IN THE MIDDLE 
OF THE FOUNTAIN.  He's astride the horse and now straining to get up to 
the tip of the outstretched sword, so that he can hang the UNION JACK 
FLAG he has in his mouth.

BLACKLER, one of the Sappers, is Hardy's assistant.  He's drunk and 
slips from his ladder, falling flat on his back into the fountain with 
a great splash, to much hilarity.  


166	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.

Hana and Caravaggio are still dancing.  The music has stopped.  
Caravaggio changes the record.  Hana goes to Kip for a second, beaming, 
before Caravaggio has snatched her away again.  The Patient taps along 
to the music.

19    EXT. HILL / LOS ANGELES STREETS - NIGHT

      Mia trudges down the steep hill in her unwieldy heels. She's an
      hour-and-a-half walk from her place. She crosses roads and lots,
      navigates stretches where the sidewalk stops and gives way to
      shrubbery.

A19   And then -- she hears something... Music. A piano, in the
      distance. And a MELODY -- one we will come to know very well...

      Without being sure why, she FOLLOWS THE SOUND. Passes several
      doors. Then stops. Has found where it's coming from...

      She reaches out -- and slowly opens a door...

          That's why you need to be in the space

          but when I have my own place -- my club --
          they'll play whatever they want.

see something in him now -- the same passion he's speaking of...

     Mia and Sebastian exit. Wave "good-bye". We FOLLOW Sebastian.
     He rounds the corner, nears the Hermosa Beach pier...

     ...and begins to SING. [CITY OF STARS] Lifted by a strange
     new feeling -- a feeling he wasn't expecting. The feeling
     that perhaps -- just perhaps -- he's falling in love...

     He gazes out at the sea, the purple sky. Dances with an OLD
     COUPLE, then continues on his way, as though caught in a
     dream. There's an uncertainty in his singing -- he's not sure
     if this dream will sustain. But for now, it's a beautiful
     feeling...

     The MUSIC simmers down -- and WE FADE OUT.

45   EXT. AUDITION BUILDING - DAY

      Mia dashes out -- and LEAPS into Sebastian's car and into his
      arms. They KISS -- giddy, emotional, as though they'd been
      separated for years. Sebastian drives off -- when --

      The car SCREECHES to a stop in front of a TRUCK going the
      opposite direction. Sebastian goes into REVERSE as Mia cracks
      up laughing. A BURST OF MUSIC as a title card pops on:

      The MUSIC carries us through the following series of GLIMPSES:

      BUNKER HILL...

63    -- Mia guiding Sebastian down a street peppered with SILENT-
      ERA HOMES, past old gas-lamps and palms...

65    -- VAN BEEK. Sebastian gestures to the "TAPAS &amp; TUNES" sign.
      Excitedly tries to deface it. Mia, aghast, pulls him back...

66    -- The HUNTINGTON GARDENS, where Mia and Sebastian gaze at
      the tiny forest...

A66   -- WATTS TOWERS, where the two lovers stroll and kiss...

      1940's high-rises, green movie-movie lettering, ochre walls
      shaded by palm fronds, red flowers and Spanish missions, old
      lamps and Art Deco hotels. It's a gorgeous city, and the music

106.   INT. SAYER'S CAR - MOVING - DAY                            106
Leonard turns the radio dial from the classical station to
another playing a very different kind of music, and listens to
it bemused but intrigued. It's John Lennon singing "A DAY IN
THE LIFE"
and it CONTINUES OVER:

107.   EXT. PARK - THE BRONX - LATER - DAY                        107
Children playing flag-football on an expanse of grass. Dogs
running around, nannies with prams, lovers.
A disk, a frisbee, falls at Leonard's feet. He retrieves it
but has no idea what it is or what to do with it. Sayer
demonstrates the wrist action with an invisible one. Leonard
doesn't get it. Sayer takes it from him and flings it
pathetically not halfway back to its owners.
The music CONTINUES OVER:

108.   EXT. STREET CORNER JOINT - THE BRONX - LATER - DAY        108.
Leonard watches with interest a Carvel ice cream machine. He
and Sayer are handed cones and Leonard's attention moves to a
girl wearing an unbelievably short skirt.
Her boyfriend stares at Leonard. Sayer tries to pull his
charge's attention elsewhere. Leonard, finally, glances away,
up, to a sound overhead.
The music CONTINUES OVER:

                                                                  109
109.   EXT. KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY
A 747 roaring down a runway. At the edge of it, it lifts off
and thunders over Sayer and Leonard and the parked Toyota.
Exhilerated, Leonard waves.
The music CONTINUES OVER:
110.   OMITTED                                                    110

An expressway. The Toyota traveling at "astounding" speed,
passing a sign that reads CITY ISLAND.

			You're in music, I guess, aren't

	KENNY starts to answer.

			I didn't think it would. She's

			Guess if you have to change your

					KENNY
			She sure sings nice.

					GREEN
			My wife and I think so, but we're

			or bad depending on how you look at

			sing?

					KENNY
			Oh... a little of both. Just

	SODA SHOP.

	The place has "morphed" even more. If it was a teenage
	hangout before, it has become almost a Bohemian coffee house

	several patrons talk "intensely" in their booths.

	It looks like a scene from the French Revolution. Ten to

something, and so do we.  Soft and faraway, it's a PIANO. 
The melody is soft, lilting -- almost a lullaby.

Gilbert, as he marches off to fight the Great War.

Luke stares at the screen.  The look on his face is one of
bewilderment -- and awe.

ANGLE - THE PIANO

The rickety old upright is tinny-sounding and slightly out-
of-tune.  But it really doesn't matter.

CLOSER

Mrs. Terwilliger is playing passionately.  She never takes
her eyes -- which are full of tears -- off the tattered
screen, except to close them when she is overcome with
emotion.  Even so, she never misses a beat.

INT.  ORCHESTRA PIT - DAY

As work progresses all around her, Mrs. Terwilliger has just
finished dusting off the piano.  She opens the keyboard cover
and trails her hand delicately over the keys.  She sits,
closes her eyes, and begins to play -- Chopin's Op. 10 Etude
No. 3 -- delicate, flowing music.  Even though the piano is a
bit out of tune, it's still beautiful.

As she plays, all the work slowly comes to a halt.  Before
long, all eyes are on her.  Everyone's listening. 
Transported.

After a moment, she stops.  Overcome.  Everyone applauds. 
Surprised, Mrs. Terwilliger stands, and, blushing, bows.

                    LUKE
          That was beautiful.

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
          I taught you that.

                    LUKE
          I can play the piano?

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
              (all fluttery)
          Oh dear, yes.  You were an
          excellent student, before all that
          clarinet nonsense.  You loved
          Chopin.  You used to call it
          "heaven music."  "Teach me some
          heaven music," you used to say.

She sits at the piano.

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
          Sit.  Play with me.

                    LUKE
          No, I...

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
          Some of it might come back to you.

Reluctantly, Luke sits down to her left.  As she begins to
play a Chopin waltz, she encourages him to keep the 3/4 time.

                    MRS. TERWILLIGER
          That's good... that's good...

But it's clear Luke has no idea what he's doing.  He's just
plunking bass notes.  But after a moment, the bass figures
he's improvising start to change -- and before long, it's
transformed into the eight-to-the-bar figure of a boogie
woogie beat.  Mrs. Terwilliger stops playing, annoyed.

     As he peeks up from the backseat looking forward through

     leading edge of a flash flood. A four-foot high wall of

     water has taken over the desert with a flash flood.

     However, there's no panic in Chris' face as we observe

     while violent seems to have topped off just above the
     wheels. Chris gets a slight smile on his face, as the
     car settles into its new position below the cliff. He
     returns to sleep.

     What remains of Chris' travelling money burns in a pile
     beside the Datsun on the sun-lit but muddy desert floor.

     We follow a very long set of footprints (CAMERA
     TRACKING/TRUE VERTICAL) away from the burning cash
     through the mud, finally tilting up to the footprint
     maker, Chris. Slogging toward high ground.

     WIDE-SHOT: We see the abandoned Datsun nearly a mile
     behind Chris as he walks toward us wearing his backpack.
     He comes very close to camera (only a day or two's
     stubble on his face) and as we PAN him 180, we see as
     much wilderness before us as we did behind.

     Hibachi. Chris averts his eyes when Sonja rises from the
     water, topless.

      In the trees beside the river, we find Chris. The river
      is not yet in sight but Chris starts to HEAR it: A
      building rumble.

      As Chris exits the treeline, there she is: The Teklanika
      at full flood. Seventy-five foot wide banks, replacing
      the narrow ice canal of four months earlier. Snowmelt
      from glaciers high in the Alaska range, its opaque
      glacial sediment the color of wet concrete. And what had
      been a distant rumble in the woods, now had the volume
      and power of a freight train, a seventy-five foot wide
      one.

      Chris grabs a hold of a riverside branch and takes one
      slow, careful step into the river. Without mercy, WHAM!
      the river kicks his feet out from under him! The branch
      he holds SNAPS! By some miracle, his hands move like
      lightening and he grabs a lower, sturdier branch below,
      saving himself from a certain death.

                         that was a bad thing, not, like, a 
                         business strategy.

               Rob looks over Barry at Marie.  She catches his eye as she 
               looks over the room.  His eyes shoot to the floor.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. RECORD STORE - STOCK ROOM - LATER

               Rob is going through a huge stack of used CD's, sorting them 
               off into different bins, bouncing his head absently to the 
               music -- the same song of Marie's that Rob had on when Laura 
               called last night.

                                     BARRY (O.S.)
                         ROB!  PHONE!

               Rob reaches over and hits the SPEAKER button on the phone, 
               still in the groove of sorting.

                                     ROB
                         Rob here.

                                     LIZ (O.S.)
                         Hey.  It's Liz.

                         Liz, can you hold for a second?

               He hits hold.

                                     ROB
                              (to Dick)
                         I'll be out there!  Go!
                              (picks up the phone)
                         Hey, Liz, I gotta go... Tomorrow 
                         night?  Great.  Green Mill.  Fine.  
                         Seven?  Done.  Thanks.  Right.  Bye.

               He hangs up fast, spins around to look in a cracked one-foot-
               square cracked mirror bearing the logo of Aerosmith that is 
               mounted on the wall, and moves out into the

               FRONT ROOM

               and up the aisle fast toward the stereo where he turns Marie's 
               music off.  He takes a deep breath and looks up, meeting her 
               eyes.

                                     ROB
                         Oh.  Hi.

               Marie smiles.

                                     MARIE
                              (re: music)
                         Don't you like that?

                                     ROB
                         No, no, I love, it's just, thinking 
                         you're, you must be so sick of it...  
                         Well.

               He reaches back and puts it back on.  He cracks his face 
               into a smile, then walks fast back to the stock room door.  
               Marie watches him go.

               STOCK ROOM

               where as soon as he crosses the threshold his fist clench 
               and he grimaces:

                                     ROB
                         WHAT FUCKING IAN GUY?!!

               Dick comes in --

               DICK

               is listening to a female customer, but he doesn't hear her 
               voice.

               CUSTOMER - DICK'S POV

               The army bag with a red cross on it.  The ring-of-ivy tattoo 
               around the wrist.  The monkey boots.  The eye shadow.

               DICK

               thinking, calculating...

                                     DICK
                         The interesting thing about Green 
                         Day is that so much of their music 
                         is in truth directly influenced by, 
                         in my opinion, two bands.

                                     FEMALE CUSTOMER
                         The Clash.

                                     DICK
                         Correct.  The Clash.  But also the 
                         Stranglers.

                                     FEMALE CUSTOMER

                         I think you would love the 
                         Stranglers...

               Dick pulls a Stranglers record and puts it on the stereo.  
               Her brow furrows, and then she smiles.

               Barry adds more records to the Customer's stack.

               A FEW MINUTES LATER - ROB AND DICK

               stand behind the counter.  Rob holds a CD in his hand, and 
               surveys the roaming customers with a semi-serious air of 
               authority.

                                     ROB
                         I will now sell four copies of Cats 
                         and Dogs by the Royal Trux.

                                     DICK
                         Do it.  Do it.

               Rob pops the CD in and it begins to play... He stands there 
               with his arms folded, waiting.  After a moment, a Customer 
               approaches.

                                     CUSTOMER
                              (re: music)
                         What is this?

                         It's the Royal Trux.

                                     CUSTOMER
                         It's great.

                                     ROB
                         I know.

               ROB'S POV

               of the room.  Something has caught his eye: a cropped head 
               with a leopard skin pattern surfaces and disappears, like 
               Nessie.

               Rob's face gets hot and mad.  He jumps out from behind the 
               counter.

                         You are not in a band, Barry.  You 
                         are not a musician.  And no posters.

                                     BARRY
                         Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really 
                         appreciate it.

                         Steely Dan song.  And it was in The

                         You can't be called Barry and sing 
                         in a group called Barrytown.

                         Just that Rob seems to think it would 
                         be wiser to start a record label by 
                         putting out a record with business-
                         crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters 
                         than with someone he knows in his

               Laura puts it together, and smiles.  She goes to the back 
               and crack the door, finding Rob sitting on a box, thinking.

                         your nights, and I saw you're doing 
                         it again and that your putting out a 
                         record, and it's sort of a then-and-
                         now story against the backdrop of 
                         the Chicago music scene with the

                         I shouldn't have let you in.  You

                         What I mean is, I didn't mean you 
                         look young.  You don't.  You don't 
                         look old either.  You look just as

                         but not a lot.  Not much.  Just right.

		I can't believe this is a coincidence,

		Yes, I remember.

		It's an advertisement, Mr. Cole.  You

		Why are we doing this?

		So we can stick our heads out the

	There are tears in her eyes.  They discomfit COLE.

		But maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe you're

                   Yes, there is. Something is
                   happening here. You have to

                   of the museum benefit this year.
                   I cannot be upset now. We can

      The last scene of Don Giovanni is being played out.       The
      Commandatori has the Don in his grip, urging him to
      "repent." The Don refuses. The MUSIC THUNDERS
      threateningly.

          Well, they were still mad at you for

                    CAROLYN
          Their sycamore? C'mon! A substantial
          portion of the root structure was on our
          property. You know that. How can you call
          it their sycamore? I wouldn't have the

          wasn't partially mine, which of course it
          was.

Carolyn, carrying a basket of fresh cut ROSES, passes by the
GARAGE WINDOW. From inside the garage, we HEAR ROCK MUSIC.

Carolyn stops and SNIFFS the air, frowning. She peers through
the window.

Her POV: Lester, in a T-shirt and gym shorts, lies on a new
WEIGHT BENCH, doing bench presses with shiny new BARBELLS.

INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

ROCK MUSIC blasts from a new BOOMBOX on the floor.

The garage is in the process of becoming Lester's sanctuary.
An ugly but comfortable 70's BOWL CHAIR has been pulled out
and cleaned off, his old hot rod magazines strewn across it,
and the remote-controlled MODEL JEEP KIT is spread across a
card table. The SHELVES that Lester tore through earlier have
been dismantled, leaving a blank wall on which now hangs a
DART BOARD.

Lester finishes his last rep, straining, then puts the
weights in their rack and sits up. As he takes a drag off a
joint, the GARAGE DOOR suddenly starts to open. Lester looks
up, squinting at:

His POV: The door raises to reveal Carolyn, silhouetted
against the bright sunlight outside, pointing a REMOTE at us.

                    LESTER
          Uh-oh, mom's mad.

          minute away from snowing. And there's
          this electricity in the air, you can
          almost hear it, right? And this bag was
          just... dancing with me. Like a little

          fifteen minutes. That's the day I
          realized that there was this entire life
          behind things, and this incredibly
          benevolent force that wanted me to know
          there was no reason to be afraid. Ever.

see how she reacts to this...

He goes back to eating his meal, as if nothing unusual has
happened. Carolyn sits in her chair, shivering with rage.
Jane just stares at the plate in front of her.

          Oh, and another thing. From now on, we're

We're FLYING above Robin Hood Trail. We see the BURNHAM'S
HOUSE below us as we APPROACH it steadily.

                    LESTER
          Remember those posters that said, "Today
          is the first day of the rest of your
          life?" Well, that's true of every day
          except one.

We're almost on top of the Burnham house now, as Lester,
wearing sweatpants and running shoes, bursts out of the front
door and dashes up the driveway.

EXT. ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - A SHORT TIME LATER

We're now at street level, as Lester runs toward us. He
carries a WALKMAN and wears EARPHONES, and we HEAR ROCK MUSIC
as he runs. The endorphins have kicked in, and Lester grins,
reveling in the sheer physical pleasure of his body.

                                                            74.



INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - A SHORT TIME LATER

The blender GRINDS as Lester, still in his sweatpants, makes
himself a high-protein shake. He's in excellent shape; even
his posture has changed, and he moves with the confident,
easy swagger of an athlete. Jane watches him blankly from the
kitchen table.

Carolyn enters. Lester leans against the counter, drinking
his shake directly from the blender pitcher, eyeing her. He's
got a newfound sexual energy that makes her uncomfortable,
and he knows it. Carolyn quickly rinses off her coffee cup,
avoiding his eyes, and starts out.

                    CAROLYN
          Jane, hurry up. I've got a very important
          appointment--

          expensive divorce.

          In order to be successful, one must
          project an image of success. At all
          times.

She regrets it the second it's out of her mouth, and turns to
him. He just looks at her sadly, then gets out of the car and
shuts the door. She starts to CRY. As before, she SLAPS
herself, hard.

                    CAROLYN (CONT'D)
          Stop it. Stop it!

She closes her eyes tight, trying to stop the tears, then
suddenly SCREAMS as loud as she can.

Buddy's Jaguar speeds off, leaving the Mercedes alone in the
parking lot. We can still HEAR Carolyn's muffled SCREAMING.
There is a sound of distant THUNDER.

It's RAINING outside. We HEAR ROCK MUSIC as Lester pumps
iron. He puts the weights down and looks at his REFLECTION in
the window:

          TJ stands for a beat and watches them. This is strange.

                          HESHER
           What's the problem? That's the guy who
           put you in the toilet.

           Yeah, but -

          TJ looks around everywhere. What's coming?
                         
          Then Hesher lets out a FART. He laughs. He puts the van in gear
          and drives. He cranks up the music.
                         
          TJ stares at Hesher for a moment, then looks straight ahead

          As TJ nears the front door, Hesher turns and moves away to
          reveal Grandma talking to two uniformed police officers.

          phone and paging through a teen magazine all at the same
          time, multi-tasking.
          
          She doesn't hear the door bell RING the first time. Or the

young; she has thick, wavy brown hair.  He is one of those typical seducers 
from the provinces, with black hair. There is a tiny radio between them. 
Sandro also takes a peek into the compartment. Then they withdraw as the two

It is evening. Sandro's car is pulling into the town of Taormina on its way 
to the San Domenico. It comes to a small square and passes by a group of men 
and women seated on the steps of an ancient ruin. They are dressed in evening 
clothes and are laughing and giggling. The car turns into the street of the  
San Domenico and stops in front of the hotel. A porter immediately comes out 
and opens the door. Claudia and Sandro get out and head towards the small 
courtyard that leads into the foyer.

The lobby is full of activity and alive with people dressed in formal attire. 
Claudia is clearly intrigued by everything she sees: the surroundings, the 
people, etc. Sandro approaches the reception desk as Claudia walks slightly 
ahead, anxious to see what is going on. The sound of music is heard coming 
from one of the halls at the other end of the lobby. There is obviously a 
party underway: further on, through a glass partition, couples are seen 
dancing. Suddenly, Claudia stops. Directly up ahead, she notices Patrizia. As 
soon as she see Claudia, Patrizia comes to greet her, smiling.
 
				PATRIZIA 
		Well, I'm looking for somebody else and who do

Claudia smiles and they both kiss each other on the cheek.

119   EXT. CLEARING - DAY                                           119
      The natives have gathered nearby. They have been moved,              *
      perhaps by the music, or perhaps by the simple, universal            *
      posture of worship itself. They begin to sing, a low,
      rhythmic, compelling chant. It mingles with the distant
      voice of Father Diogo, and then with the chanting voices
      of all the Europeans, until it seems that the whole
      world is praying.


120   EXT. CAMP - MORNING                                           120
      Next morning the camp on the beach     is being broken up.
      The place is like a junkyard. The      amount of damage that
      a hundred and fifty people can do     to a beach in two days
      is impressive. Dom Paulo and the      officers watch the work.
      With them are some messengers from     the king, and the
      Slave translator.
      One of the messengers is talking.     When he finishes, the
      Slave translates.
                                 SLAVE
                   Yes... they will look after the
                   sick... but the King would like
                   one thing... the machine that

          Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig...and the great
          Shoeless Joe Jackson. Dad was a Yankees
          fan then, so of course I rooted for
          Brooklyn. But in '58 the Dodgers moved
          away, so we had to find other things to
          fight about. We did. And when it came
          time to go to college, I picked the
          farthest one from home I could find.
          Berkeley in the 1960s: hippies, protesters, etc.

          RAY (V.0.)
          This, of course, drove him right up the

          Officially my major was English, but
          really it was the Sixties.

          RAY (V.O.)
          I marched, I smoked some grass, I tried
          to like sitar music... and I met Annie.
          Annie: blue jeans, T-shirt, freckles. Their courtship.

          RAY (V.0.)
          The only thing we had in common was that
          she came from Iowa and I had once heard
          of Iowa. We moved in together. After
          graduation, we moved to the Midwest, and
          stayed with her family as long as we
          could.
          Unsmiling American Gothic types.

          The apartment, Ray at different jobs, the wedding.

          RAY (V.0.)
          We rented an apartment and I took a job
          selling insurance. I also drove a cab
          and worked in a pizza parlor. Dad died
          in June of 1 74. Annie and I got married
          that fail.

          A few years later Karin was born. She
          smelled weird, but we loved her anyway.
          Then Annie got the crazy idea that she
          could talk me into buying a farm.

          front row.   He ignores Geoffrey.
          Gertrude sits nearby, next to Gilbertson.
          From the gazebo, Richard nods at a GROUP OF CELLO PLAYERS, who
          begin playing from downloaded sheet music that reads "Kool and
          the Gang, Cherish".   Heads turn with the start of the music, to
          see Annie walk Margaret down the aisle.
          When Margaret recognizes the song, she smiles.

          Nice song.
          Richard shrugs his shoulders.

          Is that your song, dear?

          I guess so.

      DRE'S IN THE ZONE, doing his thing on the turntables, mixing,

      Dre, lost in the music, doesn't respond -- Jinx holds up two
      ALBUM COVERS: The Ohio Players' FUNKY WORM and The
      Headhunters' GOD MADE ME FUNKY. Doesn't make sense, yet --

                    JERRY HELLER
          Hey fellas, sorry I'm running late.
          I'll be honest. We've had a lot of
          passes. People are scared of you
          guys big time. They think you're
          dangerous. But I think that's a
          good thing. And we've had a couple
          nibbles, from a couple labels.
          Epic, Capitol, Priority...

                    REN
          "Nibbles"..? What's that mean?

Jerry pauses a beat, finding the best response.

                    JERRY HELLER
          Here's the thing. You guys can make
          a real record. Sell it nationwide.
          But we're not there yet. These
          labels, they're still gonna need
          some... convincing. So I invited a
          few of them to your show. So you
          have to kick ass tonight. Can you
          do that?

The guys stare back at Jerry, with the fire in their eyes.
Goddamn right they can do it -- "Hell yeah!"

     The vibe is positive and laid back, but as we look at Dre's
     face we can tell what he's thinking: something's missing.

     Dre turns to the MOOG Keyboard situated on the side of the
     board and starts noodling with a melody. It's almost
     familiar. But not quite.
                                                               102.


     Then he hits it: Da do dee dah dee dah dah dee do deee...

     Just like that, we've witnessed the birth of AIN'T NUTHIN'
     BUT A G THANG.

                         SNOOP
               Oh shit. Keep playing that.

     Dre does the same ten notes -- That's it! It's G THANG.

                         SNOOP (CONT'D)

               Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at
               the door... (rap continues)

     Just like that, musical history is being created.

     Eazy stares back at Jerry, like indulge me.

          young and ferocious. Doing music
          straight for the hood. Trying to be
          ghetto stars... I thought I knew

          didn't know shit.

          so fast. Feels like it was 20 years
          ago. If we were still together do
          you know how large we'd be?

They both sit there, thinking about that shit, amazed.

          You ever think about fuckin' with
          some new NWA shit?

Cube frowns, contemplates for a moment.

          A footman escorts Elizabeth and the Gardiner's through
          the stupendous library. From the drawing room, the sound
          of a piano playing.. It's the same music Elizabeth played
          at Rosings, but this time played very beautifully.
          Elizabeth is filled with trepidation; we can almost feel
          her heart racing.
          The footman opens the double doors to reveal the
          magnificent drawing room. Darcy is there. So is the
          dreaded Miss Bingley. Seeing her, Elizabeth's polite
          smile falters. Darcy's sister Georgiana plays the piano.

          Coming close, we see them in the moonlight. It's Darcy
          and Elizabeth. Deer turn to gaze at them. The music fades
          as they walk further from the house, up the hill, past
          the outcrops of rocks. An owl hoots. Darcy turns to

          You may as well call it impertinence,
          though make a virtue of it by all means.
          My good qualities are under your
          protection, and you are to exaggerate -
          them as much as possible. And, in return,
          it belongs to me to find occasions for

             guy to heart and soul me and then
             walk away 'cause he can't stand
             the cop thing -- or worse: he
             wants cop stories every night
             'cause it turns him on, and he has
             no idea who I am inside my head.

INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

She is on the floor using an exercise rig, sliding into
crunches, pushing herself, sweating, alone. We BEGIN
DRIFTING TO the rain-spattered window as night sounds
filter in, HORNS, SOMEONE SHOUTING, a CAR MOVING BY with
THUNDEROUS BASS MUSIC that pulses the very air and
RATTLES the LOOSE GLASS of her window.


EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - NIGHT

Catch Lambert is walking the wet streets, head down in
the rain. Far away we hear that car with a BASS-BLASTING
RADIO.

In the glow of a street lamp, Catch sees a bright-colored
object in the gutter. He picks it up out of the gurgling
rain water. It is a small toy, a discarded superhero.
He puts it in his pocket, walks on.

Now the car, the prowling, MUSIC-BLASTING, BASS-
THUNDERING CAR turns a corner and begins rollling along
slowly -- beside Catch. He glances over, walking on.
There are four tough-looking MEN in the car, looking for
trouble. The MUSIC is DEAFENING. Catch glances again,
walks on. Their eyes follow him like gun barrels. He
stops and walks out on the street, moving toward the car,
shouting over the music.

                          CATCH
             Hey! You want to turn that volume
             down? What's your point?

The men, incredulous, stop the car and snap OFF the MUSIC
in order to make sure they're hearing right. They stare
death at Catch.

             Don't you realize there are kids
             trying to sleep in these
             apartments -- old people, sick

They can hardly believe this.

             You better watch your mouth,

Catch meets the man's look with his own unflinching,
haunted eyes.

Catch's look is not a macho challenge. It's something
else -- beyond that, a man somehow without limits. One
of the riders in the backseat taps the Driver's shoulder.

INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT CORRIDOR - SAME NIGHT

Catch is arriving home, soaking wet. He lives in a
slightly-seedy three-story. As he walks down the
corridor toward his apaprtment, he passes a neighbor's
door and notices a set of keys dangling from the lock.
He pauses -- and then knocks softly on the door.

Someone looks through the peephole and then opens the
door -- a young single mother, friendly but with a little
caution, too. She recognizes Catch. Behind her is a
little boy, (five). The woman's name is CANDACE. Her
son is TOMMY.

                         CANDACE
          Hi.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT (LATER THAT NIGHT)

Sharon and Robby are still on the job, their unit rolling
down a residential street of apartment buildings. A
parked car is BLASTING MUSIC, and Robby halts beside it.
Sharon starts making dancing moves to the MUSIC, sitting
there beside Robby, and he stares at her as she grooves,
kidding it. Then Robby HITS the HORN to get the driver's
attention in the parked car. Robby makes a gesture to
lower the volume, and the man SNAPS OFF his TAPE. Robby
rolls on, glancing at Sharon. She wears a small smile,
checking their beat.

                        ROBBY
          What's going on, Pogo?    You're not
          happy or anything?

          Well, it's a mix, Robby. Life is
          shit, but I'm dating this great
          dead guy.

She smiles at Robby's look.

             He says before I came along, he
             thought he was dead. Sounds

            Gonna be good having you back,
            Catch.

Catch comes to the edge of the bandstand, grinning a bit
at Sharon, at his surprise for her, nervously fingering
the horn. He puts it to his lips.


ON SHARON

Mouth-open surprise -- and then smiling with the wonder -
- and Catch begins to play, closing his eyes and
rendering a ballad, like the haunting "ANGEL EYES."

Sharon's smile slowly fades, replaced by a much deeper
look, not only because he is so good, but because he is
showing her his heart, his love and even his pain -- more
than he can show her any other way. We INTERCUT as he
opens his eyes briefly, watching her, sending her the
music, closing his eyes again to fall into the song -- as
Sharon's eyes fill at the beauty and sadness of it, and
at this look inside her man. We LINGER. Then...

We keep the sound of CATCH'S TRUMPET going as he and
Sharon exit the club and begin to stroll away, arms
around each other. In a moment, he stops. He can't go
another step. He has to kiss her. He holds her face and
comes in for the kiss, and above the music we hear her
say softly.

                          SHARON
            Where I've never been kissed.

He stops and stares a moment, then takes her hand and
walks her out into the middle of the traffic-less
boulevard and there, in the center of the street, kisses
her, and she responds, and it is their finest, fullest
moment, lifting on the MUSIC, and it is ironic and
prophetic that at its peak they are washed over by the
revolving light from a police car and a SIREN that CHIRPS
once as they break, staring.

Sharon laughs aloud and walks (with Catch in hand) to the

gestures behind them at the jazz club.

INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Sharon is in the report room, using the computer,
hunting. We MOVE AROUND to see her and the screen. She
is searching the police records to find the accident.
The CONTINUING TRUMPET RIFFS are the motor for this. She
suddenly stops as we FOCUS ON the name: "LAMBERT." Then
we watch her as she punches up the data and she reads.

We MOVE THROUGH Sharon's nearly dark apartment, its
stillness in strange contrast to the manic TRUMPET RIFFS.
We PAN to find her curled in a chair, staring deeply,
sadly, drinking a drink. As we PAN, we DISCOVER she is
looking at that mural of the mountains and through this
to her thoughts, and then she makes a decision and rises
and goes to the phone, punches in a number.

There is a scattering of laughter -- almost by rote -- as
Sharon enters her car without even the hint of a smile.
Robby notices. She just punches up the CAD monitor, all
business. Our TRUMPET MUSIC comes in, aching now, and
takes us into...


INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

She is exercising on the machine, sliding into her
crunches, fast and furious, but all the pain and sorrow
is in her eyes, and in a moment she just stops. The
TRUMPET MUSIC KEEPS GOING ON through this. She looks
over at the phone.


INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

We PAN OVER Bob-the-Dog, watching something. We see a
few scattered sheets of music lying about, hearing
RUSTLING, and we ARRIVE AT Catch, seated on the floor,

searching.

Sharon's voice comes on his machine, almost hollow with
sorrow.

          Catch.  Can you... pick up?
                 (pause)
          Will you call me?

He keeps searching, seeming to not even    listen. The
MACHINE CLICKS OFF. He shakes the next     music chart and
something falls out. He stares at this     piece of paper,
picks it up, slowly turns it over. It     is a picture of
himself, a man blowing a horn, drawn in    crayon by a four
or five-year-old. Catch stares at this     with a depth that
goes on forever, as the MUSIC ENDS.

There is a scattering of laughter -- almost by rote -- as
Sharon enters her car without even the hint of a smile.
Robby notices. She just punches up the CAD monitor, all
business. Our TRUMPET MUSIC comes in, aching now, and
takes us into...


INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

She is exercising on the machine, sliding into her
crunches, fast and furious, but all the pain and sorrow
is in her eyes, and in a moment she just stops. The
TRUMPET MUSIC KEEPS GOING ON through this. She looks
over at the phone.


INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

We PAN OVER Bob-the-Dog, watching something. We see a
few scattered sheets of music lying about, hearing
RUSTLING, and we ARRIVE AT Catch, seated on the floor,
shuffling through a stack of sheet music, driven, looking
for something. The PHONE RINGS. He ignores it. He is
opening up each chart of music, shaking it out,
searching.

Sharon's voice comes on his machine, almost hollow with

             That's his way. That's his way
             through all this. He made a wall
             -- around that whole day, that
             night -- other things, too. He
             keeps them behind the wall -- his
             little boy, my daughter. He can't
             help it. The cemetery?! Do you
             know how hard it is for me to go
             to the cemetery? Can you imagine?

Sharon is shaken by this, realizing, crumbling a bit as
Mrs. Chu goes on.

                           ELANORA
             That's where it stares you in the
             face -- the loss. And it's too
             much sometimes.

Elanora takes a breath, acknowledging how upset she is.

                           ELANORA
             See? I'm still finding my way
             through it. And Catch -- it
             almost kills him to think about it
             or say it or drive a car or see
             the place where it happened or...
             go by the cemetery.

                           SHARON
             I was trying to help him... come
             back to some kind of life. I...

                           ELANORA
             But he was coming back. Do you
             realize how much he changed in the
             past weeks? His apartment, his
             life, his music is coming back.
             He fell in love! He even got a
             job, Sharon -- for you. For the
             two of you. Isn't that coming
             back? Why do you have to rush?
             Everybody has to rush these days.

Sharon, battered by the truth of this, is totally exposed
now, realizing, admitting.

                           SHARON
             I was scared. I push so hard...
             when I'm scared.

             else can we do? You think    I'm
             always sure what to say to   him,
             what not to say? I do what    I
             think is right and hope he   sees
             the love in it.

She shakes her head at Sharon's tears, her warmth showing
now, liking this girl.

                           ELANORA
             Look at you -- so worried now, so
             miserable. That's the love in it.

                           SHARON
             Did I... make it worse for him?

             I don't know. I really don't.
             But I think he'll see the love in
             what you did.

Sharon stares, without much hope. She puts out her hand
to touch Elanora's, to say goodbye. Elanora takes her
hand and holds on a moment, staring into the girl, with
strength. Sharon nods and walks off, dark and sad.
Elanora watches her go.


INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - DAY

It's the next day, and Sharon is preparing to go to her
parents' renewal of vows. She is at the bottom -- with
Catch gone from her life -- but she is doing her best to
go through with this.

We START ON a table, looking at the invitation and next
to that is a wrapped gift. We hear Sharon moving about,
see her nervous, half-dressed, speaking to herself. In
the b.g. we hear our TRUMPET-BASED MUSIC. Very soulful.

                           SHARON
             I just came by to... wish you
             well. To... congratulate you and
             wish you well. Shit.

perhaps 50 people sit in the front pews, watching the

few back from the altar. The slight disturbance of
people sliding over to let her in causes a few people to

          But I got another complaint. And
          it's starting to piss me off.

                  Up there? Oh, no one will go near
                  it...

     She turns to him, something a little intense and probing
     about her gaze.

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  People think it's haunted.

                             TODD
                  Haunted?

     She holds his gaze.

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  And who's to say they're wrong? ...
                  You see, years ago, something happened
                  up there. Something not very nice...
     The flickering flame from the fire begins to cast a more
     intense red glow on her face...

                            MRS. LOVETT
                  There was a barber and his wife,
                  And he was beautiful,
                  A proper artist with a knife,
                  But they transported him for life.
                      (Sighs)
                  And he was beautiful...

     The music continues as she looks at him, again with that
     rather intense gaze:

     The music swells as Anthony emerges from the dark alley into
     the bright sunlight. He makes his way along the sidewalk:

     the street from Turpin's mansion, bravely gazing up at
     Johanna's window.

21   EXT. STREET LEADING TO ST. DUNSTAN'S MARKETPLACE -- DAY        21

     Sweeney Todd and Mrs. Lovett are moving quickly, she
     struggles to keep up with his long, loping stride. He carries
     his razor case, she carries a shopping basket.

                            TODD
                  He's here every Thursday?

                  Like clockwork. Eyetalian. All the
                  rage he is.

                            TODD
                  Not for long.

               Smells like -- phew!

                         TODD
               This is piss. Piss with ink.

     The music speeds up -- Toby is getting desperate:

                         TOBY
               Let Pirelli's
               Activate your roots, sir--

                         TODD
               Keep it off your boots, sir--
               Eats right through.

                         TOBY
               Yes, get Pirelli's!
               Use a bottle of it!
               Ladies seem to love it--

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Flies do too!

     Suddenly, the curtains on the caravan are dramatically flung
     wide to reveal--

     PIRELLI, a flamboyant Italian with a velvet suit, thick wavy
     hair and a dazzling smile. Pirelli poses splendidly for a
     moment. Then:

               You see these razors?

                         MRS. LOVETT
                   (to the crowd)
               The finest in England.

                         TODD
                   (glaring at Pirelli)
               I lay them against five pounds you are
               no match for me. You hear me, sir?
               Either accept my challenge or reveal
               yourself as a sham.

                         MRS. LOVETT
               Bravo, bravo.

     The crowd is enjoying this now, whispering eagerly about the
     bold challenge. In the crowd, we see a quick flash of the
     meek TOURIST we saw earlier.

     Pirelli studies the razors for a moment and then turns to the
     crowd with a confident smile:
                         PIRELLI
               You hear zis foolish man? Watch and
               see how he will regret his folly!

     Music begins as Todd moves into action, preparing the
     challenge:

                         TODD
               Friends, who's for a free shave?

     Two men step forward. A plain wooden chair is brought for
     Todd as he moves into the boldest part of this plan...

     He carefully turns to ... The Beadle.

                         TODD
               Will Beadle Bamford be the judge?

               Who in this wide world is not familiar
               with the honored Judge Turpin?

     The Judge grunts and glances around the shop:

                         JUDGE
               These premises are hardly
               prepossessing and yet the Beadle tells
               me you are the most accomplished of
               all the barbers in the city.

                         TODD
               That is gracious of him, sir ...
                   (indicates for the Judge
                    to sit)
                ... Sit, if you please, sir. Sit.

     The Judge settles into the parlor chair as music begins...

                         TODD
               And what may I do for you today, sir?
               A stylish trimming of the hair? A
               soothing skin massage?

                         JUDGE
               You see, sir, a man infatuate with love,
               Her ardent and eager slave.
               So fetch the pomade and pumice stone
               And lend me a more seductive tone,

     ready -- we are sure the great moment has come -- the music
     still builds -- Todd finally puts the razor at the Judge's
     throat--

                 Johanna elope with you? Deceiving
                 slut! -- I'll lock her up in some
                 obscure retreat where neither you nor
                 any other vile creature shall ever lay
                 eyes on her again--!

     He spins with venom to Todd:

                           JUDGE
                 And as for you, barber, it is all too
                 clear what company you keep. Service
                 them well and hold their custom -- for
                 you'll have none of mine.

     He strides out.

     Todd stands, frozen.

                           ANTHONY
                 Mr. Todd -- you have to help me --
                 I've talked to Johanna and--!

     Todd suddenly turns on him with a ferocious ROAR:

                           TODD
                 OUT! OUT, I SAY!

     Utterly stunned at his friend's ferocity, Anthony backs away,
     leaves the shop.

     Music begins, very agitated, as Todd stands motionless.

     In shock.

     His mind cracking apart.
     Mrs. Lovett hurries in:

                           MRS. LOVETT
                 All this shouting and running about,
                 what's happened--?

                           TODD
                 I had him -- and then--

                           MRS. LOVETT
                 The sailor busted in, I know, I saw
                 them both running down the street and
                 I said--

     Todd interrupts wildly:

               And he'll never come again!

               Easy now.
               Hush, love, hush.
               I keep telling you--

               You told me to wait!
               Now he'll never come again...

     The music becomes ferocious as Todd's wrenching insanity,
     always close to the surface, finally explodes:

                         TODD
               There's a hole in the world
               Like a great black pit
               And it's filled with people
               Who are filled with shit
               And the vermin of the world
               Inhabit it--
               But not for long!

     He suddenly looks to Mrs. Lovett -- she starts back --
     alarmed by the pure madness in his eyes--

                         TODD
               They all deserve to die!
               Tell you why, Mrs. Lovett,
               Tell you why:
               Because in all of the whole human race, Mrs. Lovett
               There are two kinds of men and only two.
               There's the one staying put
               In his proper place

               Well, yes, of course, we could do
               that. I don't suppose he's got any
               relatives going to come poking around

     claustrophobic series of steps down to the bakehouse. She
     unbolts and pulls aside a heavy iron door and enters.

     We remain outside. A fiery red glow spills out -- the roar of
     the oven within is thundering.

     The remains of a nice picnic lunch are scattered around them

     Mrs. Lovett watches happy couples moving about ... dogs and
     kids running hither and yon ... military officers squiring
     their ladies ... nurses with prams...

     Todd is distinctly ill at ease, brooding, as she chatters:

               Hoo! Hoo!

     Music continues as Todd joins them. He kneels with Toby to
     help him work on the sandcastle. Mrs. Lovett stands, watching
     them, the picture of the doting mother.

      horrible catacomb of decaying sewers. Todd carries a razor.
      Their voices echo bizarrely:

                             MRS. LOVETT
                   Toby!
                   Where are you, love?

                             TODD
                   Toby!
                   Where are you, lad?

111   INT. BARBER SHOP -- NIGHT                                     111
      Anthony and Johanna hurry into the barber shop. She is now
      dressed as a scruffy boy, a cap hiding her hair. She is
      distracted and disturbed.

                             ANTHONY
                   Mr. Todd...? No matter. You wait for
                   him here -- I'll return with the coach
                   in less than half an hour...

      She gently touches Todd's collection of razors...

                   Don't worry, darling, in those
                   clothes, no one will recognize you ...
                   You're safe now.

                   Beadle ... Beadle...

      Johanna looks around urgently, sees the large chest. She
      quickly climbs into it and shuts the lid as--

      The Beggar Woman enters.

                             BEGGAR WOMAN
                   Beadle dear, Beadle...

      The room has a strange effect on her, as if she were vaguely
      recalling some distant dream. She intones to pretty lullaby
      music...

      SUDDENLY--

      Without warning -- like a thunderbolt -- Todd leaps into the
      room--

      He looks anxiously out the window for the Judge:

                     now)
                Hey, don't I know you, mister?

      Todd suddenly sees -- the Judge! -- walking toward the shop--
      Todd has no time--!

      The music THUNDERS as--

      In one brutal motion -- he swings around and grabs his razor -
      - fiercely SLASHES her throat -- tosses her in the chair --
      pulls the lever -- she slides through the floor--

      He pulls the chair back to its normal position just as--

      The Judge enters.

                          JUDGE
                Where is she? Where's the girl?

                longing for forgiveness.

      They sing simultaneously as Todd smoothes bay rum on the
      Judge's face and then reaches for his razor:

                          JUDGE
                Pretty women!

                Blowing out their candles

                Then they leave--
                Even when they leave you
                And vanish, they somehow
                Can still remain

                   dress, but he's finished now...

      She continues quickly dragging the Beggar Woman toward the
      oven.

                   Leave them to me. Open the doors.

                   What's the matter with you? It's only
                   a silly old beggar--
      Then -- Mrs. Lovett opens the oven doors--

      The thundering roar from the oven crashes through the room as
      the fiery light slashes across the floor--

      Clearly illuminating the face of the Beggar Woman.

      A chord of music as Todd realizes who she is. Music continues
      and builds as:

                             TODD
                   Oh no! ... Oh God ... "Don't I know

      He stands alone.

          Behold gentlemen.  The power of the
          wind!

As the sails billow the Albatross seems transformed.
Everyone stops and looks up.  The vessel heels and with a
powerful surge, launches into the waves.  White foam
splashes over the bowsprit as the hull thunders through
the water.  Chuck's face is full of wonder.  It is a
magical moment.  Then the crew begins to cheer.

LONG SHOT

The Albatross under full sail is the handsome, powerful
image of another time.  And yet, here she is.

ON DECK

Each of the boys is awed by the majesty of this moment.
Music builds.

          Chart us a course for the windward
          side.

          blue water.


EXT.  THE OPEN SEA - LATER

The bow of the Albatross explodes through the top of a
fifteen foot swell.  The sky is clear but the wind is
fierce.  In spite of the seas the ship is trimmed and
sailing well.

The crew has never seen mountains of water like this.
Disaster seems imminent.  Bill has assembled them in front
of the wheel house.  They are all holding on for dear
life.  Even John seems shaken.  Skipper magically stands
effortlessly before them on the rolling deck.  He remains
perfectly dry.

                         SKIPPER
          He never would have believed a woman

Alice smiles and turns back to the dancers.

          Do you remember the last time you
          and I danced under the stars?

          On the deck of the Yankee, the night
          you asked me to marry you.  We
          weren't much older than they are.

The music changes to a calypso waltz.  Skipper takes Alice
by the hand.

                         SKIPPER
          Would you allow me?

She's sixteen again.  There's something about him that
still makes her blush.

Skipper leads her to the dance floor.  He hesitates,
looking deeply into her eyes.  As they begin to dance, the
boys notice and exchange looks.

Lawford and George sit across the quad, sipping punch and
smoking cigars.

The same sunset, but from another time.  Four young men
walk along a deserted beach.  A small boat has beached and
rocks gently in the shallows.  The boys run up and look at
it.  On the stern are painted the words:  BRIGANTINE
ALBATROSS.

SLOWLY PULL BACK to reveal endless white sand, blue water,
the young men and the boat.

                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)
          Some time later we learned that one
          of our long boats had been
          recovered.  Several young men found
          it washed up on a nameless beach
          somewhere on the island of
          Hispaniola.  No one seemed to know
          who they were or where they came
          from, but they seemed to know of the
          Albatross.
                  (pause)
          Sometimes in my dreams those
          faceless young men reveal themselves
          as my lost companions, and on the
          twilight coral sands of forever,
          between my slumber and conscious
          state, we race naked again, so open
          and in love with those precious

          bled and angry with himself and the world, he takes off his top hat and
          considers putting his fist through it, but jams it back on his head. A horse-

          Levin is the spirit of consumptive, bohemian radicalism. He peers at Levin,

	Jack crosses the street and waves up to his apartment
	building, where a black labrador is studying him from

	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT

	Jack's apartment is small, old, and comfortably
	cluttered.  The most striking item is a vintage phone
	booth placed against the wall.  As Jack lets himself in,
	EDDIE, the dog from the window, walks over.  He is not
	an overly enthusiastic dog, but you can see from his
	face that he has a great deal of affection for Jack.

		Hi, pal.  Thought you were gonna clean the

	and hands it over.

		Take it easy, will ya?  You're becoming a regular
		Johhny Appleseed the way you're dropping teeth

	Jack hangs his tie on the phone booth and walks over
	to an old phonograph stacked six deep with discs.  
	He lifts the records back up the post and clicks ON the
	MACHINE.  As Bill Evans' smoky "PEACE PIECE" fills the
	tiny apartment, Jack breaks the collar of his shirt and
	walks over to the old piano near the window.  Settling
	back with the bottle of whiskey, Jack rests his elbows
	gently on the keys and stares out the open window,
	listening to the music.

	and a moment after that, Susie.  Unfortunately,
	Jack and Frank, accustomed to playing alone,

		And it's especially nice to be among friends

		Well, it's frightening.  You could be his twin.

	the applause.


				HENRY
		Thank you.  As most of you know, we like to shake
		things up here every so often just to keep you
		people on your toes.  So I'm gonna take a little
		rest, grab myself a drink, and let an old friend sit
		in.  He drops by about once a year just to keep
		his hands clean.  Ladies and gentlemen.  
		Jack Baker.

	Jack rises to polite applause and shakes Henry's hand.  
	As he settles behind the piano, he sits for a moment,
	not moving, then nods to the two men behind him.  As they
	begin to play, we recognize the music from the record.  
	Jack waits, then brings his hands to the keys.  As he
	plays, his face is suddenly calm.  Peaceful.

	Later.  Jack comes out of the club and into the night,
	lighting a cigarette as he moves up the street.

				SUSIE (O.S.)
		You were good.

	Jack stops.  Susie.

				JACK
		I can keep the beat.

				SUSIE
		Better than that.

	Jack's face goes a little cold, but he says nothing,
	beginning to walk again.

    SCRATCH, 10 years old, has a `DIDDLEY BOW', a piece of baling
    wire nailed to the side of the unpainted shack so it is
    stretched taut. He moves an old corn cob under it as a fret
    and makes TWANGY, pitch-shifting NOTES as he plucks the wire.

    His friend LONNIE stands moving his fingers over a BOARD he
    has laid on the side of the porch floor. A few scrawny
    CHICKENS run around in the yard behind them-

                        LONNIE
              Leave off with that, Scratch.

              Yes it is.     That aint no kind of

          That's how they called em. They
          must of had all their African kinda
          instruments- drums, shakers, some
          kind of banjo thing- but the piano-

          The piano was just sittin there in
          the white folks' big room, all
          polished up-- and I figure this
          one boy, he goes past fifteen,
          twenty times a day, running the
          corner of his eye over it. And
          he's there when they play, the
          masters, doin all their minuets and
          whatever-

          have a thought in his head, might
          be only some dust hangin in the air
          for all they know- but he's
          watchin the fingers, see, watchin
          them keys work. This old boy, the
          first one, he can play alla them
          Africa kinda instruments, he can
          play mud if you give him the key
          and the tempo, he's got music in
          his head, in his heart, in every
          damn piece of him there's music.

          huntin foxes or some rich white

          he's alone in the room with that
          piano and he comes over and sits
          down on the bench-

               in their somber best, filing into the mortuary for a service. 
               The music - "Shall We Gather At The River?" - is issuing

               as we approach, down the aisle of a country chapel, an open 
               wooden coffin. Sad country faces turn, looking at us from

               HIGH ANGLE on Sgt. Tate as he leads a five-man squad, all in 
               bulletproof vests, up the stone stairs. They move fast but 
               carefully, covering each other from landing to landing with 
               drawn revolvers, shotguns. The distant Back MUSIC makes a 
               ghostly echo in here...

               SGT. TATE

               approaches very cautiously, gun aimed. The other cops, behind 
               him, fan out silently to set up angles of fire, checking the 
               various office doors - all locked - as they creep up.

               to point his gun inside. It's empty. He backs away.

MARY
You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd 
love to serve your balls to those Red Coats 
for lunch! Think about it!

RHODES
No, Miss Science. You're the one who needs 
to do some thinking.

He turns and walks away. MARY stands still for a time, THE SOUND OF 
RHODES' CLICKING BOOTHEELS surrounding her, swallowing her. In the 
DEEP BACKGROUND we can HEAR THE MOANS OF THE CAGED DEAD.

86	INT. THE CENTRAL CHAMBERS OF THE CAVE - NIGHT

MONTAGE: as MARY walks through HUGE OPEN AREAS CARVED OUT OF NATURAL 
ROCK. We are stunned at the enormity of the place. JEEPS AND TRUCKS 
RUMBLE back and forth. Storage areas hold MOUNTAINS OF CRATES, 
CARTONS, WATER AND GAS CANISTERS. FORK LIFTS shift loads from here to 
there.

MARY comes to a place where the natural rock surrenders to man-made 
walls. She enters past TWO SECURITY GUARDS, showing her I.D.

87	INT. THE RESIDENCE - NIGHT

MARY moves down A CORRIDOR with NUMBERED DOORS on both sides. We HEAR 
THE SOUND OF LIFE, MUSIC BLASTING, VOICES LAUGHING, ARGUING, CRYING. 
PEOPLE move by. A MAN AND A WOMAN are fighting. She slaps him, he 
punches her, she kicks him in the balls. THREE HOOKERS pound on a 
door. The door is opened by A NAKED MAN WEARING A DILDO on his nose. 
OTHER MEN, behind him, laugh wildly as the hookers enter their smoke-
filled room.

MARY stops in her tracks when she sees that outside A DOOR NUMBERED 
83 (the door to her quarters) there are TWO OF RHODES' SOLDIERS with 
RIFLES in hand. The door itself is open and SHADOWS move inside.

MARY turns quickly, before she is spotted, and starts back through 
the hallway. As she turns a corner she is grabbed by TOBY TYLER.

MARY
Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find 
out what's goin' on.

TOBY
Hey. Slow down. What is it?

MARY
Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.

TOBY
That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his 
move so fast.

JOHN
We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave 
entrance number five.

TOBY
That entrance is closest to the labs and 
the Bee cages.

JOHN
Come on. Let's go.

They move off stealthily.

They enter the clearing with the spectacular PLANTS that Miguel 
discovered. Six feet tall, their red-gold blossoms like trumpets with 
their bells down, these are Daturas, nightshades indigenous to 
southern Florida and parts of the Caribbean.

SALLY AND JACK, who we saw working on the nitro sticks, are chopping 
off the eighteen-inch blossom and stuffing them into LARGE LEAF BAGS. 
They're wearing HOSPITAL MASKS over their mouth and noses. JOHN moves 
in to help. TOBY AND SARAH follow but JOHN stops them.

JOHN
Just stand guard for now. Spell us after a 
while. Can't breathe this grass too long or 
somebody hafta carry you home.

Work goes on in silence.

111	EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE THE RITZ - NIGHT

MUSIC ROCKS AND VOICES SHOUT. The street scene is as wild as ever. 
HOOKERS, PUSHERS AND DRUNKS pack the hot darkness.

112	INT. THE RITZ - NIGHT

At A COT near the open wall, in DIM LIGHT FROM AN OVERHEAD BULB 
OUTSIDE, SARAH, JOHN AND TOBY huddle. The DIN from the street makes 
it impossible for others to hear them. TOBY is drawing A MAP.

TOBY
Maintenance shafts run behind all the main 
rooms. Nobody's in those at night. You can 
use them to get around in. Hit the power 
governors first. Kick a surge into their 
computer network and you erase everything 
stored in the memory. Then...over in 
here...that's where the cages are...

On the street outside, a puffing BILL McDERMOTT pushes through the 
unruly crowd, his face showing alarm.

McDERMOTT
The Doc's gone. Diesel and Jack and Spider 
with him. They took the guns... and the 
nitro.

Amen.

170	EXT. THE BEACH - NIGHT

THE CORPSE lies in the MOONLIGHT. NIGHT CRITTERS SCREECH AND BURBLE 
in the jungle behind the sand. It's an eerie scene.

SARAH is sitting up, her RIFLE ready in her lap, watching the body. 
JOHN steps in behind and she startles.

JOHN
Just me. I'll take the next shift.

He settles easily down beside the woman. The two stare together at 
the shrouded corpse.

SARAH
How long do we have to watch him?

JOHN
Forever, darlin'. Forever. 'Til he turns ta 
dust and blows away on the wind.

THE BODY lies silent, rigid under the KHAKI ARMY BLANKET that rises 
and falls, rises and falls with the Gulf breeze.

Suddenly...A LOUD MUSIC CHORD! A SUDDEN MOVEMENT!

It's the movement of RED LETTERS that spin up off the head of the 
corpse and settle before our eyes.

The letters read: "THE END (I PROMISE)"

          HOLIDAY, 35, African-American, a clean-cut lawyer, maybe
          horn rims, starting to grey, sits at a table with RUSSIAN
          OIL EXECS. The LEADER eats ribs with tiny teeth.

          Are you a director or executive of

          Ali cruises toward the address, dressed in her Iowa best,
          full of confidence. She rounds a corner and sees:

          A LONG LINE OF 165 GORGEOUS, IMPECCABLY GROOMED GIRLS.
          Ali stops in her tracks. Tougher competition than she was
          expecting. She heads for the back of the line, passing girls
          doing vocal warm-ups. One girl is belting out a riveting
          "SOMEWHERE OVER THE RAINBOW". Just as Ali gets in line, the
          door opens and a SKINNY GUY sticks his head out.

                         SKINNY GUY
          Sorry, ladies, that's all the

          The Bumper Band plays as Ali makes her way back toward the

          Ali sees ANOTHER TABLE OF CHIC CLUBSTERS trying to get the
          waitress's attention. The Waitress ignores them.
          Ali sees the trays on the end of the bar. She grabs one, goes
          to the TABLE OF CLUBSTERS, clears their empties, takes their
          order. She finds Jack at the bar, unloads the empties.

          She heads back to the bar with empties, eyes glued to the
          stage, where Coco and the GIRLS are dancing to "Wagon Wheel

          She heads back to the bar. As Jack loads her tray up, she
          stuffs her tips into her pocket-- SEES Sean, looking her up
          and down.

          Okay, girl, time for Sean to give

          O.S. MUSIC UP: "BABY YOU'VE GOT WHAT IT TAKES" by Brook
          Denton and Dinah Washington over...

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - ON STAGE - DAY

          CLOSE ON A HEAVILY MADE-UP GIRL as she screams and drops out
          of the shot in a flying split. Behind her, a ROW OF DANCERS
          do the same. Typical, fantastic, old-school can-can.
          WIDEN to see Tess and Sean, on the floor, auditioning them.
          The club is brightly lit, none of its evening aura.
          Scattered around the club are other HOPEFULS in groups,
          waiting for their turn.

          MUSIC CONTINUES OVER:

          EXT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - DAY

          Jack's motorcycle pulls up to the club, with Jack driving,
          and Ali riding on back.

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - DAY

          Ali and Jack enter as the auditions are under way. As they
          set up the bar, Ali watches the stage, intrigued.
          MONTAGE: the dancers auditioning, in small groups. All
          shapes, sizes. Ali watching. Finally only a few are left.

          Okay, front row, thank you very
          much.
          They walk off stage, dismissed. Tess turns to Sean.

          You know every number.

                         ALI
          Which one do you wanna see?
          Tess looks at her in disbelief.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          I said, which one do you wanna see?
          Ali just stares at her. Calling her bluff, Tess yells up to
          DAVE in the sound booth--

                         TESS
          Tough Lover!
          Tess plops down in a booth-- crosses her arms indignantly.
          ON STAGE, the music starts. Ali readies herself, starts to
          dance. Behind a beat to two. She's got the steps right, but
          it isn't clicking. She's thinking too hard. No personality.
          After a few measures, Tess has seen enough.

                         TESS (CONT'D)
          Okay then, next?

                         ALI
          Hang on.
          (to Dave in the booth)
          Start it again, please?
          As Dave resets the music. Ali regroups: takes her hair down
          and shakes it loose.
          Nikki ENTERS, SEES Ali on stage--

                         NIKKI

          Shhhh.
          On stage, Ali takes a beat; inhales, breathing in attitude.
          Then she looks up at the booth again.

                         ALI
          Anytime.
          The MUSIC starts in again. And this time, Ali comes alive.
          She may not have perfect technique or the best extension, but
          she exudes an ambition and sexuality no one has seen from her
          before. It's like she becomes a woman before our eyes. She
          misses a step or two, but who the hell cares?
          On the floor, Sean gapes, eyes popping. Tess is poker-faced.
          Coco and Georgia's expressions turn from dubious to
          respectful. Nikki's eyes narrow.
          At the bar, Jack freezes, a huge rack of glasses in his arms -
          - unable to tear his eyes away.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.
          As the SONG CLIMAXES, Ali finishes with an alluring toss of
          her ass, then lands in a sexy layout on a chair, owning the
          stage. The music ends. A stunned silence. The only sound
          is Ali's heavy breathing.
          Then Georgia jumps up, APPLAUDING EFFUSIVELY.

                         NIKKI
          What are so you happy about, that's
          your replacement.

                         GEORGIA
          Yeah, but she's really good.
          Tess and Ali are in a stare down.

                         TESS
          I want so badly to say something
          bitchy, but nothing's coming.

                         SEAN
          There's a first.
          Tess sighs, not wanting to give Ali any props.

          LOVER. UH-HA...
          Coco and Scarlett chime in on back-up. Hearing them, Jessie
          and Anna join in as well. Ali takes off, holding nothing
          back. The girls feed off her confidence, and soon all of
          them are hitting the backs of their cabaret chairs, stomping
          their feet to the music. The girls singing back-up.
          In his seat, Marcus sits up a little straighter -- suddenly
          paying more attention. Unable to take his eyes off Ali.
          The BAND plays along. The BARTENDERS accompany them with
          hand-claps. All except Jack, who's too spellbound to move.

                         ALI (CONT'D)

          ON THE FLOOR, Nikki watches, aghast, as the crowd engages
          like we've never seen them.

          The room ERUPTS IN APPLAUSE, knowing they caught a once-in-a-
          lifetime performance. Marcus stands, clapping, whistling.
          Ali basks in it, jubilant, rapturous. She glances to the
          wings and sees Sean, clapping and jumping in place. Then she
          sees Tess beside him, stone-faced.

          The Girls exit the stage in a flurry, everyone congratulating

          Don't know. Hasn't happened yet.
          They stand there, close to each other. Jack sees a strand of
          hair caught in the earring. He pulls it away, freeing it.
          His fingers move through her hair. She closes her eyes,
          feeling his fingers against her neck.
          Then she opens her eyes, looks at him. He looks back, unable
          to look away. Until:
          His CELL PHONE RINGS. Breaking the mood. He pulls it from
          his pocket. Checks who's calling. Looks back at Ali.

                         JACK
          I should... it's... Natalie.
          Ali steps away from him, disappointed. He answers the phone.

          Hey, babe, how are you?
          Ali watches him walk away from her, falling into the
          conversation with Natalie.

Erica's French Songs, "I Wish You Love".

                    HARRY

              (sings)
          I wish you bluebirds in the spring... To
          Give your heart a song to sing... And
          then a kiss, but more than this... I wish
H         you love...
 arry takes out a sheet of paper and his glasses.

                    HARRY

Now Harry sings the rest of the song IN FRENCH. . .

Erica and Zoe are taking a walk. Erica, still crying, picks
up a brown stone, explains its meaning to Zoe. Zoe holds the
stone, makes an `awwww' face.Erica nods, then Zoe tosses the
stone in the ocean, fed up with hearing about him already.
Then, Zoe stops Erica, points to something.

MARIN AND HER NEW BOYFRIEND

frolicking on the beach. He's a YOUNG HUNK in a tank top,

INT. DINING ROOM - LATER - MUSIC OVER

Candlelit. Zoe, Erica and Julian share a bottle of wine and a
home cooked meal. The CAMERA does a 360 around the table,
their faces saying it all. The Women bask in Julian's warmth
as he entertains them with stories. Zoe looks from Julian to
Erica, relieved to see her sister smiling again.

INT. KITCHEN - LATER

Erica places coffee cups in the sink. Julian is next to her,
leaning against the counter, holding a glass of wine.

                    ERICA

          Julian, I hope you know I'm
          mortified by my behavior. I was
          going to get in touch with you,
          send you a note or something...

                    JULIAN

          A note? That's a little chilly.

                    ERICA

          I'm embarrassed. I just haven't
          been myself lately. What can I say?

kiss that doesn't quit.

              (still holding her,

heart.

ERICA'S COMPUTER SCREEN - ANOTHER NIGHT

On it is written: The lights on the Eiffel Tower dim to black
as the music continues to play.
Erica sits back, still wearing Harry's glasses. Finished at
last. She notices an empty Kleenex box on her desk. She
tosses it in a hook shot across the room and it lands right
in the trash can.

INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Julian sits on the sofa, shoes off, reading the first half of
the play. A fire burns in the fireplace. Erica approaches the
back of the sofa, holding the rest of the pages.

                    JULIAN

          It's the best thing you've ever written.

          It's funny.
Erica leans oyer the sofa, reading over his shoulder.

          Sorry to interrupt again but Dave wants
          to know, when Henry says, "I love ya",
          you want that to be 'Ya', not 'You',
          right?

                    ERICA

          Right.
We now HEAR Louis Armstrong's La Vie En Rose play throughout
the theater. The BEACH backing is 'raised and an EIFFEL TOWER
BACKING is lowered behind them. They both try to ignore the
music, but it's impossible.

Harry, with his collar turned up against the cold, walks past
the glass pyramid in front of The Louvre.

EXT. PONT NEUF - PARIS - MOMENTS LATER

Harry walks over the bridge, the beauty surrounding him just
making it all worse. He stops, looks out at the Seine. He
hears a classic French song in the distance, then sees a
small barge, playing the music, pass beneath him. Without
warning, a tear falls from his eye.

                    HARRY

              (laughs at himself)
          At the end of the day, I'm nothin'
          but a sap, a stupid old sap,
          standing on a bridge in Paris,
          crying my eyes out.
He stops, looks at the mighty city surrounding him. Beauty's
not supposed to hurt. Another tear.

                    HARRY

              (almost amused)
          Look who gets to be the girl.
He wipes his eyes on his coat sleeve as SNOW begins to fall.

	The years go by and they are SUPERIMPOSED as they pass.
	George, clean and sober, enjoying family life.  Healthy and
	happy.  Mr. Mom.  Mirtha looks worse and worse as her habit
	becomes bigger and bigger.  As George and Kristina grow
	closer and closer, Mirtha is stepping out on the town.
	Blowing money right and left.  Shopping with Mirtha, buying
	clothes, furs, and diamonds.  As Kristina gets older, WE SEE
	her birthday parties.  George and Kristina wearing paper hats
	and eating ice cream.  She's two years old, she's three,
	four, five, six...

	INT. EASTHAM HOUSE - 1985 - NIGHT

	The Eastham house is all done up for a party deluxe.  Fully
	catered, with bartenders, waiters, music, the works.  And of
	course the three c's, champagne, caviar and Colombians.
	George is laughing with Augusto and Martha Oliveros, but when
	Derek Foreal appears in the doorway, George excuses himself
	and walks over.

				DEREK
		Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited
		me.

				GEORGE
		Yeah.  She told me.

				DEREK
		Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I
		feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I
		did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me.
		Cut me out, too.

				GEORGE
		I heard.

                         Oh boy! You can't remember anything--
                         the first one, up at the lake. That 
                         was the first time you kissed me--I 
                         practically had to throw myself at 
                         you.

                                     STEVE
                              (quietly)
                         I remember.

               They continue to dance slowly. Laurie starts to cry, hating 
               herself for it. Steve loosens a minute and looks at her.

                                     STEVE
                         What's wrong?

                         Go to hell.

               He holds her tighter and they circle the floor, all alone, 
               the crowd watching quietly, the gym echoing with "Smoke Gets 
               in Your Eyes."

               THE GYM PARKING LOT

               Curt is leaning against a car in the parking lot. He's looking 
               up at the stars and listening to the music floating out from 
               the gym.

                                     WENDY
                         What are you doin', stealing hub 
                         caps?

               A pretty, dark-haired girl, Wendy, slides up next to him and 
               leans against the car. There's an awkward pause like that 
               which happens often when two people who used to be close 
               meet after things have changed.

                                     CURT
                         Well--hey, Wendy.

                                     WENDY
                         How've you been?

                                     CURT
                         Fine. Great. How've you been?

               A horn honks and Wendy turns to a VW that's idling nearby.

            to wait?

                        PUPKIN
            I don't know. Until he gets back.

                        RITA.
            Do we have to just sit here?

                        PUPKIN
            He should be back pretty soon.

                        RITA
            Doesn't he have any music or anything?
            Let's get a little life into this place.
            It's like a funeral parlor.

     She walks over to the stereo and opens the cupboard beneath
     it, revealing rows and rows of records.

                        RITA
            This is more like it.

     She pulls out a record.

                        PUPKIN
            Come on, Rita.

                        RITA
            Come on, yourself.

     She puts the record on. Frank Sinatra starts singing "They
     Can't Take That Away From Me." She takes a big sip of her
     drink, puts it down and comes over to PUPKIN.

                        RITA
            How about a little spin, handsome?

EXT. LAKE TAHOE ESTATE - DAY

The lawns of this great estate on the shore of Lake Tahoe
are covered with guests of a wonderful party to honor the
First Holy Communion of Anthony Corleone, the son of Mr. and
Mrs. Michael Corleone.  A full dance orchestra plays music
of the times on a pavilion bandstand built especially for
the occasion.  Speedboats roar through the water, pulling
youthful waterskiers; and the pool and private harbor are
filled with laughing, swimming guests.  It is Fall of 1958.

MED. VIEW

Anthony, in his Communion suit sits alone at the table,
looking like a lonely young Prince.

				KAY (O.S.)
		Smile, Anthony.  Smile.

He does, and a flash goes off.

		Now, one with the whole family.

KAY CORLEONE enters from the side, leading her four year old
daughter, MARY, and MAMA CORLEONE to pose with Anthony.

		people here.  Friends of Kay's.
		He'll never forgive me if you ruin
		his party.

				DEANNA
		I hate to see you cringe in front
		of him.  How come you're so scared
		of your own kid brother?

				FREDO
		He's the head of the family.

Disgusted, she turns around, and heads toward the music.

				DEANNA
		Don't follow me!

EXT. TAHOE LAWN AND TABLES - MED. SHOT - DAY

Rushing through the tables, waving an arm jangling with gold
jewelry, and carrying several gift-wrapped packages, is a
hardened and aging CONNIE CORLEONE.  She is followed by a
blond, and wrinkled-handsome escort named MERLE.

				CONNIE
		Mama...Mama!  Here I am!

She throws her arms around her Mother, who returns the
affection somewhat reproachfully.

				MAMA
		Constanzia.  We expected you last
		week; we sent the car to pick you
		up at the airport last week.

EXT. TAHOE PAVILION - MED. VIEW - DAY

The orchestra wears white summer sportcoats and black tuxedo
slacks as they play a tango behind monogrammed music stands.
A professional dance team, probably imported from Vegas,
dance the tango for the excited guests.

INT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - DAY

A large and very beautiful room overlooking the lake.  It is
dominated by an enormous bar, behind which stands ALBERT
NERI, discreetly in the background.

MICHAEL CORLEONE sits on a large sofa, his back to us.
Standing to one side is a tired and somewhat uneasy TOM
HAGEN.  Standing before Michael is SANDRA CORLEONE, Sonny's
widow; her daughter, one of the twins, FRANCESCA CORLEONE,
and a handsome young man of twenty, GARDNER SHAW.

				SANDRA
		Michael, this is Gardner Shaw.
		Francesca and he have been seeing
		each other for six months now.
		Gardner, this is Francie's Uncle
		Michael.

				GARDNER
			(a little nervous)
		I've heard a lot about you, Mr.
		Corleone.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		Sit down.  Francie.

The couple sit themselves on the sofa opposite Michael.

		It was my father's money; and I'm
		entitled to what I need.  Where is
		Tom Hagen?

She turns angrily, leaving Michael standing face to face
with Merle.

				MICHAEL
		Are you finished?

				MERLE
		I think so.

				MICHAEL
		Then out.

Merle puts out his cigarette and leaves, quickly.

EXT. TAHOE PAVILION - FULL VIEW - DAY

The orchestra has struck up a "Paul Jones," where two
concentric circles of young people march in opposite
directions, until the music stops.  Then they take whomever
is opposite them as their new dance partner.

VIEW ON THE HARBOR AREA

Francesca and her twin, Gardner and their elite young
friends roar out of the private harbor, to get up on the
water skis.  We notice ROCCO LAMPONE, move along a path
leading to a separate and more private boathouse.  A small
covered craft approaches, ties off, and a group of three men
step on to the pathway, shake hands with Lampone - and
follow him to the large boathouse where Michael conducts his
business.

CLOSE VIEW

Pentangeli has led Mama up to the dance floor, and is having
some difficulty with the orchestra.

				PENTANGELI
		I can't believe that out of thirty
		professional musicians, not one of
		you is Italian!
			(as the musicians laugh)
		C'mon, give us a tarantella.

He waves his hands, conducting, and singing.  The piano
starts a vamp, the drums uncertainly join in.  A clarinet
starts to play "Pop Goes the Weasel," and soon the rest of
the orchestra is playing that.  They look to Pentangeli for
approval.  Disgusted, he goes back to his table, eating a
handful of canapes.

INT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY

Rocco ushers an older Italian, bundled up against the cold
and wet of his boatride, to Michael.

The man shows respect to Michael, who quickly indicates that
Neri should get him a drink.

Title: Godfather Part II

		...you can have my answer now if

Geary turns back.

				MICHAEL
		My offer is this.  Nothing...not
		even the thousand dollars for the
		Gaming Commission, which I'd
		appreciate if you would put up
		personally.

Geary returns Michael's hard look; then laughs and leaves.
Slowly Michael turns to Hagen.

VIEW ON HAGEN

embarrassed at being so off the mark.

				MICHAEL
		It's all right, Tom, we'll talk
		later.  Tell Frankie Pentangeli I'd
		like him to have dinner at my
		family table before we do business.

EXT. THE PAVILION - NIGHT

Now the light has faltered, and the young waiters have put
up the night lights.  The tables are all properly set for
dinner, with candles on each one.

The orchestra is playing quiet, unobtrusive dinner music,
and many of the guests have begun to help themselves to the
impressive buffet, under a party tent.

MED. VIEW

Michael sits at a large table with Kay, his son Anthony,
Mama, Hagen and TERESA, Connie and Merle' Fredo and Deanna,
and Frankie Pentangeli.

				MAMA
		Cent' Anne.

This, the table of honor, all raise their glasses and repeat
the toast.

				DEANNA
		What's 'cent' Anne?'

				FREDO
		A hundred years...it's a toast.

Title: Godfather Part II
Genres:
Crime, Drama, 
				MICHAEL
		I'm sorry about some of the people
		I had to see today.  It was bad
		timing... but it couldn't be helped.

				KAY
		It made me think of what you told
		me once.  In five years, the
		Corleone family will be completely
		legitimate.  That was seven years
		ago.

He has no answer for her; except that he loves and values
her, and holds her tight, as they dance amid their guests,
all dressed elegantly for the social event of the season.

The VIEW LOOSENS to show the entire, night-lit party.

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. LAS VEGAS CHAPEL - MED. CLOSE VIEW - NIGHT

A Cadillac limousine waits for some people inside the tacky,
Las Vegas marriage mill.

INT. THE CHAPEL - NIGHT

Some quiet, informally dressed couples wait in the rear of
the chapel; some talking, others sitting nervously.

A single organ plays some standard wedding music.

The VIEW PANS up to the altar, where Connie and Merle, in
the same clothing they wore to the Tahoe party, are being
married by a Justice of the Peace.

The Justice goes through the bored, simple ceremony, and we
begin to HEAR an echo of the waltz Connie danced with her
father, when she was married all those years ago in Long
Island.

EXT. THE TROPICANA - LAS VEGAS - MED. VIEW - DAY

A dark car pulls up to the glitter of the neon facade.
Albert Neri, alone, leaves it to the parking valets, and
moves quickly through the automatic doors, into the main
casino.  We still hear the CORLEONE WALTZ.

INT. THE TROPICANA - DAY

Albert Neri enters the room; glances around a moment, and
then heads toward the crap table, where a short, middle-aged
man, KLINGMAN, stands by the pit boss.  Several security
guards of the casino, are at their posts.

				NERI
		Are you Klingman?

				KLINGMAN
		Who's asking?

The starter turns, and the automobile blows in a great
explosion.

EXT. THE TAHOE ESTATE - NIGHT

The waltz continues over the VIEW of the empty, but still
illuminated pavilion.  There is the debris of the great
party spread over the grounds, which a silent crew of
workmen are at work cleaning up,

MED. VIEW

Michael walks alone, followed by two of the family dogs,
Irish Setters.

He walks to the water line, and looks out across the lake.
He picks up a stick, and throws it for the dogs; who go
scampering after it.

We notice that a respectful distance away, there are
bodyguards watching every move he makes.

CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL

looking across the lake.  There is much on his mind.  The
SOUND of the waltz, begins to segue into the echoed music
and laughter of an old Italian Music Hall from the past.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. NEW YORK THEATRE - 1915 - NIGHT

VITO CORLEONE is a shy young man of 23, holding his hat in
his hand, being led down the crowded aisle of this Italian
Vaudeville theatre by an energetic and fulfilled GENCO
ABBANDANDO, his friend in America.  This entire sequence is
played in Sicilian.

				GENCO
		Come on, you've got to see her!

VIEW ON THE STAGE

A tattered melodrama is in progress in Neapolitan.  The sets
are two-dimensional, and flap whenever there's an entrance
or exit.

The hero, PEPPINO, is weeping as he sings about how he's
left his Mother in Italy, while he is in this new country,
America.

Both Clemenza and Tessio are impressed with their young
friend; his willingness to risk his life on his perception
of the situation.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

A ten piece Italian street band plays in front of the church
to commemorate the first night of the Festa di San Gennaro.
People swarm in crowds, delighted by the music, as out of
the church four men carry the statue of San Gennaro down to
the street.

MOVING VIEW

Clemenza moves along the booths that have been set up along
the street: sausage cooking on an open fire; pork livers and
sweetbeards.  He stops for a sandwich, and makes an irritated
gesture when the vendor expects to be paid.  He crosses to a
church-sponsored booth with a great Wheel of Fortune, and
slaps a dollar on a number.  Standing next to him is Vito;
they embrace.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
			 (quietly)
		All three daughters are at church;
		he is alone.  It's important that
		you let his neighbors see you leave.
		Tessio has broken the latch on the
		skylight of his building.

The wheel stops; they both lose.

				CLEMENZA
			(English)
		See, Brother Carmello, even the
		church makes numbers.

				PRIEST

		It's only the way we collect that's

Vito has left while Clemenza jokes with the Priest.

the building.

INT. FANUCCI'S HALLWAY - DOWN ANGLE - NIGHT

Fanucci proceeds up the staircase with loud, heavy steps.
An OLD WOMAN on one of the flights sees him, and immediately
moves to her apartment.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		What's the matter, Signora?  You
		don't say 'good evening'?

				WOMAN
			(Sicilian)
		'Good evening,' Signor Fanucci.

She quickly disappears behind her door.  Fanucci laughs,
continues up, singing to himself.  The MASS outside is
always in evidence.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Vito climbs down from the attic, and finds Fanucci's rear
door open.  He slips in, and makes his way past the open
windows, out of which pour the music and chanting of the
Mass.  Slowly and quietly he pulls them down, shut.

He moves quietly to a glass door, and peeks out.

WHAT HE SEES:

Three young women, Fanucci's DAUGHTERS, laughing and talking.

VIEW ON VITO

A slip up.  Tessio had said they were out.  He steps outside
to the alley where he can look into the apartment.

Vito's wife; her baby and several friends and neighbors sit
happily on the front stoop of their tenement.  Some of the
men drink wine poured out of a pitcher; we can still HEAR
the music and night sounds of the Festa.

A neighbor is singing a Neapolitan song.

Quietly, without a word, and with only a momentary glance
from his wife, Vito joins the little group; takes a glass of
wine, and listens to the song.

CLOSE VIEW ON VITO

The room is large, lit from the outside by a bright evening.
We can see the outline of many toys on the shelves built
along the wall.  We see the dark figure of Michael Corleone
enter the room and approach the bed where his son Anthony
lies curled in messy blankets.  Michael quietly arranges his
small hands and feet and covers the little boy.  Suddenly,
Anthony turns, his eyes open.  He is staring, perfectly
awake, at his father.

INT. 'SUPERMAN SHOW' - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

A large room with a succession of platforms arranged step-
like around a circular area which becomes a stage.

There are a hundred or so people, practically all men,
tourists and business men, standing on the different levels,
forming the audience.

In the center of the stage is a thick, telephone type pole,
to which is tied a young Cuban girl, in a flimsy white
sacrificial slip.  A small band, mostly drummers, play some
Latin music.

MED. VIEW

Fredo's party standing on the ramp, looking down at the
spectacle.  They're a little woozy from the drinks and late
hour.  Michael is with them, but now we sense he is using
this time, with all exhausted and drunk, to come to some
important conclusions.

		Everyone stands.  But it's worth

Fredo realizes what he means; looks immediately to Bussetta,
who had been sitting near the door and the musicians.  He is
gone.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - MOVING VIEW ON BUSSETTA - NIGHT

The first time ever away from Michael, moving toward us
quickly.  He stops, knocks on the door of Roth's suite.
Then quickly for a man his size, he moves without noise to
the adjoining door, opens it with a key, and disappears
inside.

A moment elapses on the empty corridor, and then a roused
Johnny Ola, opens the first door.  He steps out into the
corridor, to see who had knocked.  Confused, he is about to
return inside, when Bussetta easily breaks his neck in two
from behind.

INT. THE SUITE - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

as Bussetta quietly pulls the limp body of Johnny Ola, his
head bent at an impossible angle, and lays it at the foot of

Fredo and Michael.  We can see the beautifully dressed
people on their way to the reception, and sense the cheerful
mood of this New Year's Eve.

INT. THE SUITE - NIGHT

Bussetta bends over Ola's body, tying the wrists and knees
with electrical extensions.  He then easily carries the body
to the small balcony which all the rooms have.

playing for the occasion.  A small man has brought a motor
car to pick the family up; and there are certain dark men,
with shotguns slung over their shoulders to preside over the
occasion.

The family is helped into the car; the luggage is packed on

Michael sits at a table having a sparse lunch.  He is
attended by his sister Connie, who seems to be the closest
person now living on the estate with him.  We see from the
way she pampers him with his lunch, that she has fallen into
the role of a surrogate Mother-Wife.  He seems older than
his years, as though his illness, diabetes, has taken its
toll.

				CONNIE

          own Olympics which they originated two million years ago,
          when penguins were nine feet tall and great athletes.
          Archie senses someone staring at him, turns and sees
          Petulia sitting in the grandstand with her parcels. He
          tries to ignore her by concentrating on his kids, but

          He looks back, she is still there, smiling happily.
          Archie gestures for the boys to stay where they are, then

          Oooh la la; Lucky you;
          The group goes off, toward their yacht. Petulia doesn't know
          what to do. David skims off his jeans and jackknifes into
          the water. The sun glints on his exquisite body. Confusedly,
          Petulia pops a segment of an orange into her mouth. David
          surfaces from the water laughing up at her. He looks great.

          97D EXT. YACHT NIGHT

          Petulia and David are returning from the other yacht. They
          are dressed casually, but very well. David is completely
          happy. Petulia is uneasy -- uneasy hell, she's frightened
          out of her wits. From the other yacht we still hear the
          SOUNDS of the Mariache trio and people squealing with delight
          David is humming along with the music.

          PETULIA
          We didn't have to come back this early..

          DAVID
          You're still not one hundred per cent
          well.
          They've reached the cabin. He enters. She waits outside.
          Suddenly his hand is around her wrist, somewhat too hard, and
          in a gesture he hopes is playful, he pulls her down the steps
          into the cabin.

           97E INTO CABIN

           DAVID
           Icy hands.

     All the girls apart from one immediately get to their feet
     and begin to dance to the music, their bodies moving

     girl who refused to stand and yanks her to her feet.

     He slaps her hard and hisses at her in Albanian. She tries
     to sit down again but he pulls her up and slaps her again.
     Finally he shoves her into the middle of the room and she
     begins to dance, sobbing as she does.

     Kirill is in full flow as they walk towards the house.
     The rock music is audible outside the house.

                  So he said to me, `who is this

                  And I said you were the safest guy

                  You know my dad. He didn't say
                  nothing. But his eyes looked

     The door opens and the Albanian opens his arms in welcome.

     and swinging his girl around faster and faster until she
     falls over.

     Nikolai swigs his drink and notices the girl who refused
     to stand up. She is standing in the corner, sobbing.
     Nikolai doesn't care to look at her for more than a second

          you could get maybe 10 times that
          or more. I don't know what to do
          with it. I mean it's yours to do
          with what you want but I'm getting
          a little nervous about it. Never
          thought I'd see enough money to
          make me nervous. We should probably
          talk about the price for
          everything, the clothes, the ads,
          the food and drink for the party,

The same white picket fence with roses in front of it. 

PANNING SLOWLY now away from the roses down to the rich green lawn

He is dressed in khaki trousers, canvas shoes, old white shirt, straw 
hat and dark glasses.

CLOSE - MR. BEAUMONT

watches his watering, then looks up.

The sky and the neighborhood are reflected in his dark glasses.  He 
moves his false teeth around a little in his mouth, jutting out his chin 
in the process.  He's thinking about who knows what.

He looks back down at his lawn.

			in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come
			off a living person. That's direct from the
			Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. 
			There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, 
			but I think there are some people who were 
			brought in for questioning on a murder case 
			that could have something to do with the ear. 
			I heard some of the same names.

					JEFFREY
			Do you know who was brought in for 
			questioning?

					SANDY
			There were at least three, maybe four. But
			a name that keeps coming up is this woman
			who lives in an apartment building very
			close to your house and also close to the 	
			field where you found the ear. There's 
			also a business man over by the Franklin
			factory district that was questioned. and
			a musician. and some others.

					JEFFREY
			Were all these people questioned this
			afternoon?

					SANDY
			No. this has been going on for some time
			. several months. About six months ago
			some parts of bodies were found down by
			the river. They were from people who were
			reported missing. They never found one
			complete body. only parts.

			The ear is from a missing person maybe?

Frank and Dorothy are in the front seat.  Jeffrey is sandwiched between 
two very dirty strange guys in the back.  Frank is driving very fast and 
very crazy.  Sitting next to him on the front seat is a police radio which 
periodically blares out police reports.  At the lights, when they turn 
green, Frank lays rubber.

					FRANK
			Where you wanna go? I know!. We gotta see
			Ben. We gotta, right?

					PAUL

			Yeah. we gotta see Ben. 

The car roars through a seedy street lined with bars and clubs.  Liquor 
and sex shop signs glow in hot neon colors.  They are blurred visions 
because of the speed of Frank's car.

Driving music plays.
Frank careens dangerously down various narrow streets, just barely making
turns.  The Ford bounces off several curbs.  Dorothy occasionally steals 
a glance back at Jeffrey.  She squeals out loud - sometimes with glee, 
mostly in fear.

Raymond and Paul laugh with Frank, yell out or light cigarettes.

Frank finally gets to where he's going - a corner bar - and skids to a

			Okay.

They begin to dance.  At first, further apart, then, they make the mistake
of looking in each other's eyes and they move very close together.  
They move around to another look.  Then they kiss.  They kiss for the 
entire rest of the song.  Between songs and during the entire next song.  
They finally, as they say, come up for air.

					SANDY
			I love you, Jeffrey.

They kiss again.  Then they dance and look at each other.  Then they hug
each other.  As they hug, Jeffrey closes his eyes.

                         I'm not big on music, ordinarily.

               A woman calls sharply from offscreen:

                                     VOICE
                         Ed.

               He looks.

               Silhouetted in the doorway to the party room is Doris, coat 
               over her arm, purse in hand.

               ED'S CAR

               Doris and Ed are driving home.

               Doris draws heavily on a cigarette, looking flintily out at 
               the road.

                                     DORIS
                         ...What a knucklehead.

                                     ED
                         Who?

                         ...Yeah, Freddy Riedenschneider sees 
                         daylight. We got a real shot at this, 
                         folks. Let's not get cocky.

               The door shuts behind him.

               Doris stares down at the table, as at the head of the scene.

               A silent beat; a smile starts to tug at the corners of her 
               mouth.

                                     ED
                         Honey...?

               The smile twitches, and then stays. Doris starts to laugh. 
               Ed frowns.

                                     ED
                         ...Honey?

               Her laughter builds, almost to hysteria. Finally it subsides 
               and, still staring at the tabletop and smiling, she shakes 
               her head:

                                     DORIS
                         What a dope.

               ABUNDAS LIVING ROOM

               Ed sits listening as Birdy plays. She talks, after a moment, 
               her eyes on the sheet music:

                                     BIRDY
                         He was deaf when he wrote this.

                                     ED
                         Who?

                                     BIRDY
                         Beethoven. He created it, and yet he 
                         never actually heard it. I suppose 
                         he heard it all in his head, somehow.

               Over her continued playing:

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         So maybe Riedenschneider could get 
                         Doris off. Maybe it would all work 
                         out. And I thought--I hoped--that 
                         maybe there was a way out for me as 
                         well...

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	A HIGH ANGLE of the CORLEONE MALL in bright daylight.  There
	are at least five hundred guests filling the main courtyard
	and gardens.  There is music and laughing and dancing and
	countless tables covered with food and wine.

	DON CORLEONE stands at the Gate, flanked on either side by a
	son: FREDO and SONNY, all dressed in the formal attire of
	the wedding party.  He warmly shakes the hands, squeezes the
	hands of the friends and guests, pinches the cheeks of the
	children, and makes them all welcome.  They in turn carry
	with them gallons of homemade wine, cartons of freshly baked
	bread and pastries, and enormous trays of Italian delicacies.

	The entire family poses for a family portrait: DON CORLEONE,
	MAMA, SONNY, his wife, SANDRA, and their children, TOM HAGEN
	and his wife, THERESA, and their BABY; CONSTANZIA, the
	bride, and her bridegroom, CARLO RIZZI.  As they move into

	back to the house.  SONNY gives a delicious smile in the
	direction of the Maid-of-Honor, LUCY MANCINI.  She returns
	it.  Then he moves to his wife.

		Accept what's happened, Michael.

				MICHAEL
		I could accept everything that's
		happened; I could accept it, but
		that I never had a choice.  From
		the time I was born, you had laid
		this all out for me.

				DON CORLEONE
		No, I wanted other things for you.

				MICHAEL
		You wanted me to be your son.

				DON CORLEONE
		Yes, but sons who would be
		professors, scientists,
		musicians...and grandchildren who
		could be, who knows, a Governor, a
		President even, nothing's impossible
		here in America.

				MICHAEL
		Then why have I become a man like
		you?

				DON CORLEONE
		You are like me, we refuse to be
		fools, to be puppets dancing on a
		string pulled by other men.  I
		hoped the time for guns and killing
		and massacres was over.  That was
		my misfortune.  That was your
		misfortune.  I was hunted on the
		streets of Corleone when I was
		twelve years old because of who my
		father was.  I had no choice.

				MICHAEL
		A man has to choose what he will be.
		I believe that.

				DON CORLEONE
		What else do you believe in?

	MICHAEL doesn't answer.

                         Perhaps you did not know, Miss 
                         Marianne, that our dear Brandon shares 
                         your passion for music and plays the 
                         piano forte very well.

               MARIANNE looks at BRANDON in some surprise.

                         melancholy tunes as Miss Marianne!

               Her tone is so knowing that MARIANNE frowns uncomfortably.

                                     MRS JENNINGS
                         Come! Let us see you both side by

    INT./ EXT.  MACE'S LIMO AND STREET - DAY

    Mace and Lenny drive through the streets of LA on the last
    day of this millennium.  There are cops in body armor and
    helmets on some street corners, holding automatic rifles.
    Helicopters orbit endlessly.  And a National Guard tank
    rumbles down the street.  State of siege.  The car radio
    is on, with KROQ's poor Man hyping the impending
    Millennium LA party.

                             POOR MAN
              ... the New Years Eve mega-bash of
              the century.  Ten square blocks of
              madness, with live music, fireworks
              and the actual rich and famous of LA
              hobnobbing with us peons.  Also
              yours truly the Poor Man will be
              there at the KROQ bandshell, giving
              away "Millennium LA" and "KROQ 2-K"
              T-shirts by the truckload--

    Lenny is keyed up and tense.  He keeps looking out the
    back window.

              Will you relax.  There's nobody back

              Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my

              Relaxing might be right out, okay?!

    INT.  CECILE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

    Lenny is in a chair in the kitchen, listening to Max on
    the cellular.  He is holding a dish-towel full of ice
    cubes on his scalp.  It is soaked with blood and his
    Armani jacket and silk shirt are spattered.  Mace lifts
    the ice pack to check that the bleeding has stopped.

                             MACE
              You are a pussy-whipped sorry-ass

open, and Elizabeth (in her 60's) enters. She is
wearing a large sparkling pearl-encrusted dress with a
wide collar.

She walks slowly and carefully, and has a slight tremor
in her head and hands. She seems un-certain; like
she's not sure she recognizes all the faces around her
(Alzheimer's?). And she compensates for it by being
all the more regal, all the more un-human.

Essex is on her arm, dressed in a splendid jewel-
encrusted doublet.

Robert Cecil FROWNS at the sight of Essex on her arm.

Essex ignores Cecil's glare, notices Southampton--

                 (to Elizabeth)
          Ah-- Majesty, I've been told my lord

Robert Cecil, on the other hand, looks horrified.

     SETH walks out and PETER puts on his headphones, the MUSIC
     kicks in again. He picks up the portable hard drive, looks
     around and sees no one, then inserts it into his computer. He
     has four large screens in front of him and as he begins
     opening window upon window of mathematical models his face
     begins to soften and he gets into his comfort zone. The frame
     is filled with the extremely complex programs and numbers
     flying by.

The guy goes inside his apartment.

                    RIGGAN
          One more time...

Now, from the door of the rooftop, a good neighbor calmly
approaches Riggan.

                    GOOD NEIGHBOR
          Hi, sir. Can I help you? You should be
          careful.

          Sorry. Can't talk. I'm late.

          Music.

Some underscoring music begins to sound. The neighbor is now
close to him and helps Riggan step down from the edge on to the
floor of the rooftop.

                    GOOD NEIGHBOR
          Are you alright? Do you want me to
          call someone? Do you know where to go?

Riggan closes his eyes for a moment as the camera moves slowly
toward him. He opens his eyes. The music begins to swell. Riggan
stands up straight and proud, and in a voice that sounds like
Birdman...

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT

     The room is dark.  Erin enters and flops down onto the bed,
     exhausted.  George is lying on the bed next to her.

     Dry, flat California.  Ed's big old Mercedes is toodling down

     INT. ED'S MERCEDES - DAY

     Frank Sinatra is playing on the stereo.  Ed is swaying in
     time.  This is his kind of music.  He smiles, looks at Erin.

                               ED
            It's Sinatra's world, we just live in it.

     Whatever.  Erin glances at the speedometer.  Oy.  So slow.
     His car phone rings.  He picks it up.

                               ED
            Hello? ...

            Hi, babys.  Baby's fine.  Yes, I did.  I
            did, too, you just didn't feel it.

     He starts swerving across the lane markers.  THWACK THWACK
     THWACK.  Ed doesn't notice.  Erin's getting nervous.

                               ED
            You think I could leave without kissing my
            babys?  Okay, here you go.

     He kisses into the phone.  Swerves.  A car barely misses
     them.  Erin's eyes widen.  Not fun at all.

                               ED
            Bye-bye ... bye-bye ... no, you.  Okay,

     Erin and Ed amble down the porch, checking door numbers, each
     rattling a key.  They find their adjacent rooms and stop.
     Erin leans against the wall, too weak to stand.

                               ED
            Lock the door every which way you can.  And
            if there's anything -- funny sound, whatever
            -- pound on the wall.  I'll come right over.

     She nods a little.  Then before she goes into her room:

                               ERIN
            I think you should know -- there's very few

                        (beat)
            You're one of 'em.

     It's as tender as she gets, and he's moved by it.  They look
     at each other.  Maybe even considering.  But after a long
     beat, she reaches for her door again.  Moment over.

                               ED
            I'm triple locking my door, so don't even
            think of trying to take advantage.

     She smiles, goes inside.  He watches her close her door
     behind her before going inside himself.

all well-intentioned though, as     the two share a laugh after

          It was beautiful, wasn't it?

Samantha shrugs.

                      DAD (CONT'D)
          Sam lost her mind! She's a huge
          Astros fan.

                           SAMANTHA
          Sure.

INT. MUSIC ROOM - LATER

Dad plays the piano and sings, while Jimmy plays guitar.
The kids sit at the kitchen table, listening intently.
                                                       54.

                      DAD
          "Well Saturday night was a lunar
          eclipse, I sang 'em a song, went
          somethin' like this: Well go to sleep,
          my weary babies, Let the sounds roll
          on by, Tonight we're safe here in
          Houston, With this, your daddy's
          lullaby. Your mother's got a new
          husband now, He seems alright, I
          wonder if he's readin' them stories,
          And kissin' them goodnight? Well
          babysitters say they miss me, I know
          I shouldn't hope it's true, The
          teacher says my son paints pictures
          of a family all in blue, She says
          she caught him whispering to the
          window, Will Daddy please come home?
          I know I could call him up, but what
          if his mother answers the phone?

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Samantha is lying in her bed, listening to her iPod.

                      DAD
          You brush your teeth?

She removes her ear buds.

          Yeah.

                      DAD
          Well, if you gotta move, you gotta
          move, you know? It's no big deal.
          We can handle that. I'll still come
          get you every other weekend. I mean,
          unless she moves 500 miles away or
          something, it'll just be a little
          more car time. No big deal.

                      MASON
          I'm just kinda sick of moving.

                      DAD
          Well, I bet you are. But you know,
          you never know. I mean, I might
          have to move, right? I'm working
          for this insurance company now.
          These places get bought and sold all
          the time. You know? We'll just
          roll with it.

They take off pants, walk up to the water in boxer shorts.

                      MASON
          I thought you were a musician?

                      DAD
          I am but... life is expensive, you
          know. Guy's got to be responsible.
          What do you think?

Mason pushes his Dad into the water, then dives in himself.

          Hey, hey, you bast -- Oh you, punk

Mason opens the door as he and his mother enter the house.

                        MOM

Mom drops her purse on the table and then walks down the
hallway to Samantha's bedroom. She knocks on the door before
walking inside.

The College Girl is now playing guitar and singing "Wish You

A station wagon pulls up in front of Mason's house. The
teenagers inside are listening to music, about to drop Mason
off at home.

Mason is in the far back of the station wagon, making out
with a BLONDE GIRL.

           Hey, Mason.
               (hands Mason a joint)
           One last hit.

Mason takes a hit of the joint.

           Hey! Mickey Mouse Club. Get the
           fuck out of my car. Just crawl out
           the back window or something, man.

Mason climbs out the back window of the station wagon.

          Look, you can sit there like there's
          a death in the family, alright, but
          bottom line is that was my car.
          Alright? I paid for it, I took care
          of it, and I can do whatever I want
          with it. Alright? I'm sorry if you
          had other ideas about it but when
          you get older you can save up and
          buy a car of your own. And be cool
          like I used to be. Or... you can
          get a mini-van.

Annie and Samantha watch a Lady Gaga music video on Samantha's

Annie Laughs.

                      DAD (CONT'D)
          You know, whenever you listen to too
          much of the solo stuff, it kind of
          becomes a drag, you know? But you
          put 'em next to each other, alright,
          and they start to elevate each
          other... and then you can hear it.
          Huh! It's The Beatles. You know?

                      MASON
          I don't know. I think I always just
          liked Paul the best.

                      DAD
          It doesn't matter, you know, you're
          missing the point. There is no
          favorite Beatle! That's what I'm
          saying. It's in the balance. That's
          what made them the greatest fucking
          rock band in the world. Okay? You
          know, and there's this decade of
          music out there that's been scattered.

24   EXT. "HOPE HOUSE" - OKLAHOMA CITY - NIGHT                         24

     A three-story Victorian residence in decay, next door to a
     CHURCH/SOUP KITCHEN in the middle of Oklahoma City's Skid Row.
     Rain falls. The street is still.

     Mackelway approaches this halfway-house. A few lights shine
     within, and the blue glow of a tv. Upstairs can be heard the
     strident, off-key voice of somebody singing.

25   EXT./INT. HOPE HOUSE - DOORWAY - CONTINUING                       25

     The front door is open. Through a SCREEN DOOR, Mackelway can
     see an old-fashioned "foyer." He knocks. Waits.

     Two sounds dominate: the buzz from that tv, and the strident
     singing, which we realize is an a capela version of "La Vida
     Loca" audible through an open bedroom window.

     But no one's coming to answer the door, and it's wide open
     anyway... So Mackelway enters.

                          MACKELWAY
                Hello?

26   INT. HOPE HOUSE - ENTRY - CONTINUING                              26

     TV room is to his left. There, a single 35 year-old DRUNK/
     TRANSIENT (we'll call him "PIPER") sits, watching "Behind the
     Music" on VH1. Tonight's subject? Leif Garret...

     Piper doesn't look up, or acknowledge Mackelway at all. Rather
     he INCREASES THE TV VOLUME to drown out the singing upstairs,
     which seems to be intentionally off-key.

     Torn couches, stained carpet, cracked window. Posters and
     fliers on the walls. 10 BEDROOMS upstairs.

                          DYSON (O.S.)
                Agent Mackelway?

     Mackelway turns. Descending a creaking stairway is DAVID
     DYSON: 50, lean, with a friendly smile.

                                                      CUT TO:

                I can't anymore.

     Mackelway eyes her, then reaches past her, and turns the
     VOLUME on that boom-box back UP. The chanting fills the room
     again.

     And just like that, he has pulled her back onto him, urgently.
     That primal side hasn't been sated yet...

     Mackelway stands at the mirror, changing the dressing on that
     wound across his chest. He unwraps the gauze over that fat
     bandage soaked through with blood.

     He pulls the bandage off, giving us a better look at the deep
     gash. Dried blood, torn skin, bruising. Looks like hell. But
     Mackelway eyes it calmly.

     He slugs down some beer from a nearby bottle, then cleans the
     wound with some Hydrogen Peroxide... as Katie appears in the
     doorway. She eyes him.

                          KATIE
                Can't sleep?

     He shrugs, turns.

                What was that music?

                It's Navajo. A song for dead warriors. I

     and she wears a fuzzy angora sweater.

                             ED (as GLEN)
               "My mind's in a muddle.  I thought
               I could stop wearing these things.
               I tried, honestly I tried..."

                             DOLORES (as BARBARA)
                       (tentative)
               "Glen, I don't fully understand this.
               But maybe together -- we can work it
               out."

     She stands up, dramatically takes off her angora sweater, and
     gives it to Ed.

     He holds it meaningfully, then smiles proudly.

                             ED
               Music swells... and CUT and PRINT IT!

     Ed and Dolores hug.

     INT. EDITING ROOM - DAY

     On a MOVIOLA, we see the black-and-white image of Dolores
     taking off her angora and giving it to Ed.

     WE PULL OUT.  Ed and Georgie are hunched over, watching the
     movie.  Ed smiles proudly.

                             ED
               And we fade out.  "The End."
                       (the film runs out)
               What do you think?

     Georgie peers at his watch.  He shakes his bead.

                             GEORGIE
               I think it's fifty-seven minutes
               long.

               And you did a bang-up job, too.  But
               you don't want other producers to
               know that's you in drag.  Trust me.
               It's a career killer.

     Ed is quite upset.

                             ED
               But I'm proud.  I wrote, directed,
               and starred in it just like Orson
               Welles in "Citizen Kane"!

                             GEORGIE
               Yeah??  Well Orson Welles didn't
               wear angora sweaters, did he??!

     Ed is beaten.

     It's the cast and crew screening!  The eager two-dozen people
     are packed into a tiny screening room.

     The lights dim, and the movie starts.  A LIBRARY MUSIC fanfare,
     and then: "Bela Lugosi in GLEN OR GLENDA"

     Everyone APPLAUDS excitedly.  Bela smiles.
       
     Credits continue: "Featuring Daniel Davis and Dolores Fuller"

     The audience is audibly baffled.  Bunny BLURTS out.

                             BUNNY

     <u>stampeding</u>.  Bela's angry face is superimposed over this.

     People are impressed by this technique.  Bela nods in approval.

     ON-SCREEN

     Out of nowhere, CHEAP JAZZ MUSIC starts, and the movie abruptly
     cuts to SLEAZY STAG PARTY-STYLE FOOTAGE!  A bare-chested man

     stick!  A brunette violently rips off her dress and does a
     hoochie-coochie dance!

     The crowd is stunned.

     Ed looks back at Georgie, who's wearing a big satisfied grin.

     INT. PARTY - LATER THAT NIGHT

     Everybody is CELEBRATING, with a raucous party.  People are
     boozing it up.  BIG BAND MUSIC plays.  Ed dances with Dolores.
     Paul smokes a joint.  Conrad falls over a table and breaks a
     lamp.  Bela dances happily with a cute young REDHEAD.

                             BELA

               Ed, it was superb.

               A great show!  A little strange...
               but great -- especially my scenes.

                             ED
               Just like I always promised.  Now
               you're among the immortals.  You're

     It's an incredible performance of crowning tragedy.  Bela is
     totally drained.

     CU - ED

     He is very moved.  He whispers, barely audible.

                             ED
               Cut.  It's a wrap.

     The wrap party is being thrown in the meat packing plant.
     People laugh and shout and carry on.  Tor pours booze in the
     punch.  R&amp;B MUSIC plays.  Old Man McCoy dances with Loretta.
     Bunny dances with a young stud.  Dolores stands by herself.

     Bela and Criswell are giggling.

     Across the room, Paul and Conrad chat.

                             PAUL MARCO
               "Glen Or Glenda," now that was a hell
               of a picture.

                             CONRAD
               Well, this new one's gonna be a
               hundred times better.

                             PAUL MARCO
               Is that possible?

     Dolores overhears this.  She stares in disbelief.

     AT THE TURNTABLE

     Someone changes the record.  Brassy STRIPPER MUSIC begins.

     A door opens, and Ed struts out, in full gaudy drag.

     Everybody turns.  They start WHISTLING and HOLLARING.

     Ed grins, and starts into a wacky bump-and-grind.

                             VOICE
               Go, baby, go!

     Bunny runs up and sticks a dollar bill between Ed's fake tits.
     People LAUGH hysterically.

     Dolores is appalled.

     Ed shimmies to the music, blowing kisses all around.  He sees
     Vampira and waves.

     Vampira's jaw drops in recognition.

                             VAMPIRA
               I don't believe it.  It's <u>him</u>!

     Ed sashays up to Bela and dances a few steps with him.  The
     music is building to a climax.  Ed hurries off to center stage
     -- and as the MUSIC ENDS, he does a final swing of his hips,
     then suddenly yanks out his teeth!

     This brings down the house.  Everyone STAMPS their feet and
     CLAPS crazily.

     ANGLE - DOLORES

     Everyone, except Dolores.  Suddenly, she explodes.

                             DOLORES
               You people are INSANE!  Take a look
               around -- you're all FREAKS!

     The room quiets.  Dolores has snapped.

               I dunno.  Ed was real mysterious.
               All he'd say was it's a surprise
               party.

                             CRISWELL

               And isn't that like <u>us</u> -- that we
               show up anyway.

     They pull up to a GUARD GATE.  They're at a studio.

     INSIDE

     It's PANDEMONIUM.  People are screaming and shouting.  Kids jump
     up and down, on top of the chairs.

     Bela, Tor, Vaspira, and Criswell are alarmed.

     The lights dim on and off.  Scratchy SPOOKY MUSIC blasts over
     the sound system.

                             ED
               Wow.  Go knock 'em dead!

     Criswell pushes blind Tor towards the stage.  Tor sticks out
     his arms and scarily staggers down the aisle.  Criswell
     nervously follows.  Vampira escorts Bela.

     The crowd BOOS.  They pelt our gang with popcorn.

     Tor GROWLS like a monster.  Kids LAUGH and jeer.

     ON ED AND KATHY

     In back, Ed speaks in a frightening manner into a MICROPHONE:

                             ED (amplified)
               Ooooo!  At the stroke of midnight,
               the witching hour, the ghouls arise
               from the <u>dead</u>!

     DOWN THE AISLE

     Tor slips in some butter.  He tumbles and falls.

     A WOMAN'S VOICE cackles.

                             WOMAN'S VOICE
               It's the blind leading the blind!

     Tor staggers to his feet.  All disoriented, he starts walking
     the wrong direction and falls over a chair.  People HECKLE.

     Criswell quickly helps his up.

In comparison to the darkness of the hooch, a highly lit

disordered hooch, loud and finger-snapping COUNTRY WESTERN MUSIC 
playing from a tape deck, a well-known tune, circa 1967.

BUNNY, the 18 year-old angel face, totters drunk with a Colt-45 
beer in hand, over to JUNIOR, the badass black kid with the zits,

disordered hooch, loud and finger-snapping COUNTRY WESTERN MUSIC 
playing from a tape deck, a well-known tune, circa 1967.

BUNNY, the 18 year-old angel face, totters drunk with a Colt-45 
beer in hand, over to JUNIOR, the badass black kid with the zits, 
who just lies there on his cot sweating, doing nothing.

			BUNNY
		(listening to the music)
	Listen to that shit, that's good shit!

			JUNIOR
		(irritated as always)
	Fuck that redneck noise, dude.  All dem chicks be

EXT. PERIMETER #3 - DAY

Rhah, at the edge of the treeline, vigorously shakes his walking 
stick at him, his other hand a fist, waving them, emitting his 
cry.

			RHAH
	Baaaaaaaaa!!!!!!

Defiance.  Pride.  Dig me, I'm Rhah - and there isn't nobody like 
me in the world.

EXT/INT: PERIMETER #3 - LZ CHOPPER - DAY

The chopper - with its huge red cross painted on - now rising to 
meet God.  Smashed on morphine, Chris looking out at the waving 
ants below.

Now the trees, the skyline and the chopper is moving fast over 
the devestation.  The jungle forever locked in his memory, Chris 
looks back, copious, quiet tears flowing from his eyes.

			CHRIS (V.O.)
	I think now, looking back, we did not fight the 
	enemy, we fought ourselves - and the enemy was in us 
	... The war is over for me now, but it will always be 
	there - the rest of my days.  As I am sure Elias will 
	be - fighting with Barnes for what Rhah called 
	possession of my soul ... There are times since I 
	have felt like the child born of those two fathers 
	... but be that as it may, those of us who did make 
	it have an obligation to build again, to teach to 
	others what we know and to try with what's left of 
	our lives to find a goodness and meaning to this life 
	...

The music surges now to its full strength as we replay bits of 
film with each actor's name listed - some with silly, clowning 
looks, others sober, haunted.  Gardner, Tex, King, Rhah, Lerner, 
Sanderson, Manny, Big Harold - all the boys ... and then Barnes 
staring quietly into the camera, and lastly Elias - shirt off, 
bowl of grass in hand, his big, beautiful smile.

     Rebecca and Marc drive around singing along to their favorite
     song, high, having the best time of their lives. When the
     song ends, they play it again...and again.

     They take bumps and keep going.

               little initiative. When I was

          the music I want to use, I can tell

          Ahh, mon Dieu! Guido? Guido Contini?
          What are you doing here at the Folies
          Bergere? You naughty boy! You're
          only nine years old! But I'm glad
          you've come. Would you like to join
          me on stage? Yes. Come. Come, come,
          come.

And she brings him onto the stage. The audience
applauds. She addresses him as though he is Older
Guido.

                       LILLI (CONT'D)
          Feeling better? There's no room for
          hopelessness in here, is there, Guido?
                 (to the audience)
          We must explain something to our young
          Guido. What do we want? Laughter!
          What do we want? Love! What do we
          want? Dreams! Let us not forget,
          Guido, mon cher -- That's our
          privilege - to entertain.

The number kicks into full gear with a rousing can-can.
Young Guido finds himself swept into Lilli's
intoxicating world.

INT. GUIDO'S SUITE - NIGHT

We seem to be looking at the SET ON STAGE 5. But
suddenly a HUGE HEAD dips into the shot and it's Guido
contemplating a model of the set. He places a figure
on the top of the staircase.
                                     p. 41


He moves round to the front of the model and places
another figure on the top of the scaffold tower. He
knocks it over.

Unconvinced, he sits down on the sofa. The coffee
table is covered in head-shots. He finds the one of
Claudia.   Guido looks at it.

He lies back to write and finds himself in CLAUDIA'S
LAP. She hands him a lipstick, smiles and strokes his
hair. He starts to sign - "TO HIS EXCELLENCY.... "
then paints his lips and kisses the photo himself.
Claudia laughs.


INT. ANCIENT BATHS - DAY

Grottos and tunnels are thick with steam.    Guido
follows the Cardinal's Secretary.

EXT. PIAZZA WITH FOUNTAIN - NIGHT

Claudia leaves behind the hat on the fountain and moves
closer to Guido. The music continues.

          Maybe you should have knocked, maybe
          you should have knocked me right off
          the pedestal. I can't do this
          anymore.

She takes off her wig and diamond earrings.

                        CLAUDIA (CONT'D)
          This is me.   And you have a wife who

She hands him the wig and the earrings.    She kisses
him.

          I'll miss you. Wrong girl.

	Yeah, that's it.  Say it slow.

Jetson pronounces the words and Sykes follows along
haltingly.  After several tries, he can say it passably
well.


INT.  ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT

An upscale, mostly yuppie-human dance club.  The
antithesis of the "X" bar.  A human HOSTESS in a slit
dress has just finished seating Sykes and Jetson at a
table.  She moves off.  The two cops look up at the stage.

REVERSE ANGLE

revealing the exotic alien dancer named CASSANDRA.  She
moves with a feline blend of strength and grace.  Framing
her face is a silvery nylon wig that she tosses like a
mane as she undulates to the MUSIC.

Sykes watches with fascination.  The MUSIC ends and
Cassandra steps down from the stage, to be replaced by a
human DANCER as the next SONG cranks up.  Sykes and Jetson
quickly intercept her as she heads backstage.

			JETSON
	You are Cassandra?

			CASSANDRA
	That's right.

			JETSON
	We are with the Police Department.
	This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--

       Greer paces anxiously -- when suddenly his Nextel RINGS.     He
       answers it, though it's hard to hear over the music.

               bare, signs of disrepair are beginning to weather the house.

           A pleasure to meet you, though I
           fear we shan't be acquainted for
           too long.

                          BOB
           Excuse me?

                          PAMELA
           These books simply do not lend
           themselves to chirping and
           prancing. No. Certainly not a
           musical. Now, where is Mister
           Disney? I'd very much like to get
           this started and finished as
           briskly as is humanly possible.

           Don?

                          DON
           Uh-- erm. Ha! We had planned a

          down her skirt and opens the script.

Benny lets him in.

Jean enters a rundown railroad flat crammed with musical
instruments, beer cans, and homemade art. There's a couch with a
sheet over it.

Junk is piled in a corner - mostly art books and drawings.

Benny sits down at an electric piano, which he's evidently
playing. He sings along, softly, working out the words,
concentrating, absorbed.

Jean sets his belongings on the couch, walks to a mic stand and
starts making up his own words.

Benny turns off the piano and lights a roach, angry at Jean's
self-centeredness.

Jean digs through a pile of garbage. Finally, he finds what he's
looking for - a pile of "SAMO baseball cards" - color Xeroxes of
his favorite images and words. He pockets them.

           RKKKK! That's a beautiful name... French?

Jean sits in a chair onstage with his band members. Benny plays
the organ. The other band members play percussion and guitar.

It works. The crowd loves it.

The song ends abruptly.

We begin to hear James Brown's "Sex Machine."

Jean looks out into the crowd and notices Gina. She's looking
right back at him from the bar. Pleased to see her face, he says
to himself -

A cockroach crawls from Gina's bedroom across the floor and into
the kitchen where Jean sits naked on the floor, working on a
drawing. It crawls over his drawing towards a cardboard box.

Jean rummages through a cabinet. He finds a can of bugspray. Jean
tears off a side of the box. With cardboard in one hand and
bugspray in the other, he forgets the cockroach.

He's mesmerized by the list of ingredients on the aerosol can.

Someone POUNDS furiously at the door.

Ignoring the pounding, he starts listing the ingredients on the
piece of cardboard, finishing his new drawing by including a
symbol of a cockroach to the left of the list.

                      LANDLADY
           Miss Cardinale... Open up for me, please!

He gets up and peeks through the security hole. He sees a middle-
aged Hispanic woman reaching to unlock the door. He opens it.

                      LANDLADY (CONT'D)
           Ohhh, Dios mio!

She stares at him levelly.

                      LANDLADY (CONT'D)
           I just want the rent.

           Oh - you mean black people!

He shoots and misses again. He throws it to Benny, who does a
picture-perfect lay-up.

           really famous?

During the following, Benny performs a series of amazing shots
while Jean looks on admiringly.

                      BENNY
           For a musician or a painter?

Jean shrugs.

                      BASQUIAT
           Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your
           stuff all day without thinking about
           anything else.

                      BENNY
           Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich.

He shoots. Swish.

                      BENNY (CONT'D)
           First, you have to dress right.

He shoots again. Swish.

                       GINA
           I'm going to my parents this weekend. What
           am I going to wear?
                  (she begins to cry)
           How could you do that to me?

Jean wipes his hands off on his thighs and puts his arms around
Gina, holding her.

                      BASQUIAT
           ... I'll buy you some new ones.

                      GINA

           You don't have any fucking money..

Jean lets her cry for a moment, then notices the music playing on
the stereo - a Gypsy song sung in Spanish.

                      BASQUIAT
           Do you know what he's saying?

           ... if one day I die, and    you read this
           piece of paper, I want you    to know how much
           I love you. Although I'll    never see you
           again, Gypsy, Gypsy, your    hair, your hair,

Gina looks up at him.

           'Even though you were never mine
           And you never will be
           You have a piece of my heart
           You have, you have, you have...'
                  (he reaches down, wiping off
                  Gina's face)
           'Gypsy, Gypsy, your hair, your hair, your
           face, your face.'

No longer crying, Gina leans her head against Jean.

We HEAR a CALL from the window:

"BOOM #2
A CAT POURING TACKS ON ITS TONGUE"

SOMEONE (the big red-haired dealer we met earlier) walks in front
of us.

CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a crowd in a gallery. It is literally
filled with people. Again - all this takes place in silence.

We begin to HEAR Peggy Lee's "Is That All There Is?" It colors
the motion of the crowd.

                                                  CUT TO:


EXT. PRINCE ST (BET. MERCER AND WOOSTER) - DUSK

Jean walks down the street. He's got on a new set of clothes and
he listens to a Walkman. We HEAR Miles Davis' "Flamenco
Sketches."


JEAN'S POV

We MOVE down Prince St. and take a left on West Broadway. We
approach a huge crowd. We get closer and closer until we are
immersed in it.

The crowd realizes Jean's amongst them. People start approaching
him. Someone removes the headphones.

The DIN of the crowd replaces the music. Amongst the normal crowd
chatter, we hear friends' calling out:

             Jean!!! Jean Michel!!!

INT. ANNINA NOSEI GALLERY

Annina    beckons to him. Beyond her, he sees Albert, Andy, and
Bruno.    He's being escorted or maybe just pushed - it's hard to
tell.    Each step of the way, he's pounced upon by INDIVIDUALS
we've    never met. The room is wall-to-wall with people. People are
swept    along in currents.

                          MAN
                     (wildly enthusiastic)

                      ANDY WARHOL
           I can't even see what's good anymore.

Jean Michel obliterates the rest of the logo with some white.

Andy steps back and squints as he examines Jean's work.

                      ANDY WARHOL (CONT'D)
           Yeah, I see what you mean about the white.
           It's better.

Jean quits painting.

                      BASQUIAT
           After the show we should take a nice long
           vacation. Maybe go to Hawaii. That's what

           I'm gonna do. I'm going to give up painting
           and start playing music again. I wanna
           sing.

                      ANDY WARHOL
           That would be a pity because you're a real
           painter.

Frank arrives.

                      FRANK
           Here's the poster for the show.

He presents them with a yellow poster of Jean and Andy facing
each other with boxing gloves.

Andy opens the box. Inside is a football helmet with Jean's

            It's placid, imperturbable, prosaic. But
            my mind rebels against stagnation. It's
            like a racing engine, tearing itself to
            pieces because it's not connected up with
            the work for which it was built.

He has tucked the violin under his chin, starts to
improvise a nervous pent-up melody. There is nothing
amateurish about it -- he plays quite well.

Watson resumes working on his manuscript. Suddenly the
music stops. Watson looks up apprehensively. Holmes has
put down the violin, and is crossing to the sideboard.
He opens Watson's medical bag, takes out a bottle of
cocaine, starts toward his bedroom. Watson pushes the
writing arm to the side, rises from his chair.

Holmes   pays no   attention, continues into the bedroom.
Watson   crosses   to the open door. Inside the bedroom,
Holmes   has put   down the cocaine bottle on the washstand,
and is   rolling   up his left sleeve.

                         WATSON
            Holmes, where is your self-control?

            Fair question.

From a drawer he takes a morocco case, opens it, removes
a hypodermic syringe.

Before Holmes can answer, the door opens and Watson
sticks his head in. He is flushed and slightly
inebriated, and there is a flower tucked behind his ear.
From off comes the SOUND of wild balalaika music.

                       WATSON
          Excuse me.

an idea forming in his mind.

the door.

The party has built into a real wingding by now. It's

the ballerinas to madly accelerating balalaika music.
Flower behind ear, hair mussed, tie undone, short of
breath -- he is in paradise.

Holmes makes his way through the revelers, approaches
Watson.

There is a cheery fire burning in the grate. Holmes is
stretched out full-length on the couch, playing a set of
Corelli variations on his violin. Watson is in his usual
chair, reading the Evening Standard.

                       WATSON'S VOICE
          What, indeed, was his attitude toward
          women? Was there some secret he was
          holding back -- or was he just a thinking
          machine, incapable of any emotion?


EXT. BAKER STREET - NIGHT

Wisps of fog swirl along the street, making yellow haloes
around street lamps.

                       WATSON'S VOICE
          I was not to get the answer until we
          became involved in what I consider to be
          the most outrageous case in all our years
          together.

Out of the mist comes a hansom cab, with the dim figure
of a woman visible in the passenger seat. The cab stops
in front of 221B, and the driver starts to get down.
From upstairs comes the faint sound of violin music.

Watson steps up to the window, pulls the curtain aside,
looks down toward the street.

The cabbie crosses the pavement, consults an address in
his hand, glances up at the number of the house, then
rings the bell.

She is wearing and wedding ring and her name, we will
subsequently learn, is GABRIELLE.

          That's all she keeps saying -- I don't

The violin music stops o.s.   Watson has now reached the
foot of the stairs.

          Where did she come from?

                       CABBIE
          From the river. I was driving down the
          Embankment, just below Westminster
          Bridge, and there she was in the water --
          drowning.

Holmes appears on the landing above, violin and bow in
his hand.

                 (trying to hide his

          Oh... Well, I just thought it was the
          kind of case that might interest him. I
          dare say we can solve it without his

From Holmes' bedroom comes the sound of a melancholy tune
being played on the violin. Watson starts to ease
Lestrade out of the door.

                       WATSON
          Good day, Lestrade.

He shuts the door after him, listens to the sound of the
violin for a moment. Then he crosses to the wicker
chair, seats himself. He takes some sheets of paper out
of the rack and places them on the writing arm, dips his
pen in the inkwell, starts to write.

The violin music continues OVER SCENE, infinitely
romantic, infinitely sad.

     INT. ELEVATOR OPENING OUT INTO LOBBY. EARLY EVENING.

     Fran, Ripley, Mr and Mrs Greenleaf and others emerge from an
     elevator. Emily talks to Fran, Herbert to Ripley.

                         EMILY GREENLEAF
                   (to Fran)
               I hope you'll come and see us...

               That's very kind.

               Both of you...

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Of course, Dickie's idea of music is
               Jazz. He has a saxophone.  To my ear Jazz
               is just noise, just an insolent noise.

     EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST. EARLY EVENING.

     Ripley shakes hands with Herbert Greenleaf as he gets into
     his Rolls Royce. They are making an appointment. Ripley
     crosses the street to Fran, pecks her cheek. She hands him
     his share of their fee.

                         RIPLEY
               Gotta run. I'm so late.

     From another vantage point Ripley hurries on as Fran gets
     into her boyfriend's car. A piano quartet starts up.

     EXT. THEATER. EVENING.

     Ripley runs past the droves of arriving concert-goers and
     heads for the theater. Music continues.

     INT. MEN'S ROOM, THEATER. NIGHT.

     The interval: A thick mass of men in tuxedoes grooming
     themselves at the basins. Ripley turns on faucets, offers
     towels, brushes off dandruff. Men talk over, round, and
     through him.  Put coins in a bowl.

     INT. A BOX AT THE THEATER. NIGHT

     The concert continues. Ripley peers through the curtain at
     the performances.  A haughty woman in the box turns round and
     he closes the curtain.

     INT. BACKSTAGE. 1:30 A.M.

     An empty auditorium. Ripley plays Bach in the blue

     apologetically.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, NEW YORK. DAY.

     A vinyl RECORD revolves in close up.  An exuberant and
     mysterious VOICE is scat singing. Wild. Then the sound slides
     into a raucous big band jazz number:  Dizzy Gillespie's <i>The
     Champ</i>. A HAND ejects the record. When the camera finds the
     man's face it is BLINDFOLDED. He's hot. He's wearing an
     undershirt. He's trying to identify the recording.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               I don't know. Count Basie?  Duke
               Ellington. I don't know. Count Basie.

     The man pulls of the blindfold, examines the record cover of
     the disc he's been trying to learn, needs to put on glasses
     to do so, is irritated by his mistake. He ejects the record.

     A pile of other jazz records are strewn across a cluttered
     table which includes classical sheet music and a paper
     keyboard. One hand idly mimes at the keys.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

     Another song for Ripley to identify is on the gramophone.
     Chet Baker's <i>My Funny Valentine</i>.  Signs everywhere of
     packing. A suitcase. Books about Italy.  Ripley paces in this
     BASEMENT room, which is bathroom, kitchen, living room and
     bedroom all in one.  Tiny, tidy, squalid and sad. The windows
     give onto bars and a wall.

                         RIPLEY
               Don't even know if this is a man or a
               woman.

     There's a violent row going on in the room above his head. He
     flinches.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

     Ripley, shining his shoes, packing almost done, is testing
     himself on another piece of music. Free jazz saxophone:
     Charlie Parker's <i>Koko</i>.  He listens hard, recognizes the
     track.

               But the point is Dickie - well we know
               this - Dickie loves Marge and he misses
               her and apparently he's come to his
               senses...

                         RIPLEY
               It's fantastic.
                   (to Peter)
               I feel guilty. Marge doesn't understand
               this, but anytime Dickie does something I
               feel guilty.

     INT. APARTMENT, PALAZZA GIOIA. DAY.

     Ripley is being shown an APARTMENT FOR RENT in the Palazzo
     Gioia by a dry-witted older woman, SIGNORA BUFFI. Ripley
     explores, relishing the decor.

                         SIGNORA BUFFI
               Accendo il riscaldamento.

               <i>(I'm deaf. The couple below are deaf. So,
               do you like it?)</i>

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. AFTERNOON.

     Ripley is in the apartment, fire burning, wearing pyjamas.
     There's a small Christmas tree. He kneels on the floor with
     some festive, gift-wrapped packages. He opens a package. It's
     a marble head of Hadrian. A gasp from Ripley. He picks up a
     glass, pours himself a drink.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. LATE AFTERNOON.

     Ripley plunges into Bach's Italian Concerto on his new and
     precious toy, a STEINWAY GRAND. His doorbell rings. He stops
     playing. He doesn't get visitors. He rises, a little nervous.

                         RIPLEY
               Hello?

Title: Talented Mr. Ripley, The
Genres:

                         FREDDIE
               Because he's been hiding from me - what
               happened at Christmas?

                         RIPLEY
               What about Christmas?

                         FREDDIE
               He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't
               get a cable or a call or a note or,
               frankly, a fart.

     Ripley has his hands behind his back. HE'S TUGGING
     FRANTICALLY AT DICKIE'S RINGS. Ripley wanders into the
     kitchen, turns on the tap to sluice his fingers.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               Of course, he's been very involved in his
               music, hasn't he? I think his theory is,
               you know, you have to go into a cocoon
               before you can become a butterfly.

                         FREDDIE
               Which is horseshit.  Have you heard him
               play that thing?
                   (gesturing at the sax on its
                    stand)
               He can't.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
                   (casually)
               How did you find him? It's such an out of
               the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?

                         FREDDIE
               No thanks.
                   (explaining his detective work)
               Some kid at the American Express Office.
                   (he starts to explore)
               Are you living here?

     Now he starts to hammer a nasty boogie-woogie on the piano.

                         RIPLEY
                   (returning, flinching)
               No. No, I'm staying here for a few days,
               in Rome.  That's a new piano, so you prob -

               Rome.

                         VERRECCHIA
               Of course!

     He stands and takes the letter out.  Begins to read. He has
     the look of a man whose privacy has been violated.

                         RIPLEY
                   (to Peter)
               It's a suicide note.
                   (to Verrecchia)
               You ask me all these questions and you've
               already read this suicide note?

     INT. PETER SMITH-KINGSLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

     There's music everywhere - and stands - and posters of
     performances and PHOTOGRAPHS OF PETER CONDUCTING. Peter is an
     opera repetiteur. Ripley is sitting at Peter's piano, playing
     from the score of Vivaldi's <i>Stabat Mater</i>. Peter's made supper.
     He's setting the table.

                         PETER
               Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill
               Freddie, what must that be like? To wake
               up every morning, how can you? Just wake
               up and be a person, drink a coffee...?

                         RIPLEY
               Whatever you do, however terrible,
               however hurtful - it all makes sense,
               doesn't it? inside your head. You never
               meet anybody who thinks they're a bad
               person or that they're cruel.

                         PETER
               But you're still tormented, you must be,
               you've killed somebody...

                         RIPLEY
               Don't you put the past in a room, in the
               cellar, and lock the door and just never
               go in there? Because that's what I do.

	Done to a driving Chicago blues, the sequence is designed to
	establish somewhat the milieu of the stranger, known to
	friends and enemies alike as Hooker.  We see the following:

	EXT. PAWNSHOP - LOOKING INSIDE - DAY

	Hooker is getting a radio and well-worn suit out of hook.
	It's like seeing old friends again.  All pantomime.

	A shabby little place he rents above a cigar store.  We pick
	him up in a jerry-built outdoor shower, which he's rigged up
	on the fire escape.  The rinse water drips down through the

	Hooker nods.  Gondorff switches on the carousel and steps
	back to admire his handiwork.  The carousel makes a grinding
	sound, does a few lurches and stops cold.

	Music begins and we are into a short:

	MONTAGE SEQUENCE

	Detailing the arrival of the others three members of
	Gondorff's "mob." Throughout, Gondorff wears the fedora hat
	which is his trademark.  We begin with --

	A tall, good-looking man, Kid Twist, making his way through
	the railway station.  Impeccably dressed and carrying a
	small suitcase, he combs the terrain carefully with his eyes.
	Finally he catches a glimpse of the thing he's been looking
	for.  It's Gondorff, standing by a newsstand.  Gondorff
	makes a quick snubbing motion on his nose as if flicking off
	a gnat.  This is known among con men as the "office." Twist
	returns the sign with a barely discernible smile as he walks
	on by.  Con men rarely acknowledge each other openly in
	public, but it's obvious that these two are glad to see each
	other.

	Billie has finished  gathering the mugs, and leaves the room
	with them.  We follow her down the hall and into the:

	RECEIVING ROOM OF HER BROTHEL

	Carousel music filters up from the arcade below.  The room
	has a bar along one wall and the rest of the space is taken
	up by tables and couches.  It's a comfortable place, but not
	opulent.  Some of the girls sit patiently on the couches,
	others play canasta at the tables.  Most of the men are at
	the bar, fortifying themselves for the task at hand.  Billie
	comes over to the bar.

			Set me up five more beers, will ya

	As Danny goes to fill the mugs, Billie's eyes fix on a man
	at the end of the bar.

	We move to reveal Snyder, intently scanning the room, as if
	he'd lost a dancing partner in the crush.  Not finding what
	he wants, he comes down the bar to Billie.

	Hooker and Loretta are asleep against each other, their

	FADE IN:

	We open on Hooker in bed, the morning sun streaming in on
	his face.  He awakens slowly, looks at the ceiling for a
	second and, remembering last night, turns to the side to
	find that Loretta is no longer there.  Still drowsy, he gets
	out of bed and looks around the room for a note or some
	evidence of her continued presence.  He opens an empty
	closet, then opens empty drawers.  Finding nothing, he
	suddenly hits on another possibility, and looks in his
	wallet.  The money is still there.  Almost disappointed, he
	slumps down in a chair, as the harsh reality of what will
	happen this day floods back in on him.  Music begins and we:

	Wrapped inside is a shiny black revolver, at this point in
	two pieces.  The hand reaches in and takes them out.

INT. THE STORE

	The store is buzzing with activity.  Money and booze are
	everywhere.  The sheet writer and the boardmarker can hardly
	keep up with the action.  Lonnegan walks quickly to the
	betting line and finds to his relief that there's only one
	man ahead of him.  The man puts $25,000 on King's Image.

	Lonnegan steps to the window, swings up the brief case, and
	opens it for Niles to see.

LATER.  Travis and Betsy are in TIMES SQUARE, turning the
corner from Broadway to 42nd Street. Travis carries the

They approach the garish marquee of a large midtown porno
theatre advertising "The Swedish Marriage Manual". The box
office is flanked on both sides by glass cages filled with
explicit publicity stills.  Offending portions have been
blocked out with black tape.

Travis steps over to the window and buys two $5 tickets.
Betsy, befuddled, watches him. She doesn't know what to say.
Travis returns with the tickets.

TOM is silently reading something on the podium, and BETSY

            Rock music died in 1970, that's
            what I think.  Before that it was
            fantastic.  I can tell you that.
            Everybody was crashing, hanging out
            at the Fillmore.  Me and my

Sport slowly grinds his hips to hers.  Iris starts to move
with him.  This is what she really wanted.  Her man's
attention.

            I know this may not mean anything
            to you, baby, but sometimes I get
            so emotional, sometimes I think, I
            wish every man could have what I
            have now, that every woman could be
            loved the way I love you.  I go
            home and I think what it would be
            without you, and then I thank God
            for you.  I think to myself, man,
            you are so lucky.  You got a woman
            who loves you, who needs you, a
            woman who keeps you strong.  It's
            just you and me.  I'm nothing
            without you.  I can go like this
            for ever and ever.  We can do it,
            baby.  You and me.  Just you and me.

Sport slowly rubs his crotch into her.  Iris smiles.  She is
happy.  The music rises.

               I'm not sure... you were flying
               this weird old stunt plane...
               doing flips... walking on the
               wings... I was watching from the
               ground -- when you fell.  You had
               a parachute, but you wouldn't open
               it.

     Dietrich cracks it open -- powder sifts into a big high-
     ball glass filled with mescal.  he hands it to Archer.

               How about one of your famous

     They all look expectantly at Archer... he's at a loss.

     Silence -- then they crack up.  Reluctantly, Archer
     swallows the tumbler of mescal... he fights back the urge
     to puke.

     She drags him onto the glass floor.  Cindee puts on some

     "dancing," grinding Archer between their taut bodies.  He
     tries to avoid it, but Livia kisses him -- hot, moist.

     Archer's eyes fall on the series of abstract paintings.

     The twisted renderings make his head spin worse... as he
     starts to hallucinate... surrounded by enemies -- he
     struggles to regain control of his battered psyche.

     Archer has his mouth under the tap -- drinking greedily.
     Woozy, he takes a breath... and notices a reflection in
     the window above the sink.  Archer turns to see -- Sasha.

                             ARCHER
               -- Sasha Hassler.  Age 35.  Met

          Shots of George doing stand up on stage at a comedy club.
          The place adores him. We see quick images of him after the

          George sits back down, the thrill of his performance is gone,

          begins watching his show from the same spot it was at before.

          GEORGE wakes up in a large, clean, modern house. He is all
          alone. We get the feeling that he hired someone to decorate
          his house. It is very nice, but doesn't seem personal to him
          at all. It feels new, with all the gadgets, but a little
          cold. On the kitchen table is a stack of scripts he is
          supposed to read.

          He's feeling great. It's a nice day. He's been to church.
          He hears the music of Italy in his soul. As he's crossing

          Decides not to. He rides away in his direction. The CAMERA

          time. He no longer hears the crowd shouting, nor anything
          else except the music, and music seems to be carrying him
          forward. His face registers the emotion of hearing it...of
          giving himself over to it...and of a kind of farewell to'it.

          He sees them right in front of him. The Italian music is
          still playing as he catches up to them and pulls up behind
          Rod who's riding on the inside. They are going around the
          curve. Rod drifts out a bit and that's all the room that
          Dave needs. He takes the inside edge as they come around
          for the final stretch. All three of them stand up and begin
          their final sprint. It looks dead even as they're
          approaching the finish line. A man is waving the checkered
          flag. Then, with about forty yards to go, Dave suddenly
          explodes ahead and wins by an inch or so. He raises his arms
          in the air.

A SERIES OF QUICK SHOTS of different competitors at

          EXT. MALL - DAY
          
          HEAVY METAL MUSIC. A group of anarchist SKATERS rages
          through the mall parking lot tearing up everything they
          see. A couple of them smoke cigarettes. One skater
          grinds over a bench. One kid ollies onto the hood of a
          car. Another slams into an old man and knocks him over.
          
          Meanwhile, Ronnie sits in his golf cart -- waiting. He
          looks eerily like Mel Gibson at the beginning of Mad Max.
          
          The skaters ride past a set of construction cones. One
          skater picks up the cone and tosses it across the parking
          lot.
          
          The skaters soar past Ronnie, who flips on the silent
          orange siren and gives chase.
          
          As the skaters ride through the parking lot, Ronnie pulls
          up and drives alongside of them.

               passion. The MUSIC from downstairs seems LOUDER. Her T shirt 
               is off. Panting, he turns her against the sink.

               Pulls her skirt up, reaches for her panties.

               He does so.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Ross sits at the kitchen table, holding his throbbing head 
               against the POUNDING MUSIC. Greer sets a cup of coffee in 
               front of him, sits across. A long beat. They seem like parents 
               waiting out a teenager's party.

               David thrusts against Berlin, her thighs pound against the 
               edge of the sink. The MUSIC is as LOUD as it is downstairs.

                                     BERLIN
                         Harder.

               They continue in rhythm. She reaches back and pulls him into

               She watches him do so in the mirror.

               INT. LIVING ROOM

               The dancers dance -- the TECHNO PACE has INCREASED even more. 
               One dancer is a blur.

               INT. BATHROOM

               Berlin is pulling David into her. They approach a climax.

               She scratches him on the small of the back. Blood trickles.

               INT. LIVING ROOM

               The MUSIC and dancers are in pure FRENZY. Suddenly, the MUSIC 
               STOPS. Greer stands by the STEREO, his hand coming back from 
               the power button. He gestures "that's-all-folks."

               INT. BATHROOM

               David and Berlin stand still and apart, breathing heavily 
               into the reality-inducing silence. He looks at her in the 
               mirror, a look of shame. She gives him an odd smile.

                         Can't say that. If you say 'there is 
                         no truth,' you're claiming it's true 
                         that there is no truth -- it's a 
                         logical contradiction.

               They come to the stairs and start up.

               In a dark corner of the parking lot sits the pickup from the 
               rest area. The older cowboy watches Bitsey and Zack climb 
               the stairs. On his STEREO, PUCCINI plays. Once they are in 
               their rooms, he TURNS UP the opera, closes his eyes, feels 
               the music.

               INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY

               The car moves through an older Austin suburb with wood framed 
               houses (circa 1950) in varying states of repair.

               It's an overcast day. Zack drives, slowly, searching.

               Bitsey has the passenger seat fully reclined, lies with her 
               eyes closed.

               CLOSEUP - STEREO CLOCK

               reads 1:48. Zack's hand ENTERS the FRAME, turns the MUSIC 
               DOWN.

               SAME SCENE - MINUTES LATER

               Video: The Goth Girl's messy kitchen. Camera zooms in to a 
               perspective similar to that on the Constance tape. The exhibit 
               pieces (kitchen gloves, handcuffs, tape roll) are more-or-
               less where they were before. The Goth Girl enters the frame, 
               she's removing pizza boxes and laundry from the counter.

                         Move those index cards, too.

               She picks up the index cards.

               Zack looks up from a video camera's eye piece. The camera is 
               on the tripod, connected to the Goth Girl's TV. Near it, the 
               hotel TV/VCR. Bitsey cues the Constance tape to the beginning, 
               freezes the image. Zack then checks the camera angle on the 
               Goth Girl's TV. He moves the TVs so that they are side-by-
               side.

               He does so. Bitsey compares perspectives between the left TV 
               (Goth Girl cleaning) to the right TV (Constance).

               The wall clock: 4:50. Dusty hears the PHONE RING over a 
               BARITONE'S ARIA. He turns the MUSIC DOWN, and picks up.

                         Hello?

               EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

               The gas station is old, isolated on a country road.

               Closed, dark. By the road, a single light pole illuminates 
               the area -- its light catching the drizzle.

               Directly beneath the pole is a phone booth, where Bitsey 
               waits by the rental car.

               Zack is on the phone with the booth door open. Bitsey stands

               And?

They approach the school.

Austen glances at Jaden's torso and then gets out of the car.

                            JADEN
               Brah? You turn into me and
               I'll kill you - hear?

Austen looks at him. Tears well up in his eyes. He nods.

Emotionless, Jaden closes the car door and drives off.

On the pavement, Austen watches him go.

3.74 INT. E3 COUNCIL HOUSE � NIGHT

By torchlight under his duvet, Austen draws a `tat' on his
forearm with a biro that matches Jaden's real tat perfectly.

3.75 INT. JADEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Smoking a bong and drinking, his headphones on and the music
cranked high, Jaden fights an inner battle he can never win.

He looks at his gun on his bedside table. A thing of new evil.

Septic, the wound in his torso is draining him of life.

3.76 INT. CHURCH � DAY

Jaden and Austen kneel beside Paul in prayer. Except that
Jaden only kneels on one knee and Austen on neither; and
neither of them are really praying. Beside them Paul prays
with worshipers in the congregation of a dozen or so.

Jaden's hoodie hood is down out of respect. Austen has his
hoodie hood up. Jaden pulls it down. Austen throws him a look,
kisses his tongue. Jaden's eyes darken. Austen relents.

Jaden looks over, sees a man who seems wrong in here. He
twigs: plain clothes COP. Cops don't pray and this one is.

He won't make it.

3.78 INT. E3 HOUSE � NIGHT

Lycia cowers in a corner. Three masked guys stand over her.
One has the shank pointing at her, accusing, hating her. This

His name is LINDEN (30). He is J.C.'s brother.

Sepia.   A sickly Darwin writes at his desk.

                     DARWIN (V.O.)
           Therefore I should infer from analogy
           that probably all the organic beings
           which have ever lived on this earth have
           descended from some one primordial form,
           into which life was first breathed.

INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kaufman looks off into space, thinking. Silence. Suddenly,
he grabs his mini-recorder and paces like a caged animal.

                     KAUFMAN
           Okay, opening of movie. Four billion
           years ago. Life has not begun. Endless,
           barren terrain. Silence. Silence.

EXT. SHOW HALL - DAY

Blasting music.   Crowds.   Laroche shows the flower to Orlean.

                     LAROCHE
           See that nectary all the way down there?
           Darwin hypothesized a moth with a nose
           twelve inches long to pollinate it.
           Everyone thought he was a loon. Then,
           sure enough, they found this moth with a
           twelve inch proboscis -- proboscis means
           nose, by the way -- and --

INT. CHURCH - DAY

VARIOUS SHOTS of a wedding in a tiny country church. We see
shots of Rose in a white wedding dress, smiling, happy. Dave
is stiff and solemn in his best suit. Daddy gravely gives
Rose away. We hear no dialogue here, MUSIC on track. We see
Mother, Buddy, Doll and Waski in the front row, all in Sunday
best and very solemn. We see a CLOSE SHOT of Rose's knees
trembling beneath her white wedding dress as a country
minister marries them. VARIOUS SHOTS of a rather idyllic
country wedding in a very plain, unpretentious country
church, and...

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. CHURCH - DAY

A shot of Rose, Dave, Buddy, Doll and Waski at a picnic
celebration outside the church by a running brook.

The scene should be beautiful in summertime. We see a
barbecue pit, homemade ice cream in the metal can, other
picnic things. A happy Rose is kissing first Buddy, then
Doll, then Waski. Dave smiles fondly, but rather stiffly at
her.

			ROSE 
	And now Waski, are you and Buddy
	and Dolly ready for some ice cream,
	huh? Do you like picnics or don't
	you?

			WASKI 
	We like 'em! We love 'em!

               five...Oh, Lord.  Cut! Cut!

          The MUSIC stops, the girls come to a
          halt -- Morris regards them evenly--

                           MORRIS
               You ladies don't seem to
               realize how valuable my time
               is.  You're going to make my
               boys look bad.

               Why don't you let us come up
               with our own steps?

               We tried that...

          The Girls  fidget--

                           MORRIS
               Now you're in the best
               possible position you can be
               in, so what' s the matter --
               your shoes on too tight or
               something?

               have some asses wiggling, I
               want some perfection. Whawhak!

          The MUSIC starts up -- the Girls start
          dancing.  Morris looks woefully to
          Jerome---

                           MORRIS
               I think I'm going to need a
               drink, a strong drink.

               Let's get the hell out of
               here.

          Morris and Jerome move briskIy down the
          sidewalk--

                           MORRIS
               This just ain't happening. The
               bitches are okay, but we need
               something more exciting-

                           JEROME
               You're right.  We could be
               doing much better.  Any ideas?

              (36) INT. DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT

          as Prince sits by himself in front of
          the mirror, staring at a cassette on the
          counter.  We recognize it immediately as
          the tape Jill gave him earlier,
          containing Lisa's and Wendy's music.  He
          picks it up, snaps it into a ghetto
          blaster.  MUSIC, without lyrics, fills
          the room.  He adjusts the dials, sits
          back and listens a moment.  Suddenly the
          door opens--

                          STAGEHAND
               Prince, five minutes.

          Be snaps off the music, drops the
          cassette into his pocket, cuts out the
          room.

                (37) INT.  BACKSTAGE -- NIGHT

          He comes to the stage-area.  His
          Band.Members are standing about
          anxiously, watching the final moments of
          The Modern Aires' performance.  He cuts
          behind the curtain, peers at the
          crowd...

          ...his eyes fall on Vanity -- his face
          brightens instantly.  Just then Jerome
          and Morris approach her.  Prince shakes
          his head knowingly, offers a wry smile,
          then joins his band.

         (38) INT.  VAN1TY'S TABLE AND CLUB -- NIGHT

          She sits demurely.  Morris' eyes are
          wide and shining -- her beauty up close
          astonishes him--

                           JEROME
               Vanity, I'd like you to meet
               Morris E. Day.

                           MORRIS
               Hold it now -- just leave the
               'E' alone.

               Shit -- it's so rough out
               here.

          Just then a PATROL CAR cruises by.  The
          COP regards them suspiciously.  Morris
          and Jerome snap to attention--

                           MORRIS
               You lock the door, baby?
               Let's go!

          They pile into the Caddy, pull out.

                 (51)  EXT. HIGHWAY -- NIGHT

          The CADDY blazes by in the night.  The
          CITY LIGHTS glimmer spectacularly in the
          distance.

               (52)  INT./EXT. CADDY -- NIGHT

          Jerome drives.  Morris and Vanity sit in
          the backseat. He gazes at her ardently--

                           MORRIS
               Jerome!

          Jerome snaps a look in the rear-view --
          Morris gives him a deft nod. Jerome
          opens the glove compartment, searches
          through the cassette tapes. He finds the
          one he wants, snaps it into the player.
          RESTAURANT AMBIANCE fills the car...

          Note:  The restaurant ambiance will grow
          in volume, and will be followed by
          exaggerated dinner music, punctuated
          with strings and delicate cymbals.  The
          MUSIC plays throughout this scene -- and
          Morris times his words to the ebb and
          flow of the piece to insure the proper
          dramatic effect.

          ...dinner MUSIC begins--

                           JEROME
               Cocktails before dinner?

                           MORRIS
               Yes -- two pi�a coladas.

                           VANITY
               Uh...make mine a virgin.

                           JEROME
               Okay...

          Jerome braces his knees against the
          wheel, pours two premixed coladas into
          plastic glasses--

          PRINCE moves through the trees smiling,
          studying nature--

               you.  Motherfucker, you need a
               haircut!

          He comes to a tree, leans against it
          contentedly, studies the foliage.

          VANITY paces back and forth frantically
          along the stream--

               don't care about anything!  I
               never wanted you to help me
               anyway!

          PRINCE rests by the tree, observes TWO
          HIKERS walking down the path toward him-
          -

                        VANITY (0.S.)

               Morris is better.  I never
               wanted to make it with you
               anyway.

          The Hikers pass him startled--

                           PRINCE
               Good morning.

Just then--

          VANITY is standing by his side, a

          Sir, he's only seventeen-years-old.

          Frank walks into the bar wearing a black suit. He sees his
          father sitting in the corner wearing a POSTAL UNIFORM and
          drinking a beer. The place is filled with the afternoon
          regulars, all watching TV. Frank walks up to his Dad and
          sets a DIME in front of him.

          How about a little music, Dad?

          They kicked me out. They took away
          my membership at the Rotary Club.
          They accused me of terrible things,
          made up a list of lies just to keep
          me out. I'm gonna sue them, a lifetime
          membership is what I have. I have

                   Well?

                                 SOMERSET
                   I'm invited to have a late supper with
                   you and your wife.  And I accept.

     INT.  MILL'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/KITCHENETTE -- NIGHT

     A record player on a moving box PLAYS QUIET MUSIC.

     There's a basketball game with NO VOLUME on the t.v. screen.
     Tracy, Mills and Somerset eat at the kitchen table.  Mills has a
     beeper by his beer and occasionally fingers it absently.

                                 TRACY
                   Why aren't you married, Somerset?

                   I was close.  It just didn't happen.

                           (uncomfortable)
                   This real estate guy... a real scum,
                   brought us to see this place a few
                   times.  And, it was nice enough, and the
                   price was right.  I was thinking it was
                   nothing, but I started to notice, he
                   kept hurrying us along.  I mean what
                   could it be?  Why would he only show it
                   like five minutes at a time, before he'd
                   hustle us out the door?

                   We found out the first night.

     Somerset tries to stay straight, but he can't help laughing.

                   I'm sorry... it's a nice apartment.

     He pulls himself together, but only for a moment.  He can't stop
     it, laughs harder, covering his mouth.  Tracy and Mills laugh.

                                 MILLS

     The record player spins a different album, DIFFERENT MUSIC.
     Tracy's clearing the last dishes into the sink.  Mills and
     Somerset have beers.

                                 SOMERSET

                   didn't have a television.

                   That's weird.  It's un-American.

     An ANGRY COP pounds his nightstick on a glass cage.  Inside the

     reach a door.

     INT.  THE HOT HOUSE, RED ROOM -- AFTERNOON

     Mills and Somerset enter.  ROCK MUSIC CONTINUES, LOUD.  A strobe
     light flashes from the ceiling onto TWO AMBULANCE ATTENDANTS.
     The first attendant places a sheet over a bed, hiding the corpse
     of a WOMAN with long blonde hair.  The second attendant tries to
     examine the pupils of a CRAZED MAN, 55, who sits naked on the
     floor, wrapped in a sheet.  A COP holds the crazed man down.

             Will slams down his empty glass.  Squeezes his eyes open and
             shut.  Loud music.  Cigarette smoke.

                                 WILL
                       I like it fine.

             The guys don't protest.  Will starts heading for the bar.
             Weaving through broad shoulders, massive backs.  Smoke.
             MUSIC.  Laughter.  Arguing.  A mass of bodies and sound.

             SLAM!  Ellie heads through the front door like a gust of

             We hear the TV in the other room.  An older MAN, Ellie's

             big paunch.  Wearing a flannel robe.

More music and another card reads: "Selections From the Bard 
of Mr. Romulus Fabian, Tragedian in Excelsis."  The curtain 
rises and Fabian steps out, a purple velvet cloak wrapped

Bill's mouth drops:

               EXT. SPANKY'S BACK ALLEY (1932) -- NIGHT

               RAY GIBSON holds up a similar bottle of liquor to a light 
               over a door. Music comes from within. He takes a swig and 
               stashes the bottle in his belt. He adjusts his tie, polishes 
               his shoes on the back of his pants and raps on the door.

               INT. SPANKY'S -- NIGHT

               The speakeasy is jumping, jammed with people. Up on stage a 
               hot JAZZ BAND is playing backup for a seductive CHANTEUSE. 
               Well-heeled PATRONS enter through doors near the stage.

               In the back, at the end of a long hallway, a BOUNCER cracks 
               open the door and Ray squeezes inside.

                                     BOUNCER
                         Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's 
                         not happy with you.

          INT. LARRY OSTERBERG'S HOME. DAY
          
          A man is sitting cross-legged on the floor. A joss stick
          burns beside him, and sitar music plays in the background.
          This is LARRY OSTERBERG, and he is meditating. There is a
          loud hammering on the door. Larry shows no sign of having
          heard anything. More hammering at the door, but still no
          response. Then the letter box creaks open and an eye
          appears in the slot. After a moment, the eye disappears
          and Phil's face appears momentarily at the window. The
          window seems to be slightly higher than Phil, so his face
          appears every time he jumps up to peer into the room.

          Then Phil is gone. Larry expels a big breath. The
          letterbox creaks opens again and the eye is back.

KIT
Okay, but I'm going to keep it for a souvenir...

He throws it awav and picks up a smaller one. 

KIT
Or maybe one that's lighter.

He walks over to the car. A bridge is visible in the distance. 

EXT. FIELD 

Kit releases a large red balloon into the evening sky. A small 
basket is fixed to the bottom of the balloon. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
Kit made a solemn vow that he would always stand beside me and 
let nothing come between us. He wrote this out in writing, put 
the paper in a box with some of our little tokens and things, 
then sent it off in a balloon he'd found while on the garbage 
route. (pause) His heart was filled with longing as he watched it 
drift off. Something must've told him that we'd never live these 
days of happiness again, that they were gone forever.

EXT. CATTAILS 

Holly's dog bounds through a stand of cattails. Holly speaks 
angrily to her father, who walks toward the dog with a gun. We do 
not hear their voices, only music. He shoots the dog and Holly 
runs off in horror. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
Then, sure enough, Dad found out I'd been running around behind 
his back. He was madder than I'd ever seen him. As punishment for 
deceiving him, he went and shot my dog.

EXT. BRIDGE 

Holly's father drags a duffel bag out of his truck and dumps it 
over the side of a bridge, into a river. It goes under briefly, 
then bobs to the surface. The current takes it off. 

DISSOLVE TO


EXT. MUSIC SCHOOL 

Holly sits in the second-story window of a music school. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
He made me take extra music lessons every day after school and 
wait there till he came to pick me up. He said that if the piano 
didn't keep me off the streets. maybe the clarinet would.

KIT
She'd get along okay. And if she didn't, well, she could take 
off, just take off, (and) I wouldn't mind... I'd always tell 
people I deserved it.

Holly's father comes to his feet and fixes Kit in the eye. 

FATHER
You get out of here. I don't want you hanging around any more. 
You understand?

He lets these words sink in, then returns to his seat. 

FATHER
(shaking his head) You're something.

Kit waves goodbye. 

KIT
Takes all kinds, sir.

He walks to his car, looking back once. 

SERIES OF ANGLES 

LONG SHOT of father at work at billboard. Kit approaches Holly's 
house, collects the evening newspaper from the sidewalk, and 
knocks on the front door. Holly's father picks her up from a park 
outside the music school. Kit, when he gets no answer, enters the 
house. The jeep, with Holly and her father, rumbles down a 
residential street. 

INT. HOLLY'S HOUSE 

Kit is going through Holly's dresser, throwing her things into a 
suitcase. A pistol is visible in his back pocket. Suddenly, 
Holly's father appears in the dresser mirror, standing at the end 
of the hall outside the bedroom. 

Kit walks forward to greet him. The CAMERA DOLLIES with him. 

KIT
Hi.

FATHER
What're you doing?

KIT
I've got a gun here, sir. It's always a good idea to have one 
around.

Kit draws the pistol. He is shaken, though he must have seen this 
coming.

Cars are parked outside a big abandoned barn as Matt and

EXT.  SNOW'S ISLAND - NIGHT

Marion sits at Cornwallis' ornate, folding campaign desk,
reading Cornwallis' journal, surrounded by Cornwallis'
field gear which includes furniture, music boxes, oil
paintings and an elaborate folding commode.  The TWO GREAT
DANES sit nearby, eyeing Marion warily.

The men have divided themselves into two groups, one
coarse, the other civilized, each clustered around a
separate fire.

The coarse men, including Dalton, Brother Joseph and
RANDOLPH, a grizzled, black-toothed mountain man, drink
and laugh loudly, wearing Cornwallis' wigs askew.

The civilized men, including Rev. Oliver, Gabriel, Scott,
Fielding and Abner, talk quietly.

Marion puts down the journal and walks over to the
campfire where the rougher men are gathered.  He stands
just inside the firelight and speaks loudly, so that all
can hear:

Marion looks at Dalton, then turns to the other men as

At the far end of town Marion, Gabriel, Billings, Dalton,

through the night.

          sits the lone figure of a woman, drinking by herself.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          Medium shot of the same woman as before, finishing the drink 
          she started to take above.  It is Susie.  The music, of course, 
          is now very loud.  Thompson, his back to the camera, moves 
          into the picture in the close foreground.  A Captain appears 
          behind Susie, speaking across her to Thompson.

                                    THE CAPTAIN
                               (a Greek)
                        This is Mr. Thompson, Miss 
                        Alexander.

          Susan looks up into Thompson's face.  She is fifty, trying to 
          look much younger, cheaply blonded, in a cheap, enormously 
          generous evening dress.  Blinking up into Thompson's face, she 
          throws a crink into ther mouth.  Her eyes, which she thinks is 
          keeping commandingly on his, are bleared and watery.

                                    SUSAN
                               (to the Captain)

     Jo Ann like the spotlight and   I was born in King's County
     can't sit still. Teacher        Hospital. My mother moved us
     don't need no outside           to Harlem when I was nine
     policin' tho. She ain'          years old. I'm here to get my
     'fraid. I wonder what is a      G.E.D., then, well I'm
     record layer anyway.            already into the music
                                     industry. I just need to take
                                     care of the education thing

               I could...Could I...go?

     Surprised, Ms. Rain and the class turn to Precious. She is
     visibly uncomfortable and seems as if trying to hide in plain
     sight.

               Okay Claireece.

109   INT. MS. RAIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                           109

      Precious sits at a small kitchen table in a modest but cozy
      and craftily-decorated apartment. Fresh flowers adorne her
      table.

      She breast feeds Abdul and drinks from a tall glass of grape
      juice. Ms. Rain clears the table of plates and take-out
      containers.

      WHITNEY HOUSTON IS PLAYING LOUD. KATHERINE, A SEXY BLACK
      WOMAN who it seems has just awoken, descends the stairs.
      She's not in a good mood.

                Honey, how many times did I tell
                you about the music?

      Katherine bends down to admire Abdul.

                Precious, this is my wife
                Katherine.

      Precious looks confused. She spits her drink out. A lot of
      which lands on Abdul.

      She wipes Abdul.

          A dusty canvas awning over a small cement patio. A decrepit
          picket fence with a sign that reads: MY GREEN HAVEN.
          Estelle looks as if she's about to cry. Jerry puts his arm

          He models in front of the mirror, regarding his bulging T.E.
          He removes a C-cup bra and holds it high. He uses the elastic
          straps to fasten the bra onto his head.

MUSIC FLOODS this exclusive establishment. It's a clash
of cultures and influences not easily dated. A retro
speakeasy for the new millennium.
John walks through a maze of passages while the fantasies
of a twisted city play out in the shadows. He pauses,
sees a clan of suited businessmen in a corner, showing
off for several ladies.
One fills a line of shot glasses from a pitcher of water.
Another waves his hand over them, turns the water into
RED WINE. The ladies are very impressed, drink up.

                 that all there is?

     As she starts to SING, Gary realizes the story isn't hers at

       jump on him. Suddenly, he backs into

      Susan is on her cell phone. A cocktail party is in full
      swing nearby. We can hear the DIN and MUSIC, and see the
      occasional GUEST looking for the restrooms.

                I'm   at the UTA party. Yeah. Did
                you   hear about Ricky's assistant?
                She   literally shat herself. No, I
                saw   it.

      In the background, we see Gavin approaching. Susan spots him
      and seizes up a bit. She holds up a one-sec finger to him as
      she continues her conversation.

                          GAVIN
                I will break your fucking finger.

      She hangs up. They look each other in the eye, daring each
      other to go first.

               BAR BACK OFFICE  NIGHT

               We are tracking past a man seated behind a wooden desk, 
               towards an 8 x 10 black-and-white photograph that has just 
               been slapped down on the desktop.

               The picture is of Abby and Ray in bed together in the motel 
               room.

                                     VOICE
                         I know a place you can get that 
                         framed.

               The voice is familiar as that of the narrator whose musings 
               on life in Texas and the Soviet Union opened the movie.

               We cut to him.

               He is settling himself into a chair facing the desk. He is 
               LOREN VISSER, a large unshaven man in a misshapen yellow 
               leisure suit.

               He smiles at the man behind the desk.

               JULIAN MARTY

               Sits staring down at the photograph. Behind him a window 
               opens on the bar proper. Country-western music filters in 
               from the bar.

               Marty is not pleased.

                                     MARTY
                         What did you take these for?

               He removes a pouch of tobacco from his breast pocket and 
               nonchalantly starts rolling a cigarette.

                         so what do I need these for?

                         now is that you think she came back 
                         here for you--*that's* what's funny.

               Ray moves forward and Marty's eyes follow him as he 
               approaches. Marty's smile abruptly turns to a look of 
               apprehension. Ray enters frame and brushes past Marty as he 
               walks up the stoop, and crosses the back office toward the 
               bar.

               Marty relaxes, and his gaze returns to the furnace.

                         I'll be forced to shoot you...

               Ray opens the door to the bar and shuts it softly behind 
               him.

                                     MARTY

               At the cut the music and all other bar noise drops out. We 
               hear only the rhythmic whir of the fan. We tilt down from 
               the ceiling fan to frame Marty, tilted back in his desk chair, 
               staring up at the fan.

               Meurice is standing in the door to the bar. Far behind him 
               we can see Debra waiting in the dimly lit, deserted bar.

     Pale blue sheets in disarray, the mattress nearly coming off
     the bed, sheets soaked with sweat and the smell of sex.

     A lone condom disregarded on the floor.

     We see his bedside drawer ajar.

          128 INT. CAVE - DAY. 128

          A shaft of light pours through the cave roof high above, BATS
          circling. The dwarves move effortlessly down the labyrinth but
          Snow White and the huntsman have to squeeze through the cracks.

          129 EXT. SANCTUARY - DAY. 129

          Snow White and the huntsman emerge from the cave to see a
          shimmering landscape of glistening moss and sunlight. It's like
          a mirage. The air is filled with specks of pollen and a strange
          HUMMING NOISE echoes like music. For Snow White, it's the most
          beautiful sound she's ever heard. Next to her, Nion, snorts:

                         NION
          Blasted fairy music. Wish I had some wax to
          stuff my ears.

          There's plenty of moss.
          GORT scoops up a handful of moss and moulds himself some ear
          plugs, sticking them in his ears. Snow White is still mesmerized
          by the fairy music and the shimmering haze.

                         SNOW WHITE
          What is this place?

          Gus and Hazel stand outside Van Houten's white house.

           I'm so excited I can barely

                          GUS
           As opposed to other days...?
          She playfully hits him. He takes her arm, picks up the oxygen
          tank, and up they go towards his front door.
          As they approach, there's a noticeable NOISE coming from
          inside the house. It's the deep thump of a BASS BEAT. Loud.
          Like, obnoxiously loud.
          Hazel grabs the brass ornament and knocks. They wait. There's
          no response.

                          GUS
           Maybe he can't hear over the music?
          Gus tries again, this time with more force. Still nothing. He
          tries a third time. Finally, the music stops. They wait.
          Still excited.
          A moment later the door swings open.
          It's a MAN IN PAJAMAS (60s), with a huge potbelly, thinning
          hair, and a week-old beard. All he says is:

          Hazel and Gus are too stunned to react. Through the closed

Pappas dancing alone in the living room with his shirt
off, holding a glass of ouzo.  Facing away from the door

          Hey, babe.  Get on over here so the

              Hello.

    Jenny ignores him.

              Listen. If you've got any sense,
              you wouldn't take a lift from a
              strange man.

    Jenny smiles thinly.

                        DAVID
              I am, however, a music lover, and
              I'm worried about your cello. So                         
              what I propose is, you put it in                         
              the car and walk alongside me.

                        JENNY
              How do I know you won't just
              drive off with the cello?

                        DAVID
              Ah. Good point.

    He winds down the other window and waves on the cars that
    have stopped behind him.

                        DAVID
              How much does a new cello cost?
              Twenty pounds? Thirty? I don't
              know. Let's say thirty.

    He pulls out a wallet, takes out three ten-pound notes,
    hands them to her.

                        DAVID
              There. Security.

    Jenny laughs and waves the money away.

              It was a rehearsal. The concert's

              Elgar.

              Ah, Elgar. I often think it's a
              shame he spent so much time in
              Worcester, don't you? Worcester's
              too near Birmingham. And you can
              hear that in the music. There's a
              horrible Brummy accent in there,
              if you listen hard enough.

    Jenny looks at him and smiles. She hadn't expected him to
    be able to make Elgar jokes.

                        DAVID
              Anyway, I'm not sure Elgar and

They stand at the bar, waiting to be served. Jenny stares

          It's true. And they can't all

          they? Most girls aren't ugly, but
          most girl students are. So there

      Eighteen months later. Swelling orchestral music. Close on        
      Jenny cycling, absorbed, happy, the cello strapped to her
      precariously. The camera pulls back to show her cycling
      through the streets of Oxford. She's done it. We follow her
      for a little while. She dismounts outside a church and
      leans the bike against a wall. Just as she's about to leave
      it, she sees something and freezes. We follow her gaze:
      it's the red Bristol, parked a little way down the road
      just in front of her. She scans the street to see if she
      can find David. She can - he's coming round a corner, a           
      littler further down the street, unwrapping a packet of           
      cigarettes. Jenny moves into his eye-line. He sees her,           
      stops, then walks towards her.

                         Come on.

               He follows her up the stairs.

               EXT. THE STAIRCASE ENTRANCE ON THE STREET

               Loretta and Ronny emerge. He gestures. They enter the 
               apartment building behind the bakery.

               INT. THE PEACOCK CAFE � DAY

               It's a dark Italian coffee and dessert house. Reproductions 
               of Roman statuary adorn grottos and alcoves. In the back is 
               a glass case displaying various desserts, and behind the 
               case, a big burnished gold cappuccino machine. The place is 
               almost empty.

               MUSIC

               An album of "NEAPOLITAN FOLK SONGS" is PLAYING on the cafe's 
               SOUND SYSTEM.

               The CAMERA TRAVELS along the face of an exposed brick wall, 
               DISCOVERING busts of Romans occasionally, and then IT COMES 
               TO the figure of COSMO. He's sitting at a table which is 
               inset into a nook, so we cannot see who he's with.

               DARK NOOK IN THE CAFE

               At a little table away from prying eyes, Cosmo sits with 
               MONA, his girlfriend. Mona is a pretty but overripe Italian 
               woman in her late forties. She's all done up, and she looks 
               at Cosmo with adoration.

                                     COSMO
                         And then there is copper, which is 
                         the only pipe I use. It costs money. 
                         But it costs money because it saves 
                         money.

                                     MONA
                         And what did they say?

               in the doorway with the nurse.

               EXT. ST. VINCENT'S HOSPITAL HELIPORT -- NIGHT

               The helicopter lands and Grandy jumps out.

               MUSIC OUT:

               INT. CORONARY CARE UNIT PRE-OP -- NIGHT

               Wills sits down next to Charlotte's bed. He touches her hand. 
               Her eyes open then close again. Her breathing is heavy and 
               labored.

               Wills pushes a lock of hair off her brow, then whispers, 
               half to himself --

                                     WILLS
                         Time cannot break the bird's wing 
                         from the bird. Bird and wing together 
                         Go down, one feather. No thing that 
                         ever flew, not the lark, not you, 
                         Can die as others do.

               Charlotte's eyes open dreamily. She shows a faint smile at 
               the poem and murmurs almost inaudibly --

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         What have I done to you?

               Wills turns around and sees Grandy standing in the doorway.

               The NURSE rushes over to the gurney and in an instant 
               Charlotte is gone -- wheeled with a bang through SWINGING 
               DOORS into the operating room corridor.

               Everyone is there now -- John, Sarah, Celia, Simon, Dolores, 
               and Shannon. Wills enters silently. He walks to the new 
               arrivals and greets each one with an embrace.

               INT. CORONARY CARE OPERATING ROOM -- NIGHT

               Charlotte lies on the table. Grandy's eyes, visible above 
               his mask, are fiercely focused on his work.

               INT. CORONARY CARE UNIT WAITING ROOM -- NIGHT

               Shannon lies with her head in Sarah's lap.

               Dolores, ignoring the sign, smokes a cigarette.

               John and Celia sit side-by-side in silence.

               Wills stands at the window. He looks over and see Simon 
               standing close by. Simon looks at him, his eyes sad but eerily 
               calm. Wills shakes his head --

                         It happened so quickly. We'd just 
                         talked about the surgery. She agreed 
                         to it. But I thought there'd be time.

        The room is painted white and completely empty with a steeply
sloping    ceiling. Agnes is sitting on a chair with her eyes closed,
already under   hypnosis. Martha and Mother Miriam are facing her.

                         You're listening to a chorus of angels.
                         The music surrounds you like a...
                         warm and, comfortable pool of water.
                         And while you're sleeping, you're
                         going to be able to recall, all the things
                         that we want you to remember. And
                         when I count to three and clap my hands,
                         you'll no longer be hypnotised. Can you

                       I don't know the meaning behind the
                       song she sang. Perhaps it was a song
                       of seduction. And the father was a
                       fieldhand. Perhaps the song was simply
                       a lullaby that she remembered from many
                       years ago. And the father was hope and...
                       and love and desire. And a belief in
                        miracles.

        The nuns are seen walking together through the snow back to
the
convent over    which Agnes' singing can be heard.

                       I want to believe that she was blessed.
                       And I do miss her, and I hope that she's
                       left something, some little part of
                       herself with me. That would be miracle
                       enough wouldn't it?


       DISSOLVE TO:

93   EXT - TOP OF BELLTOWER - DAY

        Where Agnes is singing her song among the doves. She stops
singing and the music fades in on the same key. Agnes gently takes
on of the doves and lets
        it fly away across the snowy landscape.

       FADE OUT.

                         Hey Ruby! Got a new fiddle -- it's 
                         got a little snake's rattle in the

                         in Virginia. That's a beautiful 
                         fiddle. It's full of tunes, Ruby. 
                         Don't know if it's from that little 
                         rattle locked up in it, or from

               decorations. Ada, Ruby and Sally Swanger, her hair now almost 
               completely white. Some token presents. Pangle is picking at 
               a banjo, his grin infectious, and a third player, GEORGIA, 
               with a harmonica. As they play:

	 Was she that bad?

As Addison speaks, he rises with excitement.

			ADDISON
	 Margo, as you know, i have lived in
	 the Theater as a Trappist monk
	 lives in his faith. I have no other
	 world, no other life - and once in
	 a great while I experience that
	 moment of Revelation for which all
	 true believers wait and pray. You
	 were one. Jeanne Eagels another...
	 Paula Wessely... Hayes - there are
	 others, three or four. Eve
	 Harrington will be among them...

			MARGO
		(flatly)
	 I take it she read well.

			ADDISON
	 It wasn't reading, it was a
	 performance. Brilliant, vivid,
	 something made of music and fire...

			MARGO
	 How nice. 

			ADDISON
	 In time she'll be what you are. 

			MARGO
	 A mass of music and fire. That's
	 me. An old kazoo and some sparkles.
	 Tell me - was Bill swept away, too,
	 or were you too full of Revelation
	 to notice?

			ADDISON
	 Bill didn't say - but Lloyd was
	 beside himself. He listened to his
	 play as if someone else had written
	 it, he said, it sounded so fresh,
	 so new, so full of meaning...

Addison, of course, knows exactly what she's doing. He senses

	 Eve was incredibly modest. She

	 the nonsense I take from you -
	 you'd better stick to Beaumont and
	 Fletcher! They've been dead for
	 three hundred years! 

He stalks into the wings. Bill's reaction to the fight is
typical. He lights a cigarette, stretches out on the covered
bed. Eve stands frozen with fear. Margo yells after Lloyd
into the wings. 

			MARGO
	 And they're getting better
	 performances today than they ever
	 got! All playwrights should be dead
	 for three hundred years!

Lloyd comes out of the door leading to the auditorium. The
battle goes on without a pause. As he yells back, he crosses
to Max at row A, center. 

			LLOYD
	 That would solve none of their
	 problems - because actresses never
	 die! The stars never die and never
	 change!

He starts up the aisle with Max. 

			MARGO
	 You can change this star any time
	 you want! For a new, fresh,
	 exciting one fully equipped with
	 fire and music! Any time you want -
	 starting with tonight's
	 performance!

Now it's Max who stops and shouts back at her.

			MAX
	 This is for lawyers to talk about,
	 this concerns a run-of-the-play
	 contract, and this you can't
	 rewrite or ad lib!

			MARGO

	 Are you threatening me with legal
	 action, Mr. Fabian?

	 Are you breaking the contract?

		(from the top of the

	 I shall never understand the weird
	 process by which a body with a
	 voice suddenly fancies itself a
	 mind! Just when exactly does an
	 actress decide they're her words
	 she's saying and her thoughts she's
	 expressing? 

			MARGO
	 Usually at the point when she's got
	 to rewrite and rethink them to keep
	 the audience from leaving the
	 theater!

			LLOYD
	 It's about time the piano realized
	 it has not written the concerto!

Max has already walked out unhappily. Lloyd now slams out.
Margo glares after him, then turns to Bill who smokes his
cigarette peacefully on the bed. 

			MARGO

	 And you, I take it, are the

WE HEAR LOUD DANCE MUSIC. SLY AND THE FAMILY STONE. JACOB is with some 
POST OFFICE EMPLOYEES at a crowded party in a small apartment. A DRUNK 
is telling a bad joke and trying to hold a glass of wine at the same 
time. It is constantly on the verge of spilling. JACOB is fixated on 
it. In the background, we see JEZZIE dancing and motioning for JACOB to 
join her. He nods no. The DRUNK, who keeps asking people if they "get 
it," takes JACOB's head nodding as a sign of confusion and keeps trying 
to re-explain the joke.

JACOB hears a strange noise and looks around. It seems to be coming 
from a covered bird cage. He goes over to it and lifts the cover. The 
BIRD is flapping its wings wildly as if trying to get out. The sound, 
loud and insistent, startles him. He lowers the cover.

In the DINING ROOM, several people are gathered around ELSA, an 
attractive black woman who is reading palms. She sees JACOB and calls 
over the music.

				ELSA
		Hey, you! Let me look at your hand!

JACOB shrugs. DELLA, dancing nearby, calls out.

		Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a

		No, thanks.

		It's fun.

CUT TO A CLOSE UP OF JACOB'S HAND. ELSA is squeezing the mounds and 
examining the lines. What begins as a playful expression on her face 
turns suddenly serious. She reaches for his other hand and compares the 
two of them. JEZZIE looks over from her dancing and eyes the scene 
jealously.

His eyes focus on the moon. Rings of light emenate from it filling the 
sky with their sparkling brilliance. The rings draw us forward with a 
quickening intensity that grows into exhilarating speed. The rush 
causes them to flash stroboscopically and produces a dazzling, almost 
sensual, surge of color. The display is spectacular and compelling.

Music can be heard in the distance, growing hard and insistent, like a 
heart beat. Heavy breathing accompanies the sound. The stroboscopic 
flashes are replaced by intense flashes of red and blue light. The 
music grows louder and reaches a thundering crescendo. Then silence.

Suddenly the flickering rings begin to define a tangible image, a 
kind of CELESTIAL STAIRCASE, rising up into infinite dimensions. 
As we speed toward it, it grows increasingly majestic. The image 
is so awesome and other-worldly that it is difficult to grasp 
what is being seen.

Music can be heard in the distance. It too is celestial in its 
beauty. Then, unexpectedly, it grows hard and insistent, like a 
heartbeat. Heavy breathing accompanies the sound. The image of 
the STAIRCASE shatters and disappears, replaced by intense 
flashes of red and blue light. The music grows louder and reaches 
a thundering crescendo. Then silence.

           No... I was thinking I was wrong.
                         
                          JIM
           About what?
           53.
                         
                         
          Selena doesn't reply for a moment. Then she turns to look at
          Frank and Hannah - who look oddly normal, surrounded by the
          food wrappers from the picnic, Frank listening to the radio.

          Claire?

                     CLAIRE
          Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.

She clicks off the phone and looks down at the calm water.

INT.  WORK ROOM - NIGHT

Claire sits in a small workroom at a computer.  She focuses
intently on the screen.

ANGLE

It's ALICE'S COMPUTER SOLITAIRE.  She flips the last card and
an animated Queen of Hearts, accompanied by a series of
musical notes, parades across the screen.

                     QUEEN OF HEARTS
               (on computer)
          You lost!  Off with your head!

Claire hits "New Game" and watches as a fresh hand of cyber
solitaire is dealt.  She suddenly has a thought and
disappears into the kitchen.

INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

She glances at Jody's tea, smiles, then refills her glass of
red wine.  She picks up the phone from its cradle and moves
into:

INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

She dials a number.  LOUD REGGAE can be heard blaring through
the phone.

                     CLAIRE
               (straining to be heard)
          Hello?  I'm looking for Caitlin Spencer.
          She's in 314...Well, could you check?

She plugs one ear.

The noise abruptly stops.  Claire clicks off the phone and
replaces it in the sweater pocket.  She tunes the stereo to a
classical music station.

INT.  WORK ROOM - NIGHT

She walks in, places the cordless phone on a BASE UNIT, then
hears a different set of musical notes from the computer.
She stares at the screen, stunned.

The game has been finished.  Cards with faces swarm
chaotically across the screen with the message:  YOU WIN!

                     CLAIRE
          Oh.  Kay.

Without warning, the radio dial rips cacophonously past
several stations and comes to a stop on some angry, punkish
rock and roll.

                     CLAIRE
          Jesus...

She bolts around a corner to the stereo.  The music is
chaotic and deafening.  She finds Cooper growling at...no
one.  She turns off the stereo.  Cooper suddenly bolts down
the hall.  She follows him.

POV - THE GARDEN

No sign of the dog.

Claire turns to go back inside.  When she touches the
doorknob, she hears the whispering again.  A fleeting shadow
draws her eye to a COAT RACK MIRROR which reflects directly
into the study.

                     CLAIRE
          Hello...?!

The whispering stops.

          No.  Look!  In the window.

The ROSES.  She points out a HAZY FIGURE in the TURRETED
WINDOW of the study.  Norman takes it over to the light.

                     NORMAN
          It's a flare.

                     CLAIRE
          A flare?

                     NORMAN
          From the sun.  It's a reflection on the
          glass.

                     CLAIRE
          It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered
          and turned on the music.  She's trying to
          contact me!

                     NORMAN
               (making sure he's got it)
          It's a ghost.

Norman shakes his head.  He looks again at the picture, does
a quick calculation.

                     NORMAN
          You took this in the morning, didn't you?

She nods slightly.

                     NORMAN
          When the sun would be exactly right.

She's got him.

                     CLAIRE
          Then why isn't it in any of the other
          pictures?

She thrusts the batch at him.  He peruses the other few shots
of the garden.

          Are you glad?  I'm glad.

Norman walks over to her and cradles her chin with his hand.

                     NORMAN
               (softly)
          You know I am.

                     CLAIRE
          Good.
               (She gazes at him, then
                softly)
          You sat in front...I saw you there...

Norman takes his cue.

                     NORMAN
          You were lost in the music...eyes
          closed...your chest heaving...

               (overlapping)

EXT.  COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - NIGHT

Claire stands outside Caitlin's Columbia dorm, watching young
lives in motion.

INT.  DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT

Claire walks past a number of doors.  Music booms out of one,
shards of a conversation out of another.  Finally, she
arrives at a door that says "Fur is murder."  She smiles to
herself and knocks.  There's no answer.

                     DIFFERENT VOICE (O.S.)
          She's out.

Claire turns to find an attractive YOUNG MAN standing at her
elbow.

                     YOUNG MAN
          They're playing at CBGB's down on Bowery.
          Probably won't be back for awhile.  You
          her mom?

                     CLAIRE
          Yes.  Who was playing?

                     YOUNG MAN
          Bitch.  Caitlin's band.

          Yeah.  They're really good.  I would have
          gone, but I have a paper.
               (beat)
          And I'm not just saying that because
          you're a mother.

Claire nods slightly.

                     CLAIRE
          Thank you.

She walks down the hall.

INT.  CBGB'S - NIGHT

Claire moves past a huge, BLACK SKINHEAD DOORMAN into an
entrance area in the dark throbbing punk club.  She looks out
over the MOB OF SEETHING YOUNG PEOPLE, swaying to a pulsing
power-pop band.  PUNKS and CLUB KIDS push past her as they
move into the throng.  She looks up and her face changes.

CLAIRE'S POV

A shaggy trio of musicians on the stage, pumping through a
jangly, but surprisingly melodic song.  Her eyes race across
the faces of a BUTCH FEMALE DRUMMER, an emaciated
GUITARIST/SINGER and stop on the BASS PLAYER...Caitlin.  She
rocks back and forth to her own hypnotic bass line, EYES
CLOSED, SWAYING TO THE MUSIC.

Claire is transfixed, her face a mix of pride and sadness.
The song ends and Caitlin's eyes open.  She smiles for a
moment, then the smile fades as she spots Claire.  Panicked,
Claire ducks behind a pillar.

EXT.  CBGB'S - NIGHT

The last groups of YOUNG PEOPLE file out of the club.  A
couple of them glance at Claire, who seems very out of place
standing on the Bowery late at night.

                     VOICE (O.S.)
          Mom?

She turns to see Caitlin standing before her, a bass guitar
case on a strap over her shoulder.  There's an awkward pause.

          That was very good.

different men, others with rough looking friends.  Claire
stops at a picture tucked into a mirror.

INSERT

Madison singing at a recital of some kind.  She's lovely,
with striking GREEN EYES.  Around her neck is a distinctive
SILVER NECKLACE, with a perfectly wrought, SILVER ROSEBUD.

                     MRS. FRANK
          Such a pretty voice.  Surprised she didn't
          major in music.

          That's the last picture.

A phone rings in the hallway.

                     MRS. FRANK
          S'cuse me.

Claire's eye is pulled past the picture into the mirror, the
reflection of something pinned to the edge of a bulletin
board.  She turns and moves over to:

A SHORT BLOND BRAID.  She reaches out to touch it.  Claire
hears footsteps.  Mrs. Frank leans back into the room.

                     MRS. FRANK
          They're calling me in to work.

                     LOUIS
          A letter.  May I see?

He takes the letter; she has no resistance against him.  The
King reads, his eyes hardening suddenly; but then he smiles.

                     LOUIS
          From Raoul.  He urges you to guard
          your honor -- as if it could be in
          any danger... from your king.

                     MICHELLE
          Raoul... is in love...

                     LOUIS
          Enough of this, our dinner waits.

Tossing the letter aside, he offers her his arm.  She takes
it and allows him to escort her from the room.

INT.  PALACE - THE HALL OF MIRRORS

The hall is alive with glorious light, fiery gold frames
surrounding silvery mirrors blazing with reflections.
Musicians line the length of the hall, and when Louis and
Michelle appear at the far doorway they begin playing for the
couple as they parade past.  Michelle is speechless, as Louis
smiles at her awed innocence.

INT.  ROYAL DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Louis leads Michelle into a towering room surrounding a
magnificent table, decked out with candelabra and sumptuous
delicacies -- set for just two.

THE DINNER

Louis and Michelle sit opposite each other, attended by a
dozen servants.  Michelle stares at her plate.

                     LOUIS
          The food doesn't please you?

          Nothing, I -- continue.

Louis rejoins the dancing... and then sees, on the balcony
above him, a different person -- a huge "woman," Porthos --
who lifts off an outer mask to reveal an iron mask below.

                     LOUIS
          There!  Do you see it?

                     YOUNG BEAUTY
          See what, Majesty?

Porthos has slipped away from the railing when the King looks
back up; the young beauty sees nothing, and turns back to the
King with a look that questions his sanity.

D'Artagnan notices the King's reaction -- though he did not
see the glimpse of the iron mask -- and is just as baffled as
everyone else when the King turns and staggers away.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Your Majesty...?

                     LOUIS
          ... tired.  Must... lie down.

The music splatters to an awkward stop; Louis hurries out,
leaving his partner abandoned in the center of the ballroom,
with everyone staring as if she just ruined the party.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Carry on, everyone...

The music begins again, and the party goers, not knowing what
else to do, politely continue.

Athos draws Phillippe away from the ballroom, into a side
corridor.

AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS TO THE BALCONY

Porthos waddles down stairs, and meets Aramis.

                     ARAMIS
          Quick, to the passages.

They hurry in the same direction Athos and Phillippe went.

INT.  PALACE HALLWAY - OUTSIDE THE KING'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

D'Artagnan catches up to the King as he is entering the door
of his royal apartment.

          There!  Do you see it?

                     YOUNG BEAUTY
          See what, Majesty?

Porthos has slipped away from the railing when the King looks
back up; the young beauty sees nothing, and turns back to the
King with a look that questions his sanity.

D'Artagnan notices the King's reaction -- though he did not
see the glimpse of the iron mask -- and is just as baffled as
everyone else when the King turns and staggers away.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Your Majesty...?

                     LOUIS
          ... tired.  Must... lie down.

The music splatters to an awkward stop; Louis hurries out,
leaving his partner abandoned in the center of the ballroom,
with everyone staring as if she just ruined the party.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Carry on, everyone...

The music begins again, and the party goers, not knowing what
else to do, politely continue.

Athos draws Phillippe away from the ballroom, into a side
corridor.

AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS TO THE BALCONY

Porthos waddles down stairs, and meets Aramis.

                     ARAMIS
          Quick, to the passages.

They hurry in the same direction Athos and Phillippe went.

INT.  PALACE HALLWAY - OUTSIDE THE KING'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

D'Artagnan catches up to the King as he is entering the door
of his royal apartment.

                     D'ARTAGNAN
          Your Majesty, is there anything -- ?

The King shuts the door in d'Artagnan's face.

INT.  BALLROOM - NIGHT

As a minuet ends, Claude raises his glass in a toast.

                     CLAUDE
          To King Louis!  And to Anne, the
          Queen Mother!

The guests applaud and reach for wine glasses; servants
present Phillippe and Anne with champagne, and they sip --

                     GUESTS
          To King Louis, and the Queen Mother!

Everyone drinks; Phillippe suddenly remembers to hold his
glass in his fingertips -- and it slips through his nervous
fingers, hitting the floor with a crash.

Dead silence; everyone is looking.  Then Anne drops her glass
too -- and everybody does it, as if to break the glass is
part of the celebration.

As the music begins again, Anne leans to Phillippe --

                     ANNE
          I retire now.  Wait two waltzes,
          then retire to your room; and spend
          the night in safety.  We have much
          to talk about, and have the rest of
          our lives to do it.

                     PHILLIPPE
          Good night, Mother.

                     ANNE
          Good night... my son.

She kisses him on the cheek; it brings tears to both of them.
She moves to the door, everyone bowing as she leaves.

JUST OUTSIDE THE BALLROOM DOOR

Anne encounters d'Artagnan.  He stops, so taken by the sight
of her that no one seeing them could miss that he loves her.

    The PRIEST sprinkles the ring with holy water. WILLIAM CAREY,
    (35), puts it on MARY's finger.

      few rows back, a young NOBLEMAN stares at ANNE. Looks at her
    across the church. Obviously attracted. ANNE notices.

1   MUSIC UP. It's a tad eerie. If a Zydeco band died in a     1

    FADE IN ON:
    WHITE SCREEN
    which transforms to a milky white and eventually into a
    bright high noon sun. A large black bird flies in circles
    overhead. As it wipes the sun a bright flare causes...
    CLOSEUP - PAIR OF EYES
    to squint, then adjust to the light and finally open.    They
    look tired, but content, maybe even relaxed.
    CLOSEUP - MAN

    the owner of the eyes. Though we only see from his shoulders
    to the top of his head, we can tell he's lying in a field.
    His arm is propped behind his head as a pillow and he appears
    to be resting comfortably. MUFFLED VOICES and WHISPERS fill
    the air but they seem to come from another place. The man
    doesn't notice them. His name is BUTCH.
    A gust of wind blows Butch's hair a bit and a piece of straw
    wipes across his forehead. Then, oddly enough, it is followed
    by a dollar bill, which rests against his cheek, then skitters
    across his face. It is followed by another and another, a
    five, a ten, a single. Butch pays no attention. He's in
    another world.

     Bishop. He croons sweetly and beautifully. Claude's eyes
     moisten. Margot swallows a blue pill and chases it with the

               I'm sorry, sweety. There's

               Appealing to my grandfather's
               stoic belief in the primacy of
               European culture in all its forms,
               Doc offered to instruct me in
               piano in return for my helping
               him locate and gather his precious

               most important, he would tell me,
               and I would believe him.

                         My loneliness was unbearable, man. 
                         Weekends were the worst. Sometimes

                         My niece sells these creams. And
                         just look at my skin now. I'm going

               The woman continues her banal chatter. Chieko observes her

                grabs Chieko by the hand, pulls her toward the floor and

                The other deaf-mutes also dance. Some do better than others,
                lost in the sea of lights and people.
          
                For Chieko, the dance turns into something hypnotic. She
                dances with her eyes closed, concentrated on her own rhythm.
          
                When she opens her eyes, she sees that Mitsu, a little drunk,
                is grinding against Haruki, feeling him up.

          in the distance. He stands staring at the fire, the warmth
          and light moving him, enlivening him and not frightening him
          at all. The BOY has got up and appears at his side, yawning.
          He looks at the sky at a single gray SNOWFLAKE drifting down.

                         HELEN
          I love your husband, Ellie, but he's
          a real dork.

                         ELLIE
          Yeah, but he's my dork.

INT.  MIKE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Night has descended, PEOPLE talking and laughing quietly,
MELLOW music is playing -- CAMERA FINDING MIKE AND ELLIE,
dancing close, moving sensually.  It's impressive.  HELEN
convinces T.J. to DANCE.  SCOTTY and BIMBO join in too.
T.J., whipped, extricates himself and Helen; tousling
Mike's hair in affection.

                         T.J.
          We're goin'.  Get some sleep,
          Detective Keegan.  You got a new job
          tomorrow.

MIKE is holding TOMMY asleep on his shoulder.

ELLIE appears, completing the family portrait.

                         MIKE
                  (a whisper)
          Think I should put the skateboard in
          bed with him?

NEIL stares, polite, as WIN whisks her away; turning, as
he is addressed by someone else coming his way.


EXT.  THE CLUB - NIGHT

as a BLACK PORSCHE PULLS UP, its dark-tinted window
rolling down TO REVEAL JOEY VENZA.  The MANAGER of the
club comes over to him, with a clipboard list of only the
invitees.

VENZA jams the ACCELERATOR to the FLOOR, the CAR burning
rubber like a DRAGSTER as PEOPLE SQUEAL and JUMP OUT of
the way; the CAR fish-tailing away, screeching AROUND the
CORNER.


INT.  CLUB - NIGHT

WIN and CLAIRE.  The music, noise, other conversations can

He smiles, mid-conversation; there's a real affection

          The main floor stays public.  The

FRED nods, putting down his case cutter, using a side
exit.

WIN, left alone, turns to look up proudly at his
powerhouse modern art collection lining the wall.


INT.  MEZZANINE - NEAR ELEVATOR - NIGHT

CLAIRE extricating herself; to the foursome.

                         CLAIRE
          I will... I promise...

She smiles graciously and steps into the freight elevator,
pushing the down button.  The doors close.


INT.  BASEMENT TUNNELS - NIGHT

VENZA approaches an intersection.  Ahead, FRED crosses on
his way to the offices.  The elderly STOCK BOY doesn't see
VENZA, but VENZA sees him, realizing where else to look
here.


INT.  FREIGHT ELEVATOR - NIGHT

CLAIRE closes her eyes, leaning back against the metal
walls, taking advantage of the refuge for the moment.
Music and crowd noise still vibrate.  The elevator,
shuddering, continues its descent.


INT.  RESTAURANT - NIGHT

WIN turns in the silence, looking out over the bright
space edged by darkness, every reason to be pleased.

WIN doesn't even hear VENZA enter.

                         VENZA
                  (bear, icily)
          You need money, you come to me.

WIN turns.

                         VENZA
                  (approaching,
                   soundlessly)
          Who the fuck do you think you are,

Mike emerges from the subway alongside the park.


EXT.  FIFTH AVENUE APARTMENT BUILDINGS - EARLY EVENING

Out front, the DOORMAN opens the door for the building's
children returning from music lessons.

Across the street in Central Park, handsome, elderly
tenants stroll in the company of their nurse:  a nanny
pushes a pram, taking advantage of the last light.  This
is one of New York's most exclusive co-ops.  Distilled
civilization and quiet wealth.  A world away from Queens
or anything else.  MIKE arrives on foot.


INT./ EXT.  LOBBY - EVENING

A notice behind the locked front door informs:  "ALL
VISITORS MUST BE ANNOUNCED".  MIKE displays his shield to
the DOORMAN through the glass.  The DOORMAN opens, taking
the time to inspect his credentials before returning them,
then STEPS ASIDE, allowing ENTRY.


INT.  ELEVATOR - SAME

MIKE rides up in silence, examining the ornate walls.


INT.  VESTIBULE - CLAIRE'S APARTMENT - SAME

The elevator delivers him.  MIKE finds himself in a wall-
papered trompe l'oeil foyer.  Nothing to get his bearings.

The front door clicks open, startling him.  MARY, the
cleaning lady, an older, capable woman in functional
civilian clothes, greets him matter-of-factly, taking him
in.


INT.  CLAIRE'S LIVING ROOM - SAME

Marble-floored and high-ceilinged, absolutely palatial;
MIKE'S EYES registering amazement as he's led inward.

Floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Central Park, where
the VOICES are REVEALED belonging to GARBER, T.J., CLAIRE,
and CLAIRE'S boyfriend, NEIL -- who's trying his best to
be "in charge".

          He thinks you're being a little
          careless.  He made the point several
          times.

MIKE sets down the phone.  They settle back; trying to
feel "comfortable" in one another's presence.  It's plenty
awkward.

                         CLAIRE
          You live in Manhattan?

He politely tries to place it, with no idea.

          I'm supposed to speak at their tenth
          anniversary.

          Nice.  Maybe you'll stop by... have
          an aperitif...

It evokes a slight smile but nothing more.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

Outside and far below, the GLOW from the tip of a
CIGARETTE REDDENS the darkness with an inhalation.

VENZA:  He stands, impervious to the cold, looking up at
the windows of CLAIRE'S apartment.

ANGLE UP TO CLAIRE:  SILHOUETTED in the distant window.

VENZA:  finishes his butt, flicks it, satisfied, getting
into HIS CAR curbside and driving away.

EXT.  CITY STREET - FIFTH AVENUE - NIGHT

Active with nightlife; CAMERA PANNING to a lone figure
walking in the night.  It's MIKE; his collar turned up
against the cold, his face grim and pensive.  He passes an
art gallery and PAUSES to gaze in, his eyes refocusing on
his own reflection staring back at him.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  CLAIRE'S APARTMENT - SAME - NIGHT

CLAIRE immobile, on a window seat in her LIVING ROOM, the
CLASSICAL MUSIC still playing softly in the background,
her eyes empty as she gazes out into the park.

THE MUSIC CONTINUES OVER:

INT.  CLAIRE'S VESTIBULE - NIGHT

T.J., DOZING as the ELEVATOR INDICATOR HEADS UPWARD --
finally reaching our FLOOR.

The DOORS OPEN, STARTLING T.J.  He stares at MIKE with
DISMAY.  MUSIC IS HEARD from just inside.

          Tell me I'm dreamin'.

                         MIKE
          I just gotta talk to her, T.J.

MIKE ENTERS, closing the doors behind him.


INT.  CLAIRE'S APARTMENT - SAME - NIGHT

Silent, save for CLASSICAL MUSIC -- as MIKE quietly
enters.

He pauses a moment, his eyes filled with unhappiness, then
MOVES in the direction of the MUSIC -- SPOTTING CLAIRE,
immobile since we last saw her, still gazing out the
window.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  as always, AFFECTED BY HER.

She becomes aware of his presence and slowly TURNS.  For a
long moment, neither seems willing to move -- or speak.
Finally, he does.

                         MIKE
          T.J. agreed to take my shift.  He
          knows about us.

She absorbs it, without response.

                   difficulty)
          So does Ellie.

She nods.  Thoughtfully.  As though willing to deal with
it intellectually, but avoiding any encounter with her
emotions.

                         CLAIRE
          You told her?

                         MIKE
          Not exactly.

                  (understands; gamely)
          Just putting in an appearance then.

SHE GLANCES around, her "ESCORTS" mistaking it for
anxiety, one of them taking her arm and escorting her in.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  THE BANQUET ROOM - LATER

SPEECHES droning on -- CAMERA FINDING CLAIRE at a round
dinner table, with OTHERS, who think they're engaging her
in conversation; but her thoughts are elsewhere, her eyes
continually glancing toward the doors -- both hoping and
fearing.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  THE BANQUET ROOM - LATER

The SPEECHES have long since ENDED, PEOPLE DANCING, slow
dances to the live orchestra -- CAMERA PANNING to CLAIRE,
sitting in silent isolation at the now sparsely populated
table, having lost hope, feeling utterly alone.  Her chin
is resting in her hand, her eyes fixed sadly on her wine
glass.  PLAINCLOTHESMEN, situated around her, study her
dispassionately.

CLOSE ON HER FACE:  expressionless.  But it slowly gains
animation, as she realizes the MUSIC has changed, made a
segue to something new.  It's "SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME."

SHE LOOKS UP -- to see MIKE; his approach from the
bandstand indicating that the change of music was his
doing.

HER FACE breaks into the most enormous, and grateful,
GRIN.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  returning the smile as he COMES TOWARD.

                         KOONTZ
                  (as he passes)
          Don't do it, man.  I love ya, but
          you're out of your mind.

Uncaring, MIKE MOVES TO CLAIRE.

ANGLE ON BOTH:  gazing at each other.

                         CLAIRE
                  (overwhelmed)
          What a memory.

                         MIKE
          Do you dance?
