		Jack and Bobby are good men.  But it

		toughness to stand up to --

				KENNY
		-- You listen to me.  Nobody, nobody,
		talks about my friends that way.  You're
		fucking here right now because of the
		Kennedys.  They may be wrong.  They make
		mistakes.  But they're not weak. 
		The weak ones are these 'people' who
		can't speak their own minds.

				BUNDY
		You know I don't mean they're weak.

	Kenny gets in his face, intimidating.

				KENNY
		No, they just lack 'moral toughness.' 
		And you think I'll play your Judas.  You
		WASPS and blue-bloods never understood
		us, thinking we want into your club. 
		Well we got our own club now.

		And you guys don't realize fighting with
		each other is our way.  Nobody plays us

	INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - DAY

	Kenny throws himself on a chair in the bedroom's sitting
	area, newspaper in hand.  The President, buttoning his shirt
	in a full-length mirror, sees him.  There's a TV on.  The
	President selects a tie from a nearby rack, eyes the paper.

				THE PRESIDENT
		What's that?

				KENNY
		Oh, just a bunch of crap about
		withdrawing our Jupiter missiles in
		Turkey if the Soviets'll do the same in
		Cuba.

	The President's eyes flick over to him in the mirror.

				THE PRESIDENT
		I don't want to listen to this again.

				KENNY
		If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to
		extortion, and NATO would never trust us
		again.  We'll get clobbered in world
		opinion.

		This isn't a blockade.

	McNamara, trembling with anger, awe, whirls to Anderson.  And
	his burgeoning insight is born - clear, hard and cold.

				MCNAMARA (CONT'D)
		This, all this, is language, a new
		vocabulary the likes of which the world
		has never seen. 
		This is President Kennedy communicating
		with Secretary Khruschev.

	McNamara JABS HIS FINGER OUT AT the plot, and --

	-- the CAMERA RACES DOWN, TRACKING OVER IT, across the vast
	ebb and flow of information, the delicate ballet of symbols
	and numerology, this language of steel and human life.

	opens.  Rusk walks in.

		I have lunch with him maybe once a

                    You want to know who it was? I can
                    tell you. It was a junkie. Or a rival.
                    Or some dumb ass kid trying to make a
                    name for himself. Or someone you forgot
                    to pay off. Or slighted without
                    realizing it. Or someone you put out of
                    business by being too successful.
                           (pause)
                    Success has a lot of enemies. Your
                    success is who took a shot at you. How
                    you gonna kill it? By being
                    unsuccessful? You can be successful and
                    have enemies, or unsuccessful and have
                    friends. It's the choice we make.

               INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY

               Lots of chaos as a TELEVISION NEWS CREW sets up. Roberta 
               tries futilely to get the beginners to pay attention to her.

                                     ROBERTA
                         Kids, listen to me -- it's really 
                         important that you don't look at the 
                         camera and you try to act as natural 
                         as possible.

               Dennis storms in.

                                     DENNIS
                         Who authorized this?

                         Well Janet's not here today and I 
                         want these people out of here.

               The kids quiet down and watch them argue. A CAMERA GUY starts 
               shooting the argument and Dennis sees him.

lies on the floor next to food wrappers, Coke bottles and

garbage, slumped over. But he's not sleeping.
He's surfing the ether. Allowing his sixth sense to
guide him. His hands move down and across the stacks of
newer periodicals, fingers probing the layers of
information.
Left hand suddenly stops.
Hennessey's eyes open. He removes the layers of periodicals
on top of his left hand, leans close. Edges his fingers
away and sees an OBITUARY. A name -- Isabel Dodson.




EXT. L.A. STREETS - EVENING

John walks the streets, numb to the world. A rat
scurries past near the curb. Then another. Several
crows fly by.
Above him is a BILLBOARD - "YOUR TIME IS RUNNING OUT."
Doesn't matter that below it is -- "TO BUY A NEW CHEVY."
The point is crystal clear. John shakes his head, breaks
out laughing which quickly turns into a coughing fit.
He leans to a gutter. Another rat scoots past. John
barely notices. Then a frog jumps past. But it's the
crab crawling by that finally catches John's gaze.

Sweat drips off as he looks up. He opens his palm --
reveals to Angela a simple HOSPITAL BAND. The name
"ISABEL DODSON" is typed on it.
Even as a semi-convert, this news completely floors
Angela. She takes the plastic band -- grips it tight --
tries to hold herself together. The adrenaline and pain
overwhelm. Her knee buckle and she drops to the floor.
John watches, isn't sure how to help. He finally reaches
out a single hand -- slowly rests it on her shoulder.
The contact seems to open a floodgate of emotion and
Angela falls right into his arms. John hasn't been this
close to anyone in a long time. Angela finally composes
herself.

Body drawer slides open -- reveals Isabel. Lying in a
cold, sterile room of death. A Hell of a different type.
Hennessey stares down at her, looks around the room
again, makes sure he's still alone.
He reaches in, rips open the protective plastic and
lowers his hand inside. Places it first on her forehead.
Nothing. Then on her chest. Nothing. Wrist is last.
Hennessey shudders. This is it.
He closes his eyes and opens himself to the void --

John lowers his head, then spots blood stains on one of
Hennessey's hands. He opens the fingers, studies the
fork wound. The blood is already drying over it.
John reaches over to the mess of dishes on the floor and
grabs a melting ice cube.
He pushes it into Hennessey's hand, wiping away the dried
blood. It quickly becomes apparent -- this isn't random
stabbings. This is a shape.
John takes a napkin, lays it on the palm and presses.
Residual blood creates a symbol onto the napkin.
It's the same circular symbol we saw on Isabel's wrist.
John doesn't know what it is, but he knows it's important.

With a loud crowd and 20 huge PIN MACHINES GRINDING AWAY
the noise back here is DEAFENING. But this is Beeman's
home. See the desk, the TV. The fold-away bed.
Beeman is on the phone. There's a conversation but it's
way too noisy to hear. All we see are the emotions on
Beeman's face. No doubt news of Hennessey's death is one
of the biggies.
Beeman quickly reaches for a marker, puts it to paper and
starts drawing -- listening and drawing --
He's finished, hangs up. Stares at the Symbol. That
cabinet with the ancient books now gets his attention.

INT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Standard fare.  Two beds and a T.V.  Chuck's lacing a new
pair of sneakers.  Charles is in the shower.  There is a
knock at the door.  Chuck cracks the door.  It's Charlie.

          We're all going to have to testify.

     He starts to open it, looks at the skeleton and shrugs.

                  So, arrest me.
                         (reading)
                  Here's a piece of good news.
                  Jerry's decided to go to school to
                  get his contractor's license.

     Tossing it aside, he takes a drink, opens another.   The
     words are in crayon -- a child's scrawl.

                  Little Jimmy wants his grandpa to
                  know he lost a tooth.

     The Postman turns the envelope over in his palm. A tiny
     tooth falls out. The Postman considers it. This suddenly
     isn't so amusing. He puts it back in the envelope.

     Shoving mail sacks aside, he climbs in the back.
     Burrowing in, he pulls the sacks back, covering himself
     with a blanket of mail. Getting warmer already, he
     regards the skeleton a beat as the RAIN DRUMS ON the ROOF.

     Wearing the blue uniform, The Postman looks down at the
     fresh grave, realizes a eulogy is in order. He takes off
     the hat, holds it over his chest for a heartfelt moment of
     silence.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  Thanks for being there for me.
                         (raising the flask)
                  Here's to you. I consider my
                  taxes very well spent.

     He swallows the last few drops, then sets the flask down
     as a headstone. What now?

     The Postman looks at the desperate faces -- he'd rather
     get back to his meal -- but this may be the most important
     question of all. He doesn't want to lie.

                                MAN #3
                  That sounds awful cheap.

                                THE POSTMAN
                  The catch is the only currency
                  recognized are silver American
                  coins minted before 1964 and two
                  dollar bills. Look for Thomas
                  Jefferson. Of course, food is
                  always acceptable as barter.

     The moment is split by a SIREN.

himself.

In the b.g., Lynne arranges some vases, then hurries out.
Andy opens a box and pulls out his old Howdy Doody doll.  He

    I went out in my goddamn underwear too.

        WILLIAM
    Get out, Spike.
      (he does)
    I'm so sorry.

        ANNA
    This is such a mess.  I come to you to
    protect myself against more crappy
    gossip and now I'm landed in it all
    over again.  For God's sake, I've got
    a boyfriend.

        WILLIAM
    You do?

  It's a difficult moment -- defining where they stand.

        ANNA
    As far as they're concerned I do.  And
    now tomorrow there'll be pictures of
    you in every newspapers from here to
    Timbuktu.

        WILLIAM
    I know, I know -- but... just -- let's
    stay calm...

        ANNA
    You can stay calm -- it's the perfect
    situation for you -- minimum input,
    maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever
    bump into will know.  'Well done you --
    you slept with that actress -- we've
    seen the pictures.'

        WILLIAM
    That's spectacularly unfair.

        ANNA
    Who knows, it may even help business.
    Buy a boring book about Egypt from the
    guy who screwed Anna Scott.

  She heads out.

    That's not true.  And wait a minute...
    this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just
    laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the
    huge sweep of things, this stuff
    doesn't matter.

    What he's going to say next is -- there
    are people starving in the Sudan.

        WILLIAM
    Well, there are.  And we don't need to
    go anywhere near that far.  My best
    friend slipped -- she slipped down-
    stairs, cracked her back and she's in a
    wheelchair for the rest of her life.
    All I'm asking for is a normal amount
    of perspective.

        ANNA
    You're right: of course, you're right.
    It's just that I've dealt with this
    garbage for ten years now -- you've had
    it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives
    are different.

        WILLIAM
    I mean -- today's newspapers will be
    lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.

        ANNA
    Excuse me?

        WILLIAM
    Well, you know -- it's just one day.
    Today's papers will all have been
    thrown away tomorrow.

        ANNA
    You really don't get it.  This story
    gets filed.  Every time anyone writes
    anything about me -- they'll dig up
    these photos.  Newspapers last forever.
    I'll regret this forever.

  He takes this in.  That's the end.

        WILLIAM
    Right.  Fine.  I will do the opposite,
    if it's all right by you -- and always be
    glad you came.  But you're right -- you
    probably better go.

  She looks at him.  The doorbell goes again.  She opens the door.
  Massive noise and photos.  Outside are her people, including
  Karen, a chauffeur, two bodyguards.  And then the door is shut
  and they're all gone.  Silence.

    His name is Thacker.

    Thanks.  I just wondered if Mr. Thacker
    realized he'd been a daft prick and got
    down on his knees and begged you to
    reconsider, whether you would...
    reconsider.

  to Anna.

    Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.

    That's very good news.  The readers of

    Yes -- Anna -- how long are you
    intending to stay here in Britain?

  Pause.  Anna looks up at William.  He nods.

        ANNA
    Indefinitely.

  They both smile -- suddenly the press gets what's going on --
  music -- noise -- they all turn and flash, flash, flash photos
  of William.  Max and Bella kiss.  Bernie kisses a total stranger.

               Clarice, in a combat stance, and wearing a sound-muffling

               A MOVING TARGET

               The silhouette of a man, approaching along a track. Her shots, 
               tightly grouped, are all finding the center chest. The target 
               stops, quite close to her, still swaying.

               Clarice stares at it, deftly working her speedloader. Then 
               she puts a final, emphatic shot right through THE FIGURE'S

               Horrors in Cannibal Trial"), dated 1980.

               Clarice is punching keys on the terminal. Other trainees 
               study at nearby tables.

               She pauses, jotting a note on her pad, as Ardelia comes by,

Emerging from his car with some papers, Dr. Kaufman is ambushed

Sayer has to hurry to keep up with his supervisor as he heads
toward the hospital.
                     KAUFMAN
           We all believed in the "miracle"
           of Cortisone until our patients
           went psychotic on it. Now it's
           L-Dopa.
He hands over the papers - xeroxed articles from medical
journals and newspapers which Sayer gave him to read - and
keeps going, Sayer straggling a few steps back.
                     SAYER
           With all due respect, I think it's
           rather too soon to say that.

           With all due "respect," it's
           rather way too soon. Let the
           chemists do the damage.
The gap between them widens as Sayer slows. He expected this
sort of reaction from Kaufman, but had hoped for another.
Kaufman disappears into the building.

               Well, the good thing is that it's
               all over now. Principal Barnes will
               think you're a martyr for losing a

               You lied. To your boss -- and a

	His smile is one of anticipation. He nods to a PAL without 
	stopping; eyes a COUPLE OF CHICKS dancing on the street, but is 
	not dissuaded.
 
6	INT. BARBER SHOP - DAY 

	Shorty has his jacket and hat off, his sleeves rolled up. He is like a 
	surgeon preparing for an operation. His equipment is spread out on 
	a table: can of lye, large mason jar, wooden stirring spoon, knife, 
	the eggs. His actions have the character of a ritual: each thing 
	being done just so, in time-honored fashion.

	He slices the potatoes and drops the thin slices into the mason jar.
	He adds water and makes a paste of the starch.

	Behind Shorty is a spirited barbershop conversation. ONE MAN is
 	getting a haircut; TWO OTHERS are watching (TOOMER, JASON)
	one of them from behind a newspaper. A middle-aged barber, 
	CHOLLY, is doing most of the talking.

	ANGLE - Shorty pries open the can of lye, whiffs it. It's good and 
	strong. He pours some in the mason jar, stirring with the wooden 
	spoon. He cracks the eggs into the mixture and stirs. He waits as 
	fumes rise and feels the outside of the jar as it gets hot.

          and shepherd the kids, keeping them on their best behavior --
                         
          -- for the PHOTOGRAPHERS shooting this family gathering.
          Seeing the photographers makes this feel staged.
                         
          Mandela looks past the photographers, sees his daughter
          ZINDZI glancing in from the doorway, and then moving on.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Excuse me.
                         
          Mandela disentangles the babies, stands, leaves.

          PHOTO OF MANDELA AND PIENAAR SHAKING HANDS.
                         
          She is a modern, cosmopolitan young woman.
                         
          When Mandela enters, Zindzi looks up from the newspaper with
          a very Mandela-like grunt.

                          ZINDZI
           It doesn't matter what I think.

Spacious, lofty.     Costa and Grace enter.

             Careful.
Costa scoots aside a pile of clothing.       The newspapers.
Cool art, sketches, images all over the walls.
Reminiscent of Grace's hotel room. And a very cool view
of downtown.
Grace taking everything in. Art books, sketch pads.
Piled high on the desk. She looks at the ceiling. SEES
notes and sketches taped up. Grace laughs to herself.

                           COSTA

             I'm sorry. It's a sty.    Must be a
             profiling mother lode.

                           GRACE

             I'm done profiling you.   I got you
             figured out.

Grace looking at a drawing on the wall.       Costa winces, he

1   EXT. A STREET NEAR BRICK LANE - EVENING                       1

    It's 5.30pm in late December and rain is pouring. The
    scant Christmas decorations are hanging limp in the rain.
    A young Turk (EKREM) runs through the rain with a Turkish
    newspaper held over his head. He ducks into a traditional
    barber's shop called Ozim's.

2   INT. OZIM'S BARBER SHOP - EVENING                             2

    The shutters are drawn. OZIM (a plump middle-aged Turk)
    is cutting the hair of the last customer of the day (SOYKA).
    Soyka is a Chechen, well-groomed, wearing a sharp suit
    beneath the barber's gown.

    During the conversation we glimpse distinctive eagle- and
    star-shaped tattoos on Soyka's arms and hands.

    Ozim and Soyka are chatting as Ekrem enters.   Soyka speaks
    with a Russian accent.

                           OZIM
              Guvenilmez... daginik... bloody
              kids, you know... he says - `but
              Amca it's Christmas?... Christmas!
              We're Islam!

                          SOYKA
              Oi, how much are you taking off?

                          OZIM
              Christmas! So I said to him...
              alisverise cimac. The kid's
              sixteen...

    Ozim brushes some hair off the customer's shoulder and
    Ozim finally acknowledges Ekrem, who is shivering and wet
    near to the door. Ekrem turns the `Open' sign to `Closed'.

               My dad swapped a little Georgian
               girl for this stuff.

     Nikolai sits down on a crate, rests his head against the
     wall. Kirill joins him and swigs some more.

               more what he's like. Here, drink

     Nikolai decides to bite the bullet, get this news over
     with.

                              NIKOLAI
                  He offered me stars. I accepted
                  them.

     A long pause. This is what Kirill wanted, but now it feels
     like a stab in the back. Finally Kirill swallows a huge
     swig of brandy then turns awkwardly to hug Nikolai. He
     squeezes him hard for a long time then shoves him away.

                               KIRILL
                      (lying))
                  You think I didn't know already?
                  He told me before. It was my fucking
                  idea. He said there are a lot of
                  things I have to teach you.

     Nikolai nods.    Kirill gets to his feet....

                              KIRILL (CONT'D)
                  Some stuff will take a long time.

     thin hospital gown beneath it.

     He reveals the eight-pointed star tattoos on his chest and
     Yuri reacts with absolute astonishment.

     Nikolai too suddenly seems almost ashamed that he has got
     this far. After a long silence Nikolai mumbles.

   Jones unceremoniously pushes past Silus and moves into

If you're around you should drop by and

Okay, maybe I will.

He exits the room. As he does we see a television broadcasting the Sweet case.

update.

TABITHA SOREN
Today in the Sam Sweet case the
prosecution played the 911 call that Sam
Sweet made the night he murdered his
brother. Keep in mind, he confessed one
month later.

The courtroom listens to a 911 phone call. The transcription is seen on the screen.

SAM SWEET V ON THE TAPE
(crying and babbling)
Hello, please send help. My twin brother
has been shot.

911 OPERATOR
Slow down sir. What happened?

SAM SWEET
Oh my god, they shot him with a shot gun
four times. I mean I think it was a
shotgun. Who would do such a thing?! I
think it was an Asian gang or something.
They were speaking some other language.

Sam leans over and whispers something in his lawyer's ear.

The Sam Sweet trial has been thrown into

month after the killing. In this "Hard
Copy" exclusive an apparently intoxicated
Sam Sweet puts on a macabre show for his
friends at a party. The judge has not
decided whether this tape is admissible
as evidence.

We see a videotape of Sam Sweet at a party. The date and time are seen in the corner. Sam stands 
next to the corner of a wall which is completely covered with a mirror. Sam gestures with a beer 
bottle as he looks at his reflection in the mirror.

SAM SWEET
(to camera)
Hey everyone. Look it's me and�
(gestures to his reflection)
my brother Stan.
(waves at reflection)
Hi Stan. It's so nice to see you. How
are you feeling?
(to camera)
Look, he's alive.

Sam punches the mirror, shattering it.

SAM SWEET
(angry)
Now he's dead.

Realizing he's revealed too much, he forces a smile.

it a gun. He starts to sweat. Jaye P. Morgan is saying
something about Big Nose. But we can't understand it. The
audience laughs. Barris continues to scan the audience.
Someone in headphones signals Barris from behind a camera.

                       BARRIS (CONT'D)
                 (to Big Nose)
             Well, win a few, lose a few.
                 (to audience)
             We'll be back with more stuff... right
             after this message.

Barris waits on his mark for the taping to again begin. He
watches the commotion around him with eagle eyes: technicians
and stagehands running around, the audience chanting "Chuckie
Baby", the celebrity panel joking with each other, the guys
in the booth smoking, the guys in the band laughing. Barris
turns around and around on his mark, trying to catch every
movement, looking for a gun, a suspicious character. The
chanting continues, louder and more distorted. The faces in
the audience turn grotesque. Barris sweats profusely, his
breathing becomes more and more shallow. Suddenly his eyes
roll back in his head and he drops to the stage floor,
unconscious.

          I met with Prince Thamer at the
          Saudi embassy fifteen minutes after
          I heard this morning's news. After
          speaking with Thamer, I advised we
          withhold additional US personnel
          because a big part of the religious
          justification for these bombs is
          the presence of current US
          personnel. More boots on Saudi soil
          make an already combustible
          situation more so. I know that's
          not the answer you want, but...

Motions to Maricella: the floor is yours.

          My two cents: The Saudis haven't
          asked for FBI help. Sounds like
          they've done just the opposite. If
          we force the issue, that could

           Walter looks after her then turns his collar up against the
          chill. It is late winter. The trees are bare -- black
          silhouettes against the darkening sky.
          
          Walter turns towards the shelter for protection from the
          wind. Filling the kiosk, a clothing advertisement displays a
          young girl striking a seductive pose.
          
          INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY
          
          CLOSE on a police file. A mug shot reveals Walter, many years
          younger. Pages are flipped through giving glimpses of newspaper
          clippings as well as typed documents. Words stand out --
          "Convicted, 1st degree --," "3 counts --," "served --."
          
          A plain clothes officer closes the folder and looks out his
          office window where Walter stands being fingerprinted. This
          is Sergeant LUCAS, mid-fifties, face creased and greying
          hair.

                  No one wants it to be. It's like
                  saying why not make bullfighting
                  safer? It's a blood sport. The risk of
                  death turns people on. Without it, I
                  guess, it'd be half the fun. Which is

     SUZY from a tabloid newspaper. She's clearly the most famous

                  What was the description?

                            SUZY
                  Mostly positive in terms of
                  appearance. Negative only in terms of

              I got it free with the tune-up.

     Looking over Truman's shoulder, she notices a small uncut patch
     of grass, missed by Truman in one of his passes.

                           MERYL
              You missed a section.

     Meryl enters the house.  Truman restarts the lawnmower and
     obediantly pushes it towards the offending patch of lawn.  As
     the mower brushes up against the unconforming blades of grass,
     Truman pulls back abruptly.  He checks the kitchen window for
     Meryl and wheels the mower away, leaving the patch uncut.

              One of the keys kept sticking.

     Truman picks up Meryl's newspaper and skims idly through it.  He
     notes an article headlined, "SLAYING TRIAL ENTERS SIXTH WEEK".

     begins his trek to work, accompanied by the cued rush hour
     traffic.

                           CHRISTOF
              I bet he doesn't stop at the newstand.

     As predicted, Truman walks by, barely glancing at a newspaper's
     banner headline, "NUCLEAR POWER PLANT REOPENED".  Christof scans
     the shot options available to him on the video wall.

                           CHRISTOF
              ...Bodycam Two...

     The large On-Air Monitor cuts to Truman, via the point-of-view
     of an approaching PEDESTRIAN.  For an instant, the unaware
     Truman looks directly into the lens of the disguised camera.

     Truman is immediately picked up by a hidden camera inside
     the building where he exchanges a half-hearted greeting with an

          Thank you, Matthew. Yeah, I agree. Only

          OK: That's a valid point. Just because

          it doesn't mean he personally agrees with
          it. Yes: David?

          Yeah, maybe Shakespeare isn't saying the
          gods don't care about us. Maybe he's saying
          there's a higher consciousness that we
          can't see. That the gods' perception of
          reality is so much more developed than ours

          this is a very serious matter, and
          it merits your fullest attention.

                            MARK
                  It's work that's totally unnecessary.
                  You don't have to do anything.
                  Nobody's forcing you to clean and buy a
                  new outfit and think of some goddamn
                  theme cocktail. We can just invite
                  people over last minute and drink

                  more fun that way, anyway.

     As they continue their argument, Matt is struck by the
     pettiness of everyday life. He at once pities it, is
     impatient with it, and longs for it.

              EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - NIGHT                             9

              A mouse-level shot of the spectacular city that never sleeps.
              It's oddly hypnotic. Still. Until...
              - BAM! A pair of sneakers land barely in front of the camera,
              tearing off into the distance.

                                  NYPD #1 (O.S.)

                        FREEEZE! STOP OR WE'LL SHOOT!
              Shoes belong to a panicked MUGGER, early 20's, as THREE NYPD
              OFFICERS clamor after him. The Mugger is a jackrabbit -
              hopping newspaper machines, rolling under passing trucks and
              doing anything he can to avoid arrest.
               ventually the NYPD peter out. The mugger looks back. Smiles.

                                  MUGGER
                        Heh, heh... suckers.
              ON MUGGER - His eyes suddenly go wide as - VROOOOOM! - we see
              a jet-black tweaked out motorcycle fly over the cops' heads,
              aiming directly for Mugger!

                                   MUGGER
                        Whaaa!!!
              The Mugger runs, but can't escape. The Driver is dressed in
              all-black motorcycle leathers and black-visored helmet. Scary
              and faceless. He quickly gains on the Mugger and GRABS him by
              the collar in mid-stride!

                                  MUGGER
                        You crazy?! Put me down, man!
              But Driver doesn't. Instead, he holds him lower without
              stopping the bike... and proceeds to plow Mugger's head into
              every trash can and garbage bin along 9th Avenue!

               `THE NIGHTWATCHER' FOR QUESTIONING". "WHO IS THE

               NIGHTWATCHER?"
               WIDER - A quieter area of the city. Broken by the squealing
               of the bike as Driver (Nightwatcher) roars in to a stop.
               Nightwatcher drives underneath a TRAIN BRIDGE. He takes off
               his helmet. Red cloth spills out. He turns around as we see-

               - RAPHAEL, THE RED-MASKED NINJA TURTLE!
               He reaches back and pulls out the KNIFE from his SHELL. Looks
               at it, shaking his head and grinning. He sheathes it.

                         In Calcutta it's like civil war. The 
                         Muslims rose and there was a 
                         bloodbath, and now the Hindus are 
                         taking revenge -- and if we can't 
                         stop it there'll be no hope for the 
                         Hindus left in Pakistan.

     Clay hoses the crumbs of grass off his arms.  He dries his
     hands and arms with his hat, then wads it up and stuffs it
     into his shirt to wipe out his armpits.

     Whale sits on a daybed, next to a pile of newspapers.  He
     gestures at a wooden armchair across from him.

     He lifts a drop cloth off a footlocker, revealing a stack
     of "Physique" magazines.  Whale casually covers them with a
     newspaper.

                    We could wrap this like a toga
                    around your shoulders.  Would that
                    help you overcome your schoolgirl

                    All right already.  I'll take it
                    off.  Kind of warm in here anyway.

     He unbuttons the shirt and pulls it off.

                    Yes.  Much better.
                         (steps forward)
                    Here.

     Clay adjusts his belt buckle as Whale hangs the shirt on a
     wall peg.  He moves back to the easel again.

                                     WHALE
                    I think we'll have you sit slightly
                    sideways, so you can rest one arm
                    on the back of the chair.  Yes.

          Paddy climbs the stairs with a POSTER BOARD tucked under his
          arm and a cup of coffee in his hands. He enters Tommy's room,
          which is also a monument to the past. Old wrestling TROPHIES,
          Steelers' posters, and an EMPTY SECOND BED that obviously
          once belonged to Brendan.

           doodle-doo.
                         
          Paddy places the cup of coffee on the night stand as Tommy
          stirs, then sits on the empty bed and unrolls the poster.
          It's yellowed with age and covered with a boy's handwriting.

          outside his Olds, leaning on the passenger door.
                         
          Brendan carries a gym bag and wears work out clothes. He's
          clearly not happy to see Paddy, who stands there,

		About two.
 
	INTERIOR. THE BEDROOM 
	Charlie standing by the window, is picking up his keys, a 
	few dollar bills, a comb, etc., from a chair and putting 
	them into his trouser pockets. The blinds of the bedroom 
	window have been opened, and the high August sun streams in, 
	whitening Charlie's face. After he has pocketed his odds and 
	ends, he moves to the chest of drawers on which, among all 
	sorts of other things, there are several textbooks and an 
	opened notebook. He stands a moment looking down into the 
	open notebook, his lips moving ever so little, as he commits 
	some of his notes to memory. He turns a page of the notebook 
	back to check something and then goes back to the previous 
	page. Now he opens one of the smaller drawers in the chest 
	of drawers. The drawer contains wisps of his wife's stockings 
	and other feminine things. He finds a small roll of bills and 
	takes one of them, putting the bill in his pocket and closing 
	the dresser drawer. 

				CHARLIE
		I'm taking five bucks from your 
		drawer. 

	He pauses now to affix a less frowning expression onto his 
	face and goes out into the little foyer and into the dining 
	area.

	INTERIOR. THE DINING AREA
	Helen is seated at the dinette table, sipping coffee and 
	reading yesterday's newspaper. There are two cups of coffee 
	on the table.

	The two young husbands look down again at their hands and

	girl standing in front of him, and then lets his attention 
	drift down the length of the car.
 
				KENNETH
		Hey, there's a guy down there, 
		trying to pick up a girl down there.
 
	He is referring to a Young Fellow who elbowed his way down 
	through the crowded aisle but who stopped abruptly when he 
	noticed an attractive girl, seated about three seats down 
	from Kenneth. The Girl is reading a newspaper. The Young 
	Fellow stares at her. The Girl, aware of this sudden 
	attention, looks briefly up from her newspaper. The Young 
	Fellow smiles pleasantly. The Girl, with a show of 
	annoyance, looks back to her newspaper.
 
				KENNETH
		Were you with us about eight years 
		ago when I picked up that chick in 
		front of the bus stop in Paterson, 
		New Jersey?
 
				CHARLIE
		When was this?
Title: Bachelor Party, The

		Neither do I. I thought I was 
		through with it. The plan was for me 
		to quit work and go to college full 
		time and cram through in a year or 
		so. But now we got this kid coming, 
		and Helen's going to have to quit 
		her job, and that sets me back where 
		I started from. Another five years 
		of this, summers included.
 
				KENNETH
		I couldn't do it, man, I'll tell you 
		that. I wish I could, but I couldn't.
 
				CHARLIE
		Oh, what am I griping about? This is 
		the life I picked out for myself. 
		But it's a grind, boy, I tell you. 

	They sit silently again. The train hurtles along and then 
	suddenly slows as it approaches a stop. There is a rustle of 
	movement among the passengers in the subway car. A few 
	people start edging toward the doors. The Girl reading the 
	newspaper now folds her newspaper and stands almost directly 
	in the Young Fellow's face. They regard each other.

		Excuse me, can you tell me how to 
		get to the Nassau Street exit?

		Well ... well, at the top of the

	in the bar is a worn, battered old veteran of the streets, a 
	woman in her forties, bespectacled, who is perched on a bar 
	stool at the far end of the bar, gloomily reading a 
	newspaper. CAMERA MOVES DOWN and IN on Charlie, Eddie, and

		six times. He's only having a fair

		kid. I'm going to take you home.
 
	Arnold manages, with Charlie's arm, to get out of the booth 
	and stand. Charlie's firm arm holds him, and they start for 
	the exit. Eddie watches the two figures making their way 
	down the length of the bar to the door. They exit. The door

          To answer mildly, for they are prepared
          With accusations, as I hear, more strong
          Than are upon you yet.

                         CORIOLANUS
          The word is "mildly." Pray you, let us
          go.
          Let them accuse me by invention, I
          Will answer in mine honor.

                         MENENIUS
          Ay, but mildly.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!
          Coriolanus steels himself as they emerge from between the
          stands and head toward the set.
          TV news crews are waiting. Blinding lights snap on.
          The crowd, on seeing Coriolanus, lets out a ROAR. Deafening
          and savage.
          We see Cassius and Tamora moving through the crowd,
          instigating, convincing, imploring.
          Coriolanus ignores it all. Imperious to the end.
          Brutus and Sicinius wait on the set.

                         BRUTUS
          (whispers to Sicinius)
          Put him to choler straight.
          Coriolanus and his supporters move to the stage. Coriolanus
          glares at the Tribunes. The TV crews take up position.
          Menenius gestures for Coriolanus to step to the microphone,
          whispering to him:

                         MENENIUS
          Calmly, I do beseech you.
          Coriolanus steps to the microphone.
          Brutus gestures for the crowd to quiet down.
          We see bits of this scene through the monitors on the TV
          cameras.
          When the crowd is silent, Coriolanus begins to make a

                         REHEARSED SPEECH:

          Caius Martius was
          A worthy officer in the war, but
          insolent,
          Overcome with pride, ambitious past all

          And Rome sits safe and still without him.
          They are distracted when people begin talking loudly,
          alarmed, at the bar. They hush each other and watch the TV
          over the bar. Something has happened.
          On the TV: a SPECIAL REPORT. Breaking News. A scroll across
          the bottom of the screen reads "The Volscians On The March?"

          The whole bar is growing quiet now. All watching the TV,
          which shows grainy indistinct images -- like cell phone
          pictures -- of troops and tanks.

            Frankly, yes, to my surprise.  He
            thinks he's very gifted - those

Susan says nothing.  Sidney, watching her closely, probes
further:

            You feel pretty strong about this

cannot see the watchfulness in his face.  Sidney prompts
again:

The news has considerable impact on him.  But he hides it,
saying lightly:

                         SIDNEY
            Well, congratulations.  But don't
            go just for the ride!  Or didn't

A pause.  Each is concerned with private thoughts.  Susan,
relaxed, adds quietly:

                         SUSAN
                   (softly)
            It's given me a big lift to know

            brother's sister.

Kello laughs, releases the grip; Hunsecker strolls past him
stoops to lean into the car listening to the police calls on

The THREE SHOT favoring Bartha and Sidney.  Both Sidney and
Bartha are now aware of Mrs. Bartha's curiosity.

                   (fractional pause)
            He likes to use the real names...

A moment of chill silence.  Then Bartha gets to his feet,
signals for a waiter.  As Sidney rises also:

                         WIFE
            Where are we running?  What am I
            missing here?

            Waiter, the check.

            This man is trying to hold a gun to

She quickly studies her newspaper again.  As quickly, Bartha
leans across the table and snatches it out of her hands.  In
doing so, he upsets the glass of champagne, which contains
only a few drops.

SIDNEY AND BARTHA

Bartha turns challengingly to Sidney.

                         BARTHA

He discards the paper with a show of disinterest.  Mary
picks it up again.

                         MARY
                   (looking at The

            If this is true, J.J.'s going to
            hit the ceiling...

Sidney moves around behind Mary.  His eyes are fixed on a
spike which sits on Mary's desk.  On it is impaled a proof
of Hunsecker's column.  Meanwhile, he remarks:

                         SIDNEY
            Can it be news to you that J.J.'s
            ceiling needs a plaster job every
            six weeks?

INSERT

From Sidney's viewpoint, Hunsecker's column.  The shot is
just too distant for us to be able to read the print.

SIDNEY AND MARY

Sidney is looking at the column.  Mary is concentrated on
papers before her.  Without looking up, she is clearly aware
of Sidney's efforts to read the proof.

                         MARY
                   (quietly)
            Sidney, you know that J.J. doesn't
            like people to look at the column
            proof in advance...

Sidney, caught "in flagrante", laughs.

                         SIDNEY
            Mary, I'm not "people" - there's
            Falco blood, sweat and tears in
            that column.

He turns away, changing the subject (apparently).

            this time of year.

Smiling, Nikko leaves.  Hunsecker picks up a pencil and
makes a note on a pad, about birds no doubt.  Abruptly he
looks up, calling:

She has been trying to pass unnoticed to her room.  She
comes forward to him; her manner is serious and wary.  His
act is one of a tasteful Mammy singer, but he is watchful,
too.

            Yes, he phoned.  I don't know this

            charges?

She shakes her head.

INT. LIVING ROOM

CAMERA SHOOTS towards the closed door of Susan's room.
Hunsecker walks into the shot, stops before the door.  He
begins to take off his tie and unbutton his shirt, clearly
preparing to go to bed.  As an after-thought, he comes back
to the door, addresses it:

                         HUNSECKER
                   (gently)
            Susie?
                   (getting no answer)
            Are you in bed...?

CAMERA MOVES CLOSER.  It is at a low level, still emphasizing
the man's dignity.  He strolls for a few paces.

                         HUNSECKER
                   (continuing)
            I don't have to tell you, of
            course, that I cleared your
            boyfriend's name; I didn't let you
            down...

CAMERA has now moved so that we are shooting past Hunsecker
onto Susan's door.  He gets no answer except silence.

HUNSECKER

A CLOSE SHOT, REVERSE ANGLE.  We now see in his face a
flicker of fear.  With what is clearly an effort, he
reassumes a confident manner.

                         HUNSECKER
            ...I was saving this news for
            breakfast, but I think I'll jump
            the gun!  I'M GONNA GIVE YOU AND
            DALLAS THE BIGGEST WEDDING THIS
            TOWN HAS EVER SEEN!

Still no answer from inside the bedroom.  Hunsecker's forced
expression remains unnaturally fixed upon his face.  He
calls out:

                         HUNSECKER
            Susie...?

INT. BEDROOM

The room is quite empty.  CAMERA SHOOTS across the bed
towards the door in background.  Susan's discarded fur coat
lies on the bed.  And the doors of the wardrobe are open.

Sick Boy is silent. He stiffens as he avoids Renton's gaze. They shift

     I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what
     they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the
     punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not
     exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it
     here.' Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get
     into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts,
     get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?

     And I'll tell you why. Because I'm fed up to my back teeth with

     getting on with life. What are you doing?

       Riding in the opposite direction, is WESSEX. And what a

       Here is a man who has heard wonderful news. He sees VIOLA

          Margaret sits hunched over with a blanket wrapped around her.
          Richard drives the boat.   They don't talk.

          Richard and Margaret walk towards the house, which looms above
          them as they prepare to deliver the news that they aren't getting
          married.   The front door opens, and Geoffrey comes outside in a
          hurry.   He's clearly been waiting.

          GEOFFREY
          Come with me.

          RICHARD
          Where's mom, dad?   We all need to talk.

          GEOFFREY
          Not now.   C'mon.
          Richard and Margaret look at each other, not sure what to do.

          Richard, Margaret and Geoffrey arrive at the door to the

          Margaret nods, hands Richard the bouquet, and confidently walks
          back up the aisle with all eyes on her.   She stops when she gets
          to Gertrude and leans down.

          Uh-huh.   Yeah.   That's great Frank.   Good

          Margaret hangs up.

          So Frank's back in?
          Margaret nods distractedly.   Getting Frank to do the publicity

          The two of them come together down the corridor. They stop at
          the open door of the cell. The body has been removed. The
          books are still on the floor. MICHAEL goes in. A bare table,
          a chair, a bed, a closet, a toilet in the corner behind the
          door. There are shelves with books, an alarm clock, a stuffed
          bear, two mugs, instant coffee, tea tins.

                    She didn't pack. She never intended
                    to leave.
          
          MS BRENNER looks at him in confirmation. MICHAEL looks at the
          two lower shelves on which are ranged the tapes with the
          cassette machine.
          
          Above the bed are a series of cuttings, pictures torn from
          magazines, showing meadows, hillsides, pasture, cherry trees.
          One in particular : a burst of autumnal colours. MICHAEL
          kneels on the bed to look at them. There are quotations,
          articles, recipes, even sayings in HANNA'S childish
          handwriting : `Spring lets its blue banner flutter through
          the air' is one. Then he sees a newspaper photograph : the
          young MICHAEL BERG receiving a prize from the school
          principal. The headline `Michael Berg receives school
          literature prize.'
          
          MS BRENNER reaches out for a tea tin from the shelf. Then she
          sits next to MICHAEL on the bed, and takes out a folded sheet

                         MIKE WALLACE (OVER)
               What "Seven Dwarfs?"

                         LOWELL (OVER)
               The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... Referred
               to this...  Said they <u>should</u> be afraid of
               him...  I assume, afraid of what he could
               reveal.
                   (to Staff Lawyers)
               Now, you tell me.  What does this guy
               have to say that threatens these people?

     And, now, we see Lowell, Mike Wallace and Debbie DeLuca with
     two staff Lawyers, MARK STERN and JOHN HARRIS, sitting around
     a workstation used as an improvised eating area.

     Beyond them are the "60 MINUTES" offices, workstations, piles
     of material, television monitors hanging from the ceiling,
     all tuned to CBS programming...

                   (re:  video)
               What that is is tobacco's standard
               defense.  It's the "we don't know"
               litany:  "Addiction?  We <u>believe</u> not.
               Disease?  We don't know.  We take a bunch
               of leaves, roll 'em together.  You smoke

     Lowell's reaction.  Jeffrey's statements are stunning and
     powerful revelations...and dangerous ones to make.

                         LOWELL
               I think what we're trying to tell you is
               that it happens all the time.  This is a
               news organization.  People are always
               telling us things they shouldn't.  We
               have to verify if it's true and in the
               public interest...  And if it is, we air
               it.

                         MIKE WALLACE
               After we corroborate it.  That's why

                         HELEN CAPERELLI
               But one we have to check on, Mike.  I've
               retained outside counsel to do exactly
               that.  On a segment, I might add, that's

     superiors, OVERMEYERS and THOMPSON, a purposeful looking
     woman in charge and her earnest second.

     The two talk RAPIDLY and trade off like a tag team. At
     times their tone can be almost bizarrely whimsical.

     Overmeyers and Thompson seem to have known Sam for a while,
     but even so, there is a practised casualness to the
     repartee. It's a professional friendliness on Overmeyers
     part, no more and for Thompson it's merely an eagerness to
     be involved.

Sam 1 tilts his head, a smile twitches on his face.

                     SAM 1
           Eve?

Sam 1 can't believe it. She's beautiful. She's beautiful.

                                                                   72.



                     EVE BELL
           Yes?

A moment. Eve looking more closely, trying to decipher Sam
1's face. Tears glistening in his eyes.

HERBERT 
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?

HONORA 
playfully shoves his hand away.

HONORA

          A couple of things for you to sign

          And this is your resignation. It's

          ever really hits the fan, we'd have

          and I don't rule out the possibility
          at all -- that fact will be brought
          to light in open hearings before a-

          in the works right this minute, and

          Tony has turned off the television set with a remote
          control switch, having heard the. sound of a key in
          the front door. He rises and turns as Elizabeth enters
          carrying a paper bag.

          Listen, I --
          He breaks off as Elizabeth's face goes pale with shock
          and she drops the bag on the floor. A couple of oranges
          roll across the rug as:

                         TONY
          I'm sorry, I had to talk to you
          She looks at him her expression almost readable as anger;

     Rose turns into the trailer park, heads past a row of

     Rose and Norah open the door and the rancid sweet smell of
     decayed flesh splashes them in the face. They lift their T-
     shirts up over their noses and walk inside.

     Old newspapers stacked to the ceiling. Piles of trash lean
     like snowdrifts against the wall. Cat food encrusted plates.

     Norah opens the bedroom door and peeks in. Flies BUZZ. She
     darts to another room and retches.

                            ROSE
                  Great, now we're gonna have to

     of antiques and things that are simply old.

     Yellow sticky notes cling to doors, walls, light switches,

                       I had just gotten out of college!
                       I was fearless! I went after
                       accounts I had avoided for years
                       because I thought they were out of
                       my league. I spoke to presidents,
                       vice presidents, business managers,
                       sales reps. I was amazing. I was
                       magic. But when I came home to
                       share the news with your mother, I
                       discovered her asleep. When I
                       looked around the house, I realized
                       that her "office", for lack of a
                       better word, was also piled up.
                       So, I took to the house. I have
                       made it my duty to clean this place
                       from top to bottom. Even if it

Through the crack in the door behind which he is hidden,

canaries are being transferred into it.

We MOVE IN CLOSE on the small cage, and see the soiled
newspaper spread on the bottom. The masthead reads:

He closes the doors of the cages, picks up the small
cage. His companion indicates the letter in the woman's
lap.

Footsteps are heard hurrying up the stairs, and after a
moment there is a knock on the door. Watson approaches

short, nervous man whose features are sharper than his

          A NEWSPAPER on the makeup table. Angier sits at the mirror.
          He hubs BROWN PASTE into his hair and then combs it out.
          Then he chooses a beard, seats it on his chin and begins to
          adjust it. He drops the BOTTLE of spirit gum as he looks in
          the mirror and sees OLIVIA standing behind him.

            Kidding around... you know, fun.

Betsy looks toward the street, then back at Tom.

            Maybe if you'd try thinking once in
            a while, you'd get somewhere.

            With who?

                         BETSY
            Alright, now. You want to know why
            CBS has the highest ratings? You
            their news is any different from
            NBC, ABC? It's all the same news.
            Same stories. Same order usually.
            What, you thought they had good
            news for people, right? You thought
            that's why people watched CBS? I'll
            tell you why people watch CBS.
            Cronkite. The man. You got it? Not
            the news, not the issues, the man.
            If Walter Cronkite told people to
            eat soap, they'd do it. We are
            selling cars, goddamn it.

Betsy's attention is being distracted by something she sees
across the street. She puts on her glasses and looks out
across the street again.

                                                           15.

            Well, if Cronkite's so great, why
            don't we run him instead?

                         BETSY
            That's the last. The finish. Period.
            Some pople can learn. Some people
            can't. And you wonder why we never

            Well, If he had been Italian, they
            could have been shot off. Sometimes
            the mob does that to teach guys a
            lesson, If they blow a job or
            something.

                         BETSY
            As I said, he isn't Italian.
            Besides, I thought they just killed
            them.

                         TOM
            Don't be naive. They can't kill
            everybody. They have different
            punishments for different things.
            Like, if they kill a stool pidgeon,
            they leave a canary on the body.
            It's symbolic.

                         BETSY
            Why don't they leave a pidgeon
            instead of a canary?

                         TOM
            I don't know. Maybe they don't
            leave a canary. Don't be technical.
            What I'm saying is if this newsstand
            guy's Italian and his fingers are
            gone, maybe he's a thief.

                         BETSY
            First, he's not Italian. Second
            he's not a thief. I noticed the
            fingers when he was getting my
            change - the right change. Two of
            his fingers are missing. Just stubs.
            Like they were blown away. I was
            putting my change in my purse when
            I saw him get out a cigarette. I
            couldn't help watching. I was dying
            to see how he'd light it.

            No, stupid. With the stubs. That's
            the whole point.

                         TOM
            I know that guy. His hand looks
            like a paw. An old Black guy, the
            newsstand at -

                         BETSY
            No, this is young - well, I'm never
            sure how old Black people are -
            but, anyway, he isn't old. That's
            for sure.

                         TOM
            Show me how he did that again.

EXT. ACROSS THE STREET FROM HEADQUARTERS

Travis is striding briskly across Broadway toward the
Palantine Headquarters.

He s dressed the best we have seen him; his pants (not
jeans) are pressed, his boots shined, his hair combed. Under
his Army jacket he wears a freshly laundered shirt and ivy
league tie. He drops his cigarette, steps on it and walks in.

Watching Travis enter Palantine's Headquarters, we are
surprised to realize that Travis is really quite attractive.
His deformities are psychological, not physical. He believes
he is cursed, and therefore he is.

Travis walks briskly into the office, and heads toward
Betsy's desk.  Tom walks over to greet him, but Travis
ignores him.

                         TRAVIS
                   (at Betsy's desk)
            I want to volunteer.

As the CAMERA examines Travis' face more closely, one can
see the hollowness wrought by lack of sleep and sufficient
diet.

                         Hi. Carl Bernstein of the Washington 
                         Post. I was just wondering if you 
                         remember the names of any of the 
                         books that Howard Hunt checked out 
                         on Senator Kennedy.

                         Liddy--you think there's a chance 
                         he'll talk?

                                     DEEP THROAT
                         Talk? Once, at a gathering, he put 
                         his hand over a candle. And he kept 
                         it there. He kept it right in the 
                         flame until his flesh seared. A woman 
                         who was watching asked, "What's the 
                         trick?" And he replied. "The trick 
                         is not minding."

               DEEP THROAT shakes his head, walks off. WOODWARD stands alone 
               now, watching. Now the shadows have the other man. Just his 
               footsteps are audible. WOODWARD stands there... HOLD.

          Silence.

                        Why don't you people let me alone?
                        I'm minding my own business.  You 
                        mind yours.

                        If you'd just let me talk to you 
                        for a little while, Miss Alexander.
                        All I want to ask you...

          Thompson looks at the Captain, who shrugs his shoulders.

                        I'm sorry.  Maybe some other time -

          If he thought he would get a response from Susan, who thinks 
          she is looking at him steelily, he realizes his error.  He 
          nods and walks off, following the Captain out the door.

                                    THE CAPTAIN
                        She's just not talking to anybody 
                        from the newspapers, Mr. Thompson.

          DISSOLVE IN:

          EXT. NEW YORK STREET - VERY EARLY DAWN -

          The picture is mainly occupied by a large building, on the 
          roof of which the lights spell out the word "Enquirer" against 
          the sunrise.  We do not see the street or the first few stories 
          of this building, the windows of which would be certainly 
          illuminated.  What we do see is the floor on which is located 
          the City Room.  Over this scene, newboys are heard selling the 
          Chronicle, their voices growing in volume.

          As the dissolve complete itself, camera moves toward the one 
          lighted window - the window of the Sanctrum.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

          INT. KANE'S OFFICE - VERY EARLY DAWN -

          The newsboys are still heard from the street below - fainter 
          but very insistent.

          Kane's office is gas-lit, of course, as is the rest of the 
          Enquirer building.

          Kane, in his shirt sleeves, stands at the open window looking 
          out.  The bed is already made up.  On it is seated Bernstein, 
          smoking the end of a cigar.  Leland is in a chair.

                                    NEWSBOYS' VOICES

                        CHRONICLE - GET YA!  CHRONICLE!

          Kane, taking a deep breath of the morning air, closes the window 
          and turns to the others.  The voices of the newsboys, naturally, 
          are very much fainter after this.

          squares of light from the windows above them.  One of these 
          disappears as the blind is pulled.  As the dissolve completes 
          itself, the second square of light commences to reduce in size, 
          and then the entire street is cut off by a blind which Leland 
          pulls down, covering the entire frame.

          the world for her to smile at.  She's too grateful to talk.

          Leland takes the newspaper out of his pocket and hands it to 
          her.  She takes it.  We see the headline, not an insert, but 
          it registers.  It reads: "Fraud at Polls."  Emily is looking 
          at the paper with unseeing eyes, and a little smile.

     AS BILLY AND ELYIAS MOVE OUT TO THE YARD
     they/we see a distant GROUP OF MUSLIMS...CHANTING in Muslim
     prayer, using newspapers for prayer mats: "Allahu Akbar,
     Allahu, Aakbar..."

                         ELYIAS
               Muslims. Bad for business...

     Elyias pounds a fist into his hand.

     Billy follows his gaze to a gang of SIX THAI in a nearby
     section of the yard. Predatory, junkie-thin, full tattooed.
     The leader, KENG, face tattooed, holds court.

     POUNDING BAGS (Two on each bag alternating kicks), HAMMERING
     MITTS and PADS, SPARRING and SHADOWBOXING -- a great machine
     of perpetual violence.

     A DESK GUARD sits, reading a newspaper.

     BILLY'S FACE as he edges forward, transfixed. Everything

     The Boxers are aware of him now. They stop training.

Riggan stares into the mirror, in the reflection he catches
sight of a poster from a movie called "Birdman 3". The
superhero, Birdman (a younger Riggan in a bird costume), wings
widely spread, stares directly back at him. A hand written
note on the top of the poster reads: "Thomson, break a wing!
From the boys at Local 1." Riggan tries to calm himself with a
mantra...

We pan away from the TV to see that the waiting room is
filled with newsmen waiting for something to happen. There is

newsmen with a serious expression on his face. We follow him

Jake needs a few seconds to recover. Then he looks at Riggan
who just sits there, in silence.

                    JAKE
          Why aren't you saying anything?
          This is what you wanted wasn't it?

silence. Sylvia steps up and looks Riggan in the eye.

          Is that what it was? An accident?
Riggan just stares at her. His calm, sad eyes peeking through
the bandages. After a moment his gaze moves over her
shoulder. Sylvia turns and we discover Sam standing in the
doorway holding a bouquet of flowers. A bit of awkward
silence, and Sylvia decides to leave them alone.

She kisses Sam on the head and exits. Sam walks the flowers
to Riggan at the bed. She lays them on his chest.

A moment until the smiles turn to gentle laughter. She takes

INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE IN DEXTER.  DAY.

Although the scene begins with a full-screen close-up of a
newspaper clipping with a photo, it is just a blurry-gray,
crowded scene of BLANCHE's capture.  Really impossible to
make anybody out in the crowd.  Camera stays on photo as we
hear voice over of two men talking: a sheriff and his deputy.

                         BILLY
            I was in the bunch that took 'er.
            See here?  Can you make me out?

            Joe Boyd here.

            Sure enough, Billy, is that your
            head there?

Camera pulls away, BILLY, a young deputy--cold, intense,
humorless and square, carefully folds up the clipping and
puts it in his wallet.

                         BILLY
            Still can't figure how we let them
            other two get away.

                   (an older, more
                   genial type)
            Yeah, seems as how nobody can get
            'em somehow.

FADE IN:

EXT. CAR ON THE MOSS FARM.  A DIRT PATH NEAR THE BARN.  DAY.

It is pouring rain, middle of the afternoon, BONNIE and
CLYDE are inside the car, sitting.  They have lived so much
in cars that they tend to still spend much of their time in
it rather than in a room.  There they are themselves.

INT. CAR.

BONNIE is in the back seat, her legs wrapped in a plaid
blanket, writing poetry.  She looks like Elizabeth Barrett
Browning.  With one essential difference--her arm is in a
sling and she is wearing bandages on the shoulder.  CLYDE is
in the front seat, reading a newspaper.  He is also partially
bandaged.  On the dashboard is a box of ginger-snaps which
he eats while he reads.  They look domestic.

                         CLYDE
            Want a ginger-snap, Bonnie?

                                                          111.

            No, hum-umm.
                   (then she realizes
                   his nice gesture and
                   smiles warmly at him)
            But thanks anyway, Clyde.
                   (she takes it all in,
                   her situation, and
                   looks content and cozy)
            It's real nice here, just the two
            of us like this.

INT. POLICE STATION.  DAY.

The manuscript is lying on the police blotter.  HAMER picks
it up and continues reading it.  He reads it in a halting
way:

                         HAMER
            The road gets dimmer and dimmer;
            Sometimes you can hardly see;
            But it's fight man to man,
            And do all you can,
            For they know they can never be
            free.

            From heartbreak some people have
            suffered;
            From weariness some people have
            died;
            But take it all in all,
            Our troubles are small,
            Till we get like Bonnie and Clyde.

Close-up of a newspaper page.  The poem is printed all the
way down the length of one column.  On the sound track,
BONNIE's voice picks up the recitation:

                         BONNIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
            If a policeman is killed in Dallas,
            And they have no clue or guide;
            If they can't find a fiend,
            They just wipe their slate clean
            And hang it on Bonnie and Clyde.

INT. CAR.  CLOSE-UP OF BONNIE.  DAY.

The day is sunny and we see it through the car window.  She
continues reading, but now she reads it directly from the
newspaper:

                         BONNIE
            If they try to act like citizens
            And rent them a nice little flat
            About the third night
            They're invited to fight
            By a sub-gun's rat-tat-tat.

            Some day they'll go down together;
            They'll bury them side by side;
            To few it'll be grief--
            To the law a relief--
            But it's death for Bonnie and Clyde.

          That's all right. Forget it.    I

          Scotch and plain water. A pair.
          Double.

          Only kind of doubles I play.

We see the train come   around the curve. Again this is just
the same angle that we   used for Guy. It comes to a stop in
the foreground and we   see Bruno alight onto the platform.
He looks about him for   a moment and then strolls away in the
direction of the town.    He approaches the row of telephone
booths.

We see Bruno enter the small booth and start to glance through
the telephone directory.

SHOOTING DOWN onto a small seat by a bus stop, we see Bruno
with an open newspaper in front of him. It is held up as he
reads it.

From his viewpoint we   see a typical frame house. The upper
windows are lit as are   the lower ones as well. A woman is
sitting in a rocker on   the front porch.  This is MRS. JOYCE,
Miriam's mother. She    has white hair. A  woman comes along
the street and pauses   as she gets to Mrs. Joyce.

song, to the tune   of the Barber Shop Chord.

LONG SHOT LIVING ROOM FROM GUY'S VIEWPOINT

SENATOR BURTON and BARBARA BURTON are seated near a desk on
the farthest side of the room. Senator Burton is a
distinguished fifty, a man with great pride in tradition,
his family and his career. Barbara, Anne's younger sister,
is a lively seventeen who loves excitement, says exactly
what she thinks and rarely thinks before she says it.
Superficially, in height and figure, she resembles Miriam.
She also weirs glasses. By her gestures we gather she is
speaking urgently, but softly, to her father, who lifts a
weary hand to quiet her as she looks toward Guy in the
hallway, Barbara keeps quiet and also looks toward Guy.
They both wait for him to enter.

Barbara has been squirming in her seat, then as if jet
propelled she catapults out of it and runs to Guy, giving
him a big hug and a smack on the cheek.

                      BARBARA
          Something awful has happened, Guy.

                       SENATOR
              (firmly)
          Sit down, Barbara.

Subdued, she sits down.   But Guy remains standing.

                      SENATOR
              (finding it difficult
               to begin)
          There seems to be no way of
          diplomatically breaking tragic news.
          I'm sorry, Guy, to be the one to
          tell you. It concerns your wife.
          She's been murdered.

Guy stares woodenly at the Senator, is if hypnotized.

                      BARBARA
          The police have been using everything
          but radar to locate you.

                      SENATOR
          You're to call Headquarters at
          Metcalf.

The full impact of what has happened hits Guy once more.

                      GUY
          Miriam...murdered.

                      ANNE
              (with inner tension)
          She was...strangled.

Slowly Guy's eyes meet hers. They are remembering what he
said on the phone: "I could strangle her." He sinks into a
chair. The Senator is quite distressed.

During the following scene Barbara quietly goes about the
business of pouring drinks and serving them. She knows
everyone's preference.

                        GUY
           Yes sir.   Goodnight.

Barbara pokes her head quickly around the door.

                       BARBARA
           I still think it would be wonderful
           to have a man love you so much he'd
           kill for you.

Left alone, Guy and Anne embrace. Anne's nervous tension
comes to the surface in a flood of relief.

                       ANNE
           I told myself over and over I was
           being silly, but there was one
           horrible moment tonight when the
           news came through. I kept remembering

Anne quickly puts her fingers over his mouth.

           Don't even say it.   Forget you ever
           said it. Even more   terrifying than
           the murder itself,  Guy, was the awful
           thought that if you  had anything to
           do with it we'd be  separated, -perhaps
           forever. I'd never   see you again.
           I couldn't bear it.

A knot of people are hanging around the entrance, including

is a murmur from the crowd and we hear Guy's name. He passes
into the entrance.

               That's good because we can use it

               wouldn't have wanted me if I was

               tell me why there's a point in
               sitting my exams, and there's no
               point in me going to University.

               overpaid by a third.

                         To repeat - 39-year-old Martin Luther 
                         King, who preached non-violence and 
                         won the Nobel Peace Prize, was cut 
                         down earlier today by a sniper's

                         of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, 
                         Tennessee.  He was surrounded by his 
                         closest aides.  The police say they 
                         have no suspects at this time.  Mr.

As the Helicopter comes in for a landing, the Bigger Man
kneels next to the Smaller Man, who bleeds from a bullet
wound to the arm.  His face, pale, sweating. The Bigger Man
wipes the Smaller Man's brow and speaks softly and seriously.

INT. ROADHOUSE -- MORNING

A full on shit-kicking dive.     Nearly empty, given the hour.
A TELEVISION plays the morning    news over the bar.  Only two
inhabitants - one a BARTENDER,    the other the lone CUSTOMER,
smoking and picking at a plate    of criminally runny eggs.

                                                           3.

          Tell the truth, Vic. You made these
          with a blender, right?
He grins and we get our first good look at
TOM HARDY - Three day stubble, dark rings around his eyes,
but a with strong jaw and steady voice. Not your average
barfly. Somebody who maybe used to be somebody.
                      BARTENDER
          Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't
          make no damn difference to me.

          Yeah, if you've slept.
                      BARTENDER
          You know the law - no liquor before
          noon. Could lose my license.
                      HARDY
          Don't you mean "don't need no liquor
          license not taken away from me"?
The Bartender smiles.
                      BARTENDER
          Hurricane kept you up, too?
                      HARDY
          Yeah, and I could've used the sleep.
          I'm supposed to meet people here
          tonight, try and get some work going.
He stops, his attention suddenly on the TV.    A NEWSCASTER:
                      NEWSCASTER
          ...is expected to announce the grand
          jury indictments in the Guissepe
          Torres police corruption case as
          early as tomorrow afternoon.
          Speculations abound that up to ten
          former homicide detectives could be
          named in the proceedings-

                                                           4.
The Bartender turns the TV off hastily.   Embarrassed:
                      BARTENDER
          Sorry.
Hardy just looks away. The Bartender puts an empty glass
down and fills it to the lip with bourbon.
Hardy nods a "thank you" and reaches for the glass when the
PAGER on his hip goes off. He checks the number.

          Maybe later. Ray, let me say this
          up front - I'm not a cop.
Dunbar turns away, no longer interested.   Hardy continues:
                      HARDY
          I used to be, but that's beside the
          point. Who I am doesn't really
          matter; what matters is that right
          now, you're in a shitload of trouble.
          You understand that, right?
No response.
                      HARDY
          Now, I don't know if you did what
          you did in self defense and frankly
          I don't really care. I'm just doing
          a favor for Colonel Styles because
          he wants to know if anyone else who's
          still out there is in need of
          assistance. To be honest with you,
          though, I don't care about that
          either.
Dunbar looks up at this, surprised.
                      HARDY
          I don't know those guys, you do.
          They die, to me, it's like seeing a
          couple people died in a fire on the
          news - tragic, but it doesn't affect
          me. The only thing I care about is
          I agreed to do a favor for a friend
          and try and talk to you till your
          transpo shows up. You like baseball?
No response.   Osborne looks at her watch - two minutes.
                      HARDY
          I could talk baseball for   days.
          Batting averages, ERA's, I   got
          statistics in my brain, I   don't know
          how I remember them. It's    freaky.
          You wanna talk baseball?
Dunbar, completely confused.
                      HARDY
          Come on Ray, we're gonna be here
          five hours, we gotta talk about
          something. So who do you like?
A long silence and then:

          INT. A CONFERENCE ROOM (RUTHERFORD STERN)                       - LATE NIGHT

          A wall of glass offers a letter-boxed view of a sleek
          conference room. Amber sconces illuminate an enormous table,
          empty save for &amp; YOUNG MAN at the far end - a lonely figure
          hunched over a laptop.
          Steadily tighten on JONATHAN MESSER (late 20s), trim build
          not entirely at ease in a suit. Likeable features suggest a
          gentle, intelligent demeanor.
          Grids of numbers from the laptop screen reflect off his
          glasses. Tired, he rubs his eyes, continues typing.

          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN LAW OFFICES - LATE NIGHT

          Briefcase in hand, Jonathan walks a vacant corridor of empty
          cubicles. In a few offices lights are still on; the figures
          of YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN at work are blurred like photos out of
          focus behind the frosted-glass of closed doors.

          Waiting for his train, Jonathan pauses at a news kiosk.

          The grizzled OLD MAN behind the counter doesn't look up.

          The Old man grudgingly bends to cut the plastic on a fresh

          Jonathan descends an above-ground subway stop. Neighborhood
          streets are vacant, the clopping of his shoes the only sound.
          Jonathan turns a corner, heads for a humble duplex, the first

	The office is as unadorned and Spartan as that of Cornelius  -- in 
	fact, with minor changes in decor, the same set can be used. There are 
	many thick leatherbound books on this scholar's desk. Zaius is reading

	Taylor stands facing the desk.

			The verdict is in. At the moment your 
			simian friends -- and  sponsors -- are 
			free on bail. But they'll soon be brought 
			to trial for heresy.

	like a freak animal, but addresses him as an imaginative adversary who 
	must be intimidated by the threat of terror.

				TAYLOR
			What about me?

				ZAIUS
				(offhandedly) 
			Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, 
			you performed a service for the State ...
				(smiling) 
			Because your hearing made it possible 
			for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.

			And now the Tribunal has placed you in

      OVER JAMES' PERFORMANCE AT THE GARDEN AS YOUNG BLACK GUYS
      DANCE.

                           JAMES (V.O.)
                In America today you've either got
                to be an entertainer or a ball
                player or what? If you poor, young
                and black, what is there? And you
                ask me why they on the street? It
                ain't politics we watchin'. It's
                economics.

                 By then I'd mastered my craft.  Selling arms
                 is not so different to selling vacuum
                 cleaners.  You advertise, pound the
                 pavement, take orders.

     The businessman's smile dissolves when he catches a glance at the
     brochure lying next to Yuri's "Day-Runner" - glossy photos of
     GRENADE LAUNCHERS.

     A MONTAGE OF SCENES - ILLUSTRATING THE ANATOMY OF AN ARMS DEAL.

     It takes place in an unidentified country in North Africa.

                             YURI (V.O.)
                 Of course, a good arms dealer also has to be
                 a political scientist.  I go by a seven-step
                 approach.

     YURI gets off a plane.

                 Three: Immediately approach the radical

                 after modelling.  Acting, her own cosmetics
                 line.  I didn't sabotage her careers but I
                 can't deny it was convenient for me in
                 maintaining a low profile.  She was a

     At the same time he spies an object in Nicolai's toy box - a toy

                 There are trucks.  You just have to get all
                 that food out of them.

     Yuri gestures down the dock where food is being loaded into trucks
     marked, "HUMANITARIAN AID"

He squeezes the 'disarm' button on his key chain. The car
chirps twice and he opens the door. Bending his knees to get
in, he stops.

There is a section of Newspaper wedged in the steering wheel.

When his brain unlocks he straightens up and moving only the
top of his body, makes a quick recon of the surrounding area
and his back seat.

Nothing threatening seen, he eases into the seat. Slam! The
door is closed and locked.

Gingerly, Mr. Smith removes the Newspaper. It folds open. On

                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
             Are you positive? Because we found
             potter's clay on the carpet of the
             murder house and I was sure you
             said to me that you worked with
             clay, that you made pots.

                       MR. SMITH
             No. I said my hobby was
             photography, not pottery.

                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
             Maybe that was it. The Stewardess
             upstairs said the victims kept
             their curtains open when they made
             love. Could I see some of the
             pictures you took of that Couple?

Mr. Smith can only stare at Detective Atwood. His Adam's
apple moves up and down though he makes no sound. Should he
or shouldn't he?

Finally he throws his arms up in a shrug but in his half-turn
of indecision he happens to spy the Newspaper he tossed at
the passenger seat of his car.

Part of it is draped over the console. The red circles around
the words on that page jump out at him.

                       MR. BROOKS (V.O.)
             Don't - be - stupid -.

Mr. Smith returns his attention to Detective Atwood.

                       MR. SMITH
             You are harassing me, Detective
             Atwood. You know very well I'm not
             a potter and I don't have any
             pictures! So my feeling is that
             your feeling is wrong and that you
             should move your car and let me go
             home.

                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD
             What is your job here? What do you
             do?

INT. KITCHEN � BROOKS HOUSE - MORNING

In his slippers and robe, Mr. Brooks is standing in the
Doorway watching Jane who is leaning over the Counter with an
open Newspaper next to a bowl of cereal.

He has a chance to take a good long look before she feels his
presence and raises her head.

                       JANE
             Oh, Hi, Daddy, I thought you'd
             already be gone.

                       MR. BROOKS
             Roger called. There was another
             murder last night near Stanford.

                       JANE
             Oh...

                       MR. BROOKS
             Done the same way as the one they
             talked to you about. Right down to
             the hatchet being left at the
             scene.

Jane can't quite conceal the tremor of surprise that ripples
through her and Mr. Brooks sees it.

             They think they have a serial

             last night, so you're in the clear.

                       JANE
             That's good news, isn't it? I mean
             even if you're innocent it's good
             news to know you're not a suspect.

Looking up. Mr. Smith's body is rolled over the edge. It
falls on top of us.

                                                       123.



EXT. CEMETERY � NIGHT

Mr. Brooks takes a shovel of dirt from the pile and whistling
'By The Light Of The Silvery Moon', begins the task of
covering Mr. Smith.

INT. COFFEE SHOP � MORNING

A Newspaper is lying unfolded on the Counter next to the
remnants of a breakfast.

The headline reads - NATIONWIDE MANHUNT FOR THUMBPRINT KILLER
- Under that headline is a large picture of Mr. Smith aka Mr.
Baffert.

In the lower right corner is another headline to a story -
Murder Suicide For The Hangman -.

The reader of the paper is Mr. Brooks. On a stool next to
him, Marshall is also reading.

                    MARSHALL
          It says here the Thumbprint Killer
          is a monster... annoys you a little
          bit that you can't take credit,
          doesn't it?

                    MR. BROOKS
          Anyone who is good at what they do,
          wants recognition. But since I'm
          not going to do it anymore, I'll
          let Mr. Smith take the credit.

                    MARSHALL
          Don't kid yourself, Earl, you're
          going to kill again.

                    MR. BROOKS
          No, I'm not. I'll continue the AA
          meetings and I'll control it.

On the other stool next to Mr. Brooks is a WOMAN. Her large
purse hangs open from the back of the stool; the cel phone
clearly visible inside. Mr. Brooks looks at the phone.

	FADE IN:

	INT. THE TRAIN STATION - DAY

	We open on Hooker sleeping in some remote corner of the
	station, covered with newspapers for warmth, and barely
	distinguishable from the clutter of junk surrounding him.  A
	station security officer, on his morning sweep, wanders by
	and delivers a terrific blow to the soles of Hooker's feet
	with a nightstick.  Hooker jolts awake with a cry of pain,
	as the officer diffidently moves on toward another sleeping
	victim.

	Tired and sore from his night in the station, Hooker
	struggles to his feet and attempts to take stock of the
	situation.  He tries to smooth the wrinkles out of his suit,
	but it's futile.  A quick check of his wallet finds it as
	empty as he'd remembered it.

								CUT TO:

	THE STATION - GIFT SHOP - DAY

	Hooker walks in and goes to the toy section.  He looks
	through several small novelties, till he finds what he's
	looking for -- a little tin replica of a policeman's badge.
	He looks around for station detectives, and seeing none,
	slips the badge into his pocket.

								CUT TO:

	THE STATION - WASHROOM - DAY

	Hooker rinses out his mouth, towels off his face and slicks
	his hair back with water.  It's a drop in the bucket, but it
	seems to revitalize him a little.

	Hooker nods.  Gondorff switches on the carousel and steps
	back to admire his handiwork.  The carousel makes a grinding
	sound, does a few lurches and stops cold.

								CUT TO:

	Music begins and we are into a short:

	MONTAGE SEQUENCE

	Detailing the arrival of the others three members of
	Gondorff's "mob." Throughout, Gondorff wears the fedora hat
	which is his trademark.  We begin with --

	A tall, good-looking man, Kid Twist, making his way through
	the railway station.  Impeccably dressed and carrying a
	small suitcase, he combs the terrain carefully with his eyes.
	Finally he catches a glimpse of the thing he's been looking
	for.  It's Gondorff, standing by a newsstand.  Gondorff
	makes a quick snubbing motion on his nose as if flicking off
	a gnat.  This is known among con men as the "office." Twist
	returns the sign with a barely discernible smile as he walks
	on by.  Con men rarely acknowledge each other openly in
	public, but it's obvious that these two are glad to see each
	other.

          The Fillmore Lounge is a dreary looking bar up an alley off
          Dorchester Avenue.

                         
          Degenerate drinkers are now forced to go outside and smoke

          INT FILLMORE LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS
          And it's no more welcoming inside. Men come here to nurse
          their drug habits, their alcoholism and their hate.

                         
          While you wouldn't think there were many clamoring to get
          into their club, they don't look kindly on potential
          applicants.
          At one end of the bar, LENNY (mid 40' s) sips a whiskey and
          studies the Keno results. In the rear, 4 ALCOHOLICS sit
          around muttering to one another. And at one of the tables a
          CAULIFLOWER FACED MAN drinks alone.
          In addition there is a SMATTERING OF ROUGH LOOKING FACES.
          The bartender BIG DAVE (hence the name) has a newspaper
          spread out before him on the bar.

                    Nah. You know what I hold against you? We
                    had one chance to make this deal. You
                    said you knew him, you said you could do
                    it and you fucked it up. Now we have to
                    get a warrant for a tap, start
                    surveillance and hope to Christ we get
                    lucky. If that costs Amanda her life, I
                    won't have to hold it against you.
                    You'll hold it against yourself for a
                    good, long time.

               He hands the letter to Laurie who comes over eagerly, takes 
               it and studies the wrapper before opening it.

               she is reading skimmingly.

              You didn't forget the truffles?

     JEROME places the items in the refrigerator in the bathroom and
     retrieves a bottle of vodka - the vodka incongruous-looking
     beside the blood and urine specimens.  Joining Eugene at his
     workbench, he pours them both a drink.

                           EUGENE
                      (sensing something amiss, trying

                           JEROME
              They found him in his office this morning--
              beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.

     Eugene takes in the news, a smile broadening across his face.

                           EUGENE
              What an act of benevolence--a service to the
              community.  So that's it.  Now there's nothing
              between you and ignition.

              He was still warm when they confirmed.

              The place is crawling with Hoovers.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (angered by Hugo's excuses)
              I'll take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if
              you question my authority one more time!

     The INVESTIGATOR turns his back on his subordinate and idly
     contemplates the nearby telescope.  Hugo resignedly relays the
     news to Director Josef who is standing some distance away.
     Josef's immediate reaction is to march towards the Investigator,
     Hugo trailing behind.  DIRECTOR JOSEF collects himself as he
     notices the Investigator's hand on the telescope.

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
              Would you care to look--in the telescope?

                           INVESTIGATOR
              Thank you, no.

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
                      (still referring to the telescope)
              One look through there and you would know why
              I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations
              any further.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (unfazed)
              You're so unconcerned that you have a killer
              in your midst.

                      perceives as his mocking)
              You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment
              you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't
              for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get

              will be able to live to a ripe old age unless
              they do something foolish?

                           JEROME
              That's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they
              won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or
              <i>anything</i>--worth a Goddamn.

     Irene is taken aback by Jerome's passion, regarding him in a new

     EUGENE urinates into a large plastic container while drinking

     INT.  GATTACA.  MORNING.

     The INVESTIGATOR and DETECTIVE HUGO keep a wary eye on the
     outfitted DETECTIVES re-vacuuming the empty computer complex

              These new personality corrections I've been

               Eli climbs to his feet as the laughter subsides. Cameron, now
               wearing a uniform exactly like Raymond's, watches from the
               sidelines.

                          that brief bright love.
          
          Nina's listening intensely but something catches her eye. Among the
          tourists at the doorway stands Cameron, who has paused to watch, his
          costume slung over his shoulder. He nods to her with a small tender
          smile. Subtly, so Eli won't notice, she smiles back, then renews
          her concentration.

                 He FREEZES. Over his shoulder, we see Nina, naked, lying on the
                 bed. Raymond, also naked, sits slumped on the edge of the bed,
                 utterly disconsolate. The three stare at each other, an absurd
                 tableau. Cameron whirls and leaves, slamming the door behind him,
                 almost off its hinges.

                 He comes down the steps like a madman. Raging, Cameron stomps
                 across the lobby toward the glass doors that will take him out of
                 Eli's grotesque wonderland. He collides with a group of returning
                 night FISHERMEN still in their slickers, carrying their equipment,
                 their catch wrapped in newspapers. For a moment he is tangled in
                 their tackle, FISH TUMBLING AND SLIDING along the marble floor.

                Hands reach in and drape a sash around Nina's throat. From it
                dangles a SWASTIKA. For Nina, there is still no voice, no camera,
                only the obliterating shame for that image of her naked body burned
                into her father's memory. And yet, that shame is so similar to the

                The THUNDEROUS SOUND of ten thousand voices shouting: "Sieg Heil!
                Sieg Heil!" has shattered Nina's isolation. She is now aware that
                her personal despair has been used to accomplish an acting trick,
                and it only adds to her degradation and sense of shame, ironically
                making her performance even more poignant. The crowd on the

Arthur and Mack laugh and slap hands. Sock sneers at their
revelry.

The bell over the door tinkles and a heavyset BUTCH WOMAN
strolls in. Her head is shaved and a thick wallet chain
clinks against her ample carpenter pants. All three men turn
to stare.

          you know they like you more than

Alike plays along, swallowing her disappointment.

          Yeah.

Arthur pushes back from the table and pulls a fresh police
uniform out the hall closet. He lays it across the back of
the couch and unzips his pants. Alike turns her back to give
him privacy.

Surveillance camera footage of Archie's.

Five armed African-Americans, faces hidden under baseball

start to beat something out of him.

          ... I did what you said, right? Put
          it out on the street, trying to get
          info on the stones. Next thing I
          know, the Jackson Five here show
          up... Now, there are three
          significant elements to notice here.
          One, I'm outnumbered. Two, they're

          happened to the stones? Right? What
          good am I dead or on life-support.
          So I threw in the towel.
          Reluctantly, of course. For your

With a rekindled hope inspired by her father's escape,
Vanessa now looks for a way to free herself from her duct-

again, her eyes go to...
Her necklace.   The chain and pink diamond pendant.
Vanessa bends over    and lowers her head until the necklace
slides off onto the    bed. Then turns around and  picks up the
necklace behind her    back. Holding it as taut as  she can
between her hands,    she begins sawing away at the tape around
her wrists.

Casey's sitting shotgun as Matt drives. His face is
unreadable. They're driving on the I-5. More helicopters.
Downtown Portland is visible now, as are some fires.

Casey is quietly crying, the camera held loosely in her lap.

they zoom past, but Casey keeps the camera on Matt.

Casey is filming out the window, everything looks normal,
until there's a loud crash; then Casey swishes the camera to
reveal that a police car, its siren still moaning, has landed
on top of a newstand, apparently dropped from the sky.

There's an explosion from nearby and shattered glass rains
down onto the car. Matt slams on the brakes, looking up
through the windshield, searching the sky.

                    MATT
          Where are you, man?

There's a beat, and then a police officer abruptly appears on
the passenger's side, next to Casey.

The police officer is yanked upwards, disappearing from sight
for a moment before coming crashing down thirty feet away.

     CLOSE UP ON:

     A TRIPLE CARBON LAPD "INCIDENT REPORT" FORM trapped in an old
     Corona typewriter. The keys pound letters into the blank
     spaces.

     INCIDENT: THE ZOOT SUIT RIOTS...JUNE 10, 1943...
     REPORTING OFFICER...DWIGHT "BUCKY" BLEICHERT

     EXT. BOYLE HEIGHTS - EVERGREEN AND WABASH - DUSK

     A WORLD WAR II ERA PERSONNEL CARRIER transports twenty silent
     LAPD officers into the heart of downtown Los Angeles. The
     sounds of glass breaking and men screaming serves as backdrop
     for their arrival.

     We focus in on BUCKY BLEICHERT, 26, (The counterpuncher from
     the newsreels) as he jumps from the carrier.

     Bucky's minus his gun but plus a WWI tin helmet and a three
     pound truncheon.

     BUCKY'S POV:

     Hundreds of in-uniform GI's use baseball bats and two-by-
     fours to beat the shit out of Zoot Suit-wearing Mexicans.

     Most of the cops wander to the edge of the race riot and
     hobnob with the pockets of MPs and Shore Patrol who've chosen
     to "restore order" by cheering on their countrymen against
     the outnumbered but equally fierce zooters.

     Sailors shatter streetlights and shop windows. Darkness falls
     quickly on what Bucky rightly realizes is chaos.

     Suddenly Bucky's RUNNING--

     away from the action...

     down a side street and onto a

     QUIET RESIDENTIAL BLOCK.

     He slows to a jog, trying to gather his thoughts. And then a
     voice:

                          VOICE
               Bleichert! Bleichert!

     EXT. A BUNGALOW COURTYARD - SAME

     A POLICE OFFICER has THREE MARINES IN DRESS BLUES and ONE
     ZOOT SUITER cornered in a center walkway.

     The marines swipe clumsily at the officer with their two-by-
     fours as he bobs back and forth on the balls of his feet,
     dodging the blows like the ex-fighter he is.

     INT. ELLIS LOEW'S OFFICE - MORNING

     Lee and Bucky enter the Loew's inner sanctum where they are
     joined by Russ Millard and Harry Sears. A stack of L.A.

     Heralds sit on the desk, the top one folded to the headline:
     "Criminal Division's DA to try for Boss's Job in '48
     Primary?"

     Bucky's look of disgust says it all just as Loew walks into
     the room--

                          LEE
               Goin' into politics, Ellis? Give us a
               quote. (as FDR) "The only thing to fear
               is fear itself."

     Loew smiles thinly and hands over a photo and a rap sheet.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Here's the man to fear.

     ANGLE ON THE MUG SHOT AND RAP SHEET:

     RAYMOND "JUNIOR" NASH:  Statutory raps, armed robbery,
     felony mayhem...Texas State Prison...Alcatraz...

     The cops are impressed.

                          BUCKY
               Give us the good news. He's in LA and
               actin' uppity?

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Witnesses made him at a stickup near
               Leimert Park over the weekend. Pistol-
               whipped an old lady. She died about an
               hour ago.

                          RUSS MILLARD
               Anything common in the sex beefs?

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Negro girls. Young ones. All the
               complainants have been colored.

                          LEE
               Seeya in Leimert Park.

     FADE OUT

     EXT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - NIGHT

     Bucky rings the bell dressed in his Sunday best blazer.
     Madeleine answers, a knockout in a skirt and cashmere sweater.

                          MADELEINE
               Look. I hate to pull this, but Daddy has
               heard about you. He insisted you stay for
               dinner. I told him we met at that art
               exhibit at Stanley Rose's Bookshop, so if
               you have to pump everybody for my alibi,
               be subtle. All right?

                          BUCKY
               Sure.

     She leads him inside.

     INT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - CONTINUOUS

     Thick Persian carpets, tapestries, giant rooms with a men's
     club atmosphere.

     Next to the fireplace Bucky notices A STUFFED SPANIEL with a
     yellowed newspaper rolled into its mouth.

                          MADELEINE
                   (re the dog)
               That's Balto. The paper is the LA Times
               for August 1, 1926. Balto was bringing in
               the paper when Daddy's accountant told
               him he'd made his first million. Daddy
               wanted to consecrate the moment so he
               shot him. Here we go--

     INT. A SMALL SITTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     The Sprague family sits in matching easy chairs. No one
     stands up.

                          MADELEINE
               Bucky Bleichert. May I present my family.
               My mother, Ramona Cathcart Sprague. My
               father, Emmett Sprague. My sister, Martha
               McConville Sprague.

     Emmett Sprague jumps to his feet, pumping Bucky's hand.

                          BUCKY
               A pleasure, Mr. Sprague.

     INT. THE LOCKER ROOM - LATER

     Lee sits on the ground, head in his hands. Bucky enters and
     sits on a bench next to him.

                          LEE
               Did you see her face, Bucky? Did you see?

                          BUCKY
               Yeah. I did, partner. I did.

     Bucky notices Lee's still clutching the De Witt article in
     his fist. He pries it loose.

     Ellis Loew and Russ Millard enter.

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Goddammit, Blanchard! I got you Warrants.
               You're my man, and you made me look like
               a fool in front of the two most powerful
               men in the Department. If you weren't
               Mr. Fire you'd be suspended from duty
               already. You've gotten personally
               involved in the Short case--

                          BUCKY
                   (holding up the newspaper)
               Mr. Loew, it's not just Betty Short--

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Shut up, Bleichert.
                   (back to Lee)
               You're back on Warrants as of tomorrow.
               Report to me at 0800 with letters of
               apology for Green and Horrall. For the
               sake of your pension I'd suggest you
               grovel.

                          LEE
               I want to go to TJ--

                          ELLIS LOEW
               Blanchard!

     Poison hangs in the air. Ellis turns on his heels.

     INT. THE SQUADRON - DAY

     Bucky sits in his cubicle searching the Dahlia files. The
     clock behind him reads "12:30". Loew approaches.

               I beat up a wall. Penance for Nash.

                          BUCKY
               Not good enough.

     Bucky steps into Lee with fists flying, a mad demon. He
     smashes him again and again, beating his only friend until
     Lee slides senseless to the floor...

     INT. BUCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Bucky drinks bourbon straight, his wrist heavily bandaged.

                          VOICE OVER
               Losing the first Bleichert-Blanchard
               fight got me local celebrity, Warrants,
               and close to nine grand in cash;
               winning the rematch got me a sprained
               wrist, two dislocated knuckles and the
               rest of the day off. Whoever said winning
               isn't everything got that part right.

     EXT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - NEXT DAY

     Bucky walks into the house and finds Kay there. She holds up
     a newspaper: The front page includes The Black Dahlia, Junior
     Nash, and Bobby De Witt.

                          KAY
                   (eyes red from crying)
               We're famous, Dwight.

                          BUCKY
               Notorious, maybe. Where's Lee?

                          KAY
               I haven't seen him since you beat him up.

     Bucky looks ashamed.

                          KAY (cont'd)
               I don't blame you.

     He walks to her and she holds him.

                          BUCKY
               He's in trouble, you know.

     She nods. He strokes her hair.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               De Witt's probably in LA by now. If Lee
               doesn't show up by tonight I'll come over
               to stay with you.

               He's coming back.

     She nods, mollifying him.

     CLOSE ON: ROOM 204

     as Bucky jimmies the lock and pushes open the door.

     INSIDE ROOM 204

     Boxes of police falls scattered on the bed and desk. Photos
     of Elizabeth Short pinned up all over the walls: glamour
     glossies, newspaper photos, enlarged crime scene
     grotesquerie.

     The amount of manpower represented here is staggering; so
     much work over one girl.

     Bucky sits down at the desk and buries his head in his hands.

                          BUCKY
               Lee.

      Hector's face expresses his shock. From what he has
      heard at the meeting this is serious news. He makes a
      decision. He speaks to Francisco, willing their old
      friendship back into existence in the urgency of the
      moment.

                                 HECTOR
                   Will you share a bottle of wine

                   it tonight, with you.
      This offer has found a chink in Francisco's armor.

          Walter gets a far-off look.

                          WALTER
           Yeah. Cute little thing. I'd stare
           into those big orbs. Sometimes I'd
           get out my Brownie and snap a photo...
           but... that's not subjective. You
           know? It doesn't capture your
           feelings. So that's when I started
           painting her...
          We hold on Walter, unsure where reality begins and ends...

           CANADAY (ON TV)
           Keane's work is completely without
           distinction. He is not a member of
           the Society of Western Artists. He
           has won no awards. He's only
           noteworthy for his appearances in a
           certain newspaper's gossip column!

                          (EXASPERATED)
           Mr. Keane is why society NEEDS critics!
           To protect them from such atrocities!
          Walter gapes at the TV, outraged. He suddenly grabs a PHONE.

          IN THE LIVING ROOM
          Jane is BANGING on a closed door.

                          JANE
           Mom! I wanna come in.

           MARGARET (O.S.)

          The mighty courtroom steps are SWARMING WITH PEOPLE. It's a

           The art world is abuzz! Is it
           possible that the decade's top-selling
           painter can't even paint??!

                          REPORTER #2
           Or is Mrs. Keane simply a bitter ex-
           wife, trying to steal her husband's
           fame and fortune?

           Today in Federal Court, lawyers
           present their opening arguments in the
           case of Margaret Keane vs. Walter
           Keane and Gannett Newspapers. A trial
           that could produce the largest libel
           and slander award in Hawaiian history.
          Margaret, Jane, Margaret's LAWYER, and her FRIENDS walk up.

          Walter and a POSSE OF LAWYERS exit a towncar. The REPORTERS
          charge over, as Walter puts on a confident face.

                          REPORTER #1
           Mr. Keane! Are you at all concerned
           about the charges?

                          WALTER
           I'm angry as hell! But I'm lucky to
           have the mighty Gannett News Company
           watching my back. I expect to have
           this whole trial dismissed by noon.

                          (BEAT)
           Truthfully, my only concern is that

           psychiatric care. She needs it!

           This is a very strange case. These
           paintings hang in museums all over the
           world, attributed to Mr. Keane. And
           regardless of the truth, Mrs. Keane
           has contributed immeasurably to the
           confusion...
          The Judge stares off... then makes a decision.

                          JUDGE
           It seems impossible that Gannett's
           actions would ever meet the legal
           standard for libel. So -- the charge
           against them is dismissed.

           NO! It's not a mistrial!! In my
           opinion, there's only one way to clear
           up this thicket. You are both going
           to paint.
          Walter gasps, stunned. All color drains from his face.

          ANGLE - MARGARET
          Her face lights up. She slowly breaks into a satisfied smile.

          The doors SLAM open. The Bailiff leads in a crew of COURT
          DEPUTIES, all carrying ART SUPPLIES: Easels, brushes, paint...

                          BAILIFF
           Awright, bring those easels down.
           Careful, don't bump anything... watch
           it with those paint cans, I got some
           newspaper on the floor down front...
          The Jury is fascinated.
          Margaret watches, quite eager. In the gallery, Jane grins.
          But Walter is horrified. Trying not to tremble.

                         DOWN FRONT
          The Bailiff directs the deputies, setting up TWO EASELS, back
          to back. On each easel is placed a small square canvas.
          The Judge addresses the room.

                          JUDGE
           Now, I'm not looking for a
           masterpiece. I don't know much about
           these things -- I'm a jurist, not an
           art critic -- but, is one hour enough?
          Margaret nods: Sure.
          Shaking, Walter barely moves his head.

                          JUDGE
           Okay then. You've both been provided
           with identical supplies... so --
           without any further business... Mrs.
           Keane, Mr. Keane, the court is yours.

INT. KITCHEN - BEYNON - LATE AFTERNOON/NIGHT

BEYNON SITS AT THE LONG KITCHEN TABLE] head on hand, eyes
slightly glared... on the checkered oilcloth in front of him
is a quart bottle of Jim Beam, now half full. He's drinking
the sour mash straight with a water chaser.

DOC LOOKS STEADILY AT BEYNON for a moment,, sets the suitcase
down on the floor, then crosses to the sink, picks up a glass
and sits down at the table. Doc pours himself a drink, takes
a sip.

                    BEYNON
          Hello, McCoy.

                     DOC
          Beynon.

                    BEYNON
              (swishing the drink)
          News said two persons killed.

Except for a faint thickness of speech, Beynon seems quite
sober. Beynon wears a .38 Detective Special C.T.G. in a worn
leather belly holster.

                    DOC
          Three... Rudy got ambitious.

                    BEYNON
          And you got him...

                    DOC
          That's right.

Doc looks at Beynon, notes his gun, then continues stacking
the money.

                    BEYNON
          What about your wife?

INT. DOC AND CAROL'S CAR - DAY

AS IT MOTORS DOWN THE TEXAS HIGHWAY. The black suitcase is
propped up between Doc and Carol in the front seat. Doc,
seated on the passenger side, bangs the car radio with his
hand. The radio is obviously not working as he turns the
dials and pushes the buttons.

                    DOC
              (cajoling it)
          C'mon workl I
              (almost pleading)
          C'mon.

We hear garbled words for a moment, pleasing Doc... and then
the radio conks out again. This time Doc hits the radio hard.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
              (angrily to the radio)
          Give me the news!!

When it is clear that the radio won't work:

                    DOC (CONT'D)
          You can't trust anything these days.

                    CAROL
          I'll tell you something, Doc. One day
          you're going to have to trust somebody...

DOC SLAMS THE BRAKE, GRABS THE WHEEL as the car veers over to
the side of the road.

                     DOC
          I trust...
              (he opens the black suitcase)
          Want to see what I trust... In God we
          trust...

          You keep it up and it won't matter how
          far we get away, because it's going to be
          all over between you and me. Do you
          understand that? There won't be anything
          left.

DOC WEARS A SUNBEATEN LEATHER JACKET, READING A NEWSPAPER,
while leaning against a hot dog stand. One foot rests on the
suitcase. The Invicta has been re-wrapped in a laundry bag.
The paper is filled with news of the robbery and a mug shot
of Doc.

A GREY MERCURY PULLS UP NEAR THE DOGGIE DINER. Carol is
driving. Doc walks up to the window of the car.

          We get to Mexico, we can have a life.

                    CAROL
          That's all I want... It's the only thing
          I have ever wanted.

As she pulls herself against him:

                    DOC
          I'm going to try and get it for you.

They pull each other closer, tightly holding one another.

RUDY IS LYING IN BED READING A NEWSPAPER PILLED WITH DOC AND
CAROL. The fact that they have been seen in the North. He
smiles.

Fran is in the bed beside him asleep naked under the sheets.

              (calling softly)
          Harold, you've had ten minutes, get out
          of there.

No answer. Rudy gets up and crosses to the bathroom.

                     CAROL
           I guess we are.

After a moment:

                     DOC
           Why don't you try the news?

Carol snaps on the radioj the voice of a Mexican announcer is
heard.

                     CAROL
           No more news, from now on we're just

THEY ARE WALKING ALONG THE HIGHWAY, THE EDSEL IS now a dot in
the background. Another dot appears, grows bigger, as it gets
closer it is a bus. Very Mexican but very Greyhound in
appearance.

Doc and Carol turn, Doc flags it down.

It pulls to a stop, they board. The bus pulls out.

               Suddenly the T.V. blares into the room. Sam jumps up, grabbing 
               the remote control unit from under his buttocks. Molly laughs

               holding the remote control. She nods for him to lie down.

               your talk... I lost $380,000 this weekend... I was going to get 
               married... I had a life... 
 
               BRANDON staring at the phone, barely holding it together, sees 
               TAMMY standing there -- holding the day's newspapers, hearing 
               the conversation on speaker.
 
                                     AMIR
               No words now, huh?  No more money to squeeze so you shut up. 
                How do you fucking live with yourself?  
 
               Click.  Amir hangs up.  Crushing beat.  TAMMY staring at him.

               glances down, something catches his eye.  BRANDON pulls a newspaper 
               from the pile -- finds himself staring at a full-page ad for 
               JOHN ANTHONY.  Big smile.  Copy advertising "The Million Dollar

               back on the board.  He stares up at the weights.  Moves the weight 
               pin to 250... and slowly starts to lift.  One rep.  Two.  Three. 
                Four.  A bad of sweat forms.  BRANDON throws off the jacket. 
                Pulls off the tie.  Removes his shirt and shoes.  He resumes

               himself in the mirror.  He pulls reams of stats and newspaper

               fumbling with his sheets of data, desperately searching for an 
               answer when he suddenly hurls it all in the trash.  Kicks the

               Heads, New York.  Tails Denver.

           The only thing popular about it is that
           it's written about in newspapers. I'm

	She hangs up -- takes the phone off the hook and lays it on the
	bed for a moment's solitude.  She sits stiffly, palms on top of
	her legs.  It looks like someone with unusually good posture,
	waiting for something, and now we BEGIN TO SEE the first signs
	redden and she begins to cry.  Now she sobs -- then miraculously
	shakes it off and exits quickly to the bathroom.  This crying
	episode is clearly part of her morning routine.

	Jane standing behind her husband-wife - camera-sound team

	begins to rasp.

				JANE
		We are being increasingly influenced

	WIDER

	Tom the last person remaining in the room.  He approaches her --

	mounts the stage with an athletic leap.  It takes courage for

	He notices that her head has gone into her hands where it
	continues to rest.  He looks at her a beat.

	She lifts her head.

	INT. JANE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	A small good room -- her working paraphernalia very much in
	evidence...the quality briefcase...the reams of well organized
	notes...the thick contact book -- Jane is sitting on the bed --
	Tom, not far away in the room's only chair.  One lamp is on
	and it serves to place Jane in the shadows and cast Tom in an
	enormously flattering light.  MUSIC comes from her miniature
	portable STEREO system.

				JANE
		Come on...Even I'm not that
		hard on myself.

		No, I really got this job on a
		fluke and wait till you hear where
		it ends up.

	Jane smiles a calming smile.

				JANE
		I was doing sports at the station.
		The newspaper ran this untrue story
		that I was leaving and they got all
		these tons of protest mail.  So they
		made me anchor.

				JANE
		So great -- right?

				TOM
		Except I'm no good at what I'm being
		a success at.

				JANE
		How are you at back rubs?

	Jane shifts her position so that her back is to Tom... He is
	immobilized by the sudden turn.  Jane waits, just a bit longer
	than it would take a man to run from the chair to her side before
	experiencing the ghost-like clutch of rejection.  She moves
	briskly past the moment -- grabbing a "good night" chocolate
	from the pillow and munching it as she return to <u>his</u> agenda.

				JANE
		It's sort of normal -- the way you
		feel.  In graduate school everyone
		thought the only mistake the
		admission committee made was letting
		them in.

	INT. ERNIE MERRIMAN'S OFFICE

	ERNIE MERRIMAN is the network's Washington Bureau Chief.  He
	is in his early 60's, has worked for the network about 40 years
	-- part of the golden age -- a family man, an honorable man,
	a good guy.  Right now he is welcoming Tom to the network
	thereby good-naturedly helping with the destruction of all he
	holds dear.  As he hands Tom his credentials:

				ERNIE
		Any particular area you feel
		strongest in?

				TOM
		To be honest, I was best at anchor.

	Ernie gives him a long look -- is he kidding?

				ERNIE
		Why don't you take a few days observing
		the system?  Then we'll put you on
		general assignment.

		Yes, there is.

	Blair leaves, as Jane gathers up her notes.  She charges out
	leaving Tom awkwardly along with Bobbie.

				TOM
		I'm Tom Grunick.  I started on
		General Assignment today.

	Bobbie stops the machine, turns in his chair and shakes hands.
	Then he smiles secretly and speaks his first full sentence.

	INT. BUREAU NEWSROOM

	Aaron is having a theoretical discussion with Ernie and
	JENNIFER MACK, a correspondent in her early 40's, a pioneer
	beauties in news.  She is well-schooled, bred, trained and
	known... GEORGE WEIN, a black correspondent in his 40s, and
	MARTIN KLEIN, formerly with the Johnson administration --
	State Department correspondent for the network.

				KLEIN
		Okay, what about this?  Here's a
		tough ethical one.  Would you tell
		a source that you loved them just
		to get some information?

				AARON
		Yes.

				GEORGE
		Yes.

				ERNIE
		Me too.

	the adrenaline deadening the pain -- she arrives at a waiting
	elevator -- uses a key dangling from her neck to unlock it... jumps
	nervously during the ride and now, in FULL EXTENDED FLIGHT, barrels
	down the long corridor heading to the control room where she
	arrives; slamming the tape into a technician's hand even as it is
	introduced on the air.

	and opens a bottom drawer -- a clean whit shirt lies there.
	He opens the center drawer -- two ties are inside.  He picks
	one.  He reaches for a package of new red suspenders.  He takes
	off the shirt and puts on the new one -- all of this the work
	of an expert craftsman.  By the time he finishes he looks like
	the authority figure we know he's now.

	INT. BUREAU NEWSROOM - JANE AND BLAIR

	Jane is NOT hyper.  She is purposeful -- organized -- even
	calming Blair with a little physical contact -- a touch on
	the arm, to still her colleague's hysterical demons.

		Tell George and Jessica to try

	past one other man until he is standing directly behind her.

				TOM
		I just want you to know that my
		giving up the Correspondents' Dinner
		puts tremendous pressure on you.

	Jane turns and is a bit blown away by his gesture -- life
	threatens to be good.  And now Jane bumps a bit at the top of
	the escalator, regaining her balance by grabbing Tom's offered
	hand.  As they walk they continue to deliberately hold hands.

	INT. NEWS STUDIO - NIGHT

	WE are on the studio floor, FOCUSING on the activity around
	the Anchor Desk and three cameras... The FLOOR MANAGER stands
	ready to cue Aaron, the script is ready to roll on the prompter
	machine.

				FLOOR MANAGER
		Twenty seconds.

	ON AARON

	Making sure he is seated on his jacket -- taking one last look
	at the hand mirror being held by the MAKEUP WOMAN.  She starts
	off -- but Aaron regrabs the mirror almost making her lose her
	footing -- a check -- then another check -- he points to a spot
	on his forehead which she dabs with the makeup sponge... Both of
	them fuss enormously with his hair -- four busy hands.

				FLOOR MANAGER
		Ten seconds.

				AARON
		How many?

	INT. JANE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	As she enters -- goes immediately to the phone.

	ON PHONE...

	Cradled in an answering machine -- indexes for sixteen
	one-button calls, mostly people from work -- "Parents" etc.
	Jane plays her answering tape.  It is silent -- no messages...
	She fast forwards to double-check.  Just the SOUND of blank
	tape.  She pushes the button next to the "Tom Grunick."  We
	HEAR a busy signal.

	ON JANE

	She hangs up the phone.  Then compulsively hits the "Tom"
	button again.  Busy.  And again.  Busy.  She considers for
	a moment hitting the button next to Aaron's name.

				JANE
			(stopping herself)
		Be fair.

	She presses the button next to Tom's name.  Busy.  And again.
	Busy.

	EXT. ERNIE MERRIMAN'S HOUSE - MONDAY MORNING

	As he picks up for newspapers dotting his lawn and opens the
	door of his car -- just as his wife calls from the door.

				WIFE
		Ernie, they're calling from work.

				ERNIE
		Tell me I'm on the way in.

				WIFE
		It's Paul.

	Ernie, just a bit concerned, walks back to his house -- the
	four newspapers thick enough to be an awkward carry.

	INT. ERNIE'S HOUSE

	A phone in the immaculate living room.

		How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll

				ERNIE
		No.  They're firing even more people
		than they said.  Some will want to
		talk.  It could help.

				WIFE
			(timidly)
		I could use somebody to talk to on

			(on his reaction)
		Sorry. Go ahead.

	He kisses her sad face.

				ERNIE
		Bye, sweetie.

				WIFE
		Okay, sweetie.

	He walks towards the door -- picks up his newspapers on the
	tray beneath the hall mirror and does a start.

	HIS P.O.V.

	In the mirror he SEES his wife making faces at him behind his
	back.  He EXITS his home without comment.

	INT. EDITING ROOM - DAY

	Jane is sitting in her editing cubby -- it is past noon.  She
	rises and stands in her doorway looking toward Tom's office --
	the door is open, the room is empty.  Blair ENTERS carrying
	an armload of tapes.  She looks extraordinary.

	Jane waves it off.

		Some of it they use water cannons.

				JANE
			(without passion)
		I kept trying to call you -- you

	A little smile to Tom and he's off.

	Tom enters the room.  A nervous cough in evidence as he
	crosses to a seat.

				PAUL
		We're having a severe cutback, Tom --

	INT. NEWSROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

	Aaron and Ernie are off to the side in the newsroom -- People
	are packing their belongings -- as secretaries cry and embrace --
	from an office rumbles a shouted denunciation:

		No.  I won't keep my voice down.

		are bad accountants.

	Tom enters scene.

	INT. TOM'S OFFICE - DAY

	AS he picks up a clean wastebasket and deposits his belongings.
	A scheduled book, clean shirt, two ties, cuff-links, a travel
	mirror, cassettes of his Washington reporting.  His desk clear --
	he writes on a clean piece of copy paper.  He centers it on his
	desk.

	INSERT - PAPER

	"Good luck, you'll love the bureau chief... Previous Occupants."

	INT. NEWSROOM - DAY

	AS Tom enters from his office, a wake is slowly igniting.  Tom
	moves along the edge of the room, carrying his wastebasket full
	of belongings, not really a part of the mournful festivities.

	TOM'S P.O.V.

	Jane across the room hugging one person after another.

	ON JANE

	AS she embraces an older secretary.

	Jane smiles -- Aaron has grown suddenly angry.  He rises,
	walks away, then turns.

				AARON
		Jane, you know how Tom had tears in
		the piece the other night?  Ask

	As she locates the cassette labelled "DATE-RAPE - 9/26 -

		...but the whole thing messed me
		up more than it should.

	She cries.  We HEAR Tom.

				TOM'S VOICE
		Okay, that will do it.  You okay?

	The tape is rocky now -- the Sound Woman and Cameraman
	continue to roll as they move towards their next shot --
	at times the camera pointing towards the carpet -- but
	the sound continues.  The crew chatting -- mentioning
	that the tape is still rolling.

		That's not going to be the way

	EXT. CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

	Much the same place where Jane and Tom first met.  The

	A sign off to one side tells us it's the annual meeting of the

	Much the same audience, though two members of the audience

	Tom is in mid-speech.

				TOM
		... when they told me Bill had decided

	Some good-natured laughter.

				TOM (cont'd)
		And then when they heard my reaction --
		they thought I was kidding.  I told them
		I'd be their anchor but I didn't want
		to be the Managing Editor -- that there
		were people better qualified than I to 
		control the content and if there 
		weren't we were all in trouble.

	The audience really enjoys this:

	SAME SCENE -- SOME MINUTES LATER

	MOVING SHOT...

	The anchor teams -- leaning forward.  They love this man,
	a humble specialist refusing the generalist trap.  Imagine
	the feeling -- you see, on the top of the mountain, a man
	not unlike yourself.

				TOM
		And now to something more

               Wade, open phone book in hand, walks back and forth speaking

               an old newspaper in front of her.

               The other party has hung up. Margie stands, upset. Wade slams

               Well, the bride is sure snotty

     Smiling, Toby waits for some response to his teasing,

71   EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - AFTERNOON                     71
     Toby, his news bag slung over his shoulder, stands
     talking idly with two boys from school, OSCAR BOOKER and
     JIMMY VOORHEES. One of them says, "Uh-oh," and jerks his
     head to indicate where Toby and the other boy should
     look.
     They look in the direction indicated, and see Arthur
     Gayle coming down the road toward them, followed by a
     small black dog called Pepper. As the boys watch
     Arthur's approach:
                             TOBY
               What's his name again?

                No, say 'You're not a sissy.'
     Toby glances at Oscar and Jimmy. Their faces are gleeful
     but he doesn't care what the hell they think.
                              TOBY
                You're not a sissy.
     Arthur immediately turns and walks away, but Toby ignores
     them and walks away in the opposite direction, delivering
     his hated newspapers.

72   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON         72

     Caroline is painting the white walls a soothing buff
     color.  On the sofa lie half-finished curtains she's
     making.  She is totally focused. She hears Toby, turns,
     sees his filthy clothes. Her shoulders sag.
                              CAROLINE
                I won't do it, you know. I won't
                be a referee between the two of
                you.

                You both do. You do. Just by

       Jacey sits in his favorite armchair reading the Sunday

                   What's wrong with you?

       goes into the kitchen to tend to it. There is a soft
       KNOCK on the front door. Doug goes to answer it. He
       opens the door and finds Pamela standing there with her
       coat in her hand. He is pleasantly surprised; Pam is
       distant, slightly off-balance.

                                 DOUG

      Helen's closed casket is surrounded by floral tributes.
      Doug and Jacey enter from a door near the casket -- they
      pause in reaction to the crowded parlor, it overflows
      with mourners. Jacey explodes under his breath, so that
      only Doug can hear:

                              JACEY
                Fucking hypocrites -- every one of
                'em.

      hesitates when he sees Lloyd Abbott standing in the back
      of the parlor.

                 Do you want this picture of
                 Grandma?

                               DOUG
                 You can have it.

               There are three mail slots. Enid pulls the mail out of the 
               first one. We see FLOWER BULB CATALOGUES, and LADIES HOME

               She shoves back the contents of slot number two and grabs 
               the mail from Rebecca. We hear MALE VOICES around the corner.

                                     REBECCA
                         Wait! Do you hear that?

                         was standing right next to Seymour

                              (then to Dana)

                         Normally you have to have references 
                         and at least two years of experience,

               Good morning.


     INT. OPERA HOUSE, COSTUME SHOP, DAY

     Gerda and Einar try on wigs, surreptitious, excited, adjust
     one another's choices. Then, a long line of almost identical
     shoes, beginning in tiny sizes but gradually getting bigger.
     Einar grabs the last - biggest - pair. When he looks up,
     Gerda's showing him a dress...


     INT. OPERA HOUSE, STAGE DOOR, DAY

     Einar and Gerda head out past the stage doorman, very pleased
     with themselves. Gerda is several sizes fatter and taller -
     she wears a wig with a hat on top. Hands stuffed into coat
     pockets hide bulky shoes. Thorbjorn looks up briefly from
     his newspaper. Then as the door closes behind Einar and
     Gerda, he looks up again - ?

     - MONTAGE ENDS -


     INT. WIDOW HOUSE, EVENING

     The Lili sketches depict a gamut of moods, face and posture
     already becoming iconic. Einar in the slip and the new
     shoes, practising his walk to settle his nerves. Hears the
     front door open - quickly calls:

                         EINAR
               I wondered where you were, it's getting
               late.

               We have plenty of time.     I bought these...

     entertained at his enthusiasm, but a little apprehensive..

          I've a new dealer coming over later.    I'd
          like you to meet him.

                    EINAR
          I don't want a new dealer. It doesn't make
          sense for me. I'm hardly working anyway.

                    GERDA
          That might change.

                    EINAR
          I don't think so.    I'm happy helping you.

She goes to contradict, but he cuts her off:

                       EINAR (cont'd)
          No dealer.     Thank you.

                    GERDA

An intimate place by the Pont Neuf. An empty chair at the

          It was handmade, and I've had it

             I've listened carefully and I'm afraid it's
             not good news.

From the couch, Einar waits for the diagnosis.

             Well, I don't really know what kind of help
             I need, but I can't go on living without
             knowing who I am.

             Mm... very good...

Dr Mai nods vigorously, scribbles definitively onto a pad.

                       MAI
             Please excuse me a moment...

He nods politely goes out, leaving Einar alone. Curiosity
gets the better of Einar and he works his way to the desk,
looks at the pad. As the sun falls across it, he can clearly
see the imprint of a word: schizophrenic... Einar panics,
grabs his coat...

     Suddenly, her eyes SNAP to meet Ishmael's in the mirror.  His dart
     away.  Hers hold.

                               HATSUE
                     This trial is unfair.  You should

                     Just that.  This trial is <u>wrong</u>,
                     they are calling a good man a killer.
                     It is only about prejudice, and that
                     is unfair.

     He thinks.  As he drives.  Hisao Imada silent beside him.

                     arrest people or convict them.  Or
                     run a newspaper.

     And his eyes come up.  Meet hers in the mirror.

                               ISHMAEL
                     Maybe I <u>should</u> write a column.
                     What do you think?

     She studies his face.

     No smile.  On either side.

                               ISHMAEL
                     I think people.  Should be fair.

     His eyes on the road now.  The farmhouse seen through the drifting
     screen of white.

                               HATSUE
                     Will you write that?

     Her voice is soft.  The difference is palpable.

                      The roadblocks are everywhere. They are
                      looking for children. They shout, "Kill
                      the babies to clear the infestation."

          We hear the GOUNOD WALTZ starting in the Big Top.

                         EARL (CONT'D)
          A few of the guys that got tossed
          caught up with us again.

                         JACOB
          Walter! Is he---?
          Instantly, Earl's expression tells Jacob it's bad news.
          Jacob's breathing almost stops as he listens;

                         EARL
          Keep walking...They got tossed off
          the trestle, if you can believe it.
          Camel's head hit the rocks. He died
          right away...
          Jacob is heartbroken and dreads what he's about to hear. Earl
          pauses for a beat...this part is harder to tell:

                         EARL (CONT'D)
          ...Walter...Walter's legs were
          smashed up real bad..They had to
          leave him.

                         (BEAT)
          They don't reckon he lasted the
          night.
          Jacob is in shock. He can barely walk on...

                         EARL (CONT'D)
          The ones that came back...Bill...
          Grady.. I don't know how but, one
          way or another they're taking down
          August tonight.
          Hearing this, Jacob stops to face Earl.

               Matt and Beth lie on an open sofa-bed. "WOW" is completed,

          oldest daughter, ANNIE, comes to the door of the garage.
                         
                          ANNIE
           Dad. Mr. Walsh is here.
                         
          ABEL looks around behind ANNIE to see ANDREW standing there.
          He waves him into the garage. The boxes are stacked almost
          to the ceiling around them.

           I'm sorry for the dramatic drop in
           but your phone doesn't seem to be
           working.
                         
                          ABEL
           It's not set up yet... So I am
           guessing this isn't good news here
           on a Sunday night.
                          ANDREW WALSH
           No... It looks like they are coming
           after us.
                         
                          ABEL
           That describes many people at this

           talking about... what shots?
                         
          The camera now comes around to the outside of the car looking
          back at ABEL through the windshield. The mansion is looming
          in the background. We see ABEL'S face react as he hears the
          news of the incident on the bridge. The camera pulls back as
          ABEL'S face goes totally cold.

               The CB CONTINUES TO CRACKLE with news of the roadblock. 
               Jenny's eyes restlessly search the overpass under the whirling 
               yellow chicken for any sign of the STAR MAN. She sees the 
               dun-colored Roadrunner waiting at the foot of the on-ramp 
               for a break in the traffic, but she is too far away to see 
               who's inside. As the Porsche gets closer, it overtakes an 18-
               wheeler and Jenny's view of the Roadrunner is cut off 
               entirely. She passes without seeing the STAR MAN.

               Flaemmchen, believing the telegram to be something that she

               Preysing paces the room with the telegram.

               Flaemmchen rises, stretches. Quite naturally she glances at 
               the pictures on Preysing's dressing-table.

      Night has passed, day is coming. All the earlier energy has
      dissipated into anticlimax and weariness. People straggle
      across the yard in groups toward their vehicles...

approaches, briefcase in hand, files under her arm.

             We dug pretty deep for one night.
             Still got a ways to go, but on a

             Well, that's good news.

She trudges toward her car, following the ADAs toward their
vehicles. Nick trades relieved looks with the men -- everybody
coming down from a tense night. Davies shakes their hands:

                           DAVIES
             Fellas. For once, glad not to be of
             assistance.

                           DUNNIGAN
             Love it when they cry wolf.

The men separate in different directions. Dunnigan catches a
glimpse of Sarah almost at her car -- she loses a page from
under her arm, which flutters away on the breeze.

                   Yes. Your mother and I really
                   want to hear this, Sherman.
                                 SHERMAN
                   A bond is a way of lending   people
                   money.  Let's say you want   to

          were hostile?

          Yes.  They would invade us using
          only ground tactics.  Hand to hand
          combat.  They wouldn't use their
          technology or fight an airborne
          battle, because they would know we
          would eventually use nuclear
          weapons and the planet would be
          useless to them.

               Claude rips open the letter. A profound disappointment settles 
               over him as he reads the news from cousin Maynard. Bitterly, 
               he crumples up the letter and tosses it down.

               he passes, Claude moves a little closer to Ray.

                         for a moment. He's a successful lawyer 
                         up in New York City and you're down 
                         here with a bright future in the

           me. Let's be honest with each other
           about what we each want. I want to milk
           the last ounce of baseball you have left
           in you, and you want to stay in the show.
           So let's do that. I'm not paying you to
           be the player you used to be, I'm paying
           you to be the player you are now. You're
           smart, you know what's going on here. I

           Stop! Just please, stop! I'm just
           a guy. I'm just a truck driver.
           Okay? I'm nobody that makes
           decisions about anything. I just
           want to go home.
          Silence from the other end of the phone for an extended

           You make video, ransom video.
          This surprisingly comes as good news to Paul.

                         

                          PAUL
           Yes. Please. Get me out of here
           and I'll make the video.

                          JABIR
           No. You make video now.

                          PAUL
           What...? How?

                          JABIR
           You use video on phone.
          Paul's hopes are dashed. His sanguine head falls back onto
          the coffin floor.

Yes, it is.

Bateman moves to the CD player. He takes a CD out of its 
case and slides it in the machine.

BATEMAN 
In 1987 Huey released this, Fore!, their most 
accomplished album. I think I heir undisputed masterpiece is 
"HiP To Be Square," a song so catchy that most people probably 
don't listen to the lyrics. But they should because it's not 
just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of 
trends. It's al~ a personal statement about the band itself.

Bateman puts on "Hip To Be Square."

BATEMAN crosses the room and picks up the ax.

We follow BATEMAN from behind as he walks up to Owen, the 
ax raised over his head.

Hey, Paul?

As Owen turns around, FROM OWEN'S POV we see Bateman swing 
the ax toward his face.

Blood sprays onto the white raincoat.

FROM BEHIND OWEN, we see BATEMAN as he yanks the ax out.

Owen drops to the floor. His body falls out of the frame. 
We stay on his legs twitching mechanically.

Blood pulses onto the newspaper-covered floor.

Bateman takes his raincoat off, still panting. He folds the 
coat carefully in half, bloody side in, and drapes it neatly 
over the back of a chair.

He sits back on the white sofa and surveys the scene. He 
checks his Rolex and lights a cigar.

OFFSCREEN, Paul Owen's last faint sighs are heard.

Stan stands smiling over Chuck.

          Chuck.  Wake up Chuck.

Chuck pulls off the mask, takes out the earplugs.  He manages
a groggy grin.

                     STAN
          You gotta do your own delivery from here.

INT.  SUPERHUB - NIGHT

Chuck walks through the extraordinary nexus of speeding
packages that intersect in intricate paths above and around
him.  This is the beating center of the FedEx world, the
crossroads, the deep core where everything connects.  In his
still-drugged state it all seems weirdly psychedelic.  A
Christmas tree goes by, then a huge plastic Santa Claus, both
with shipping labels.

EXT.  CHICKASAW GARDENS - MEMPHIS - NIGHT

Chuck's car pulls into the driveway of a small cottage in an
older Memphis neighborhood.  The radio is playing the news.

INT.  CHUCK'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck drops his briefcase and his bag.  The place is a jumble
of clothes, papers, books, etc.  In the living room is a tank
of tropical fish.  The water looks a little green.  No
bubbles are coming from the filter.

Uh oh.

Chuck walks to the tank.  He tightens a piece of tape that
holds the power cord onto the filter, taps the filter with
his finger, once, twice...the bubbles start again.

                     CHUCK
          Damn thing.

But for a couple of fish floating on top of the tank it's too
late.

Chuck gets out his scoop and slowly skims them off.

                     CHUCK
          Sorry, I'm really sorry.

Chuck digs a small hole in the back yard with a large kitchen
spoon.

Drops the dead fish in.

Fills the hole.

This is not a happy woman he is leaving behind.

EXT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - HOUSE LATER

It's dark now.  Chuck returns.  The stars are putting on an
amazing show, but he doesn't notice as he heads for the door.

INT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

Chuck enters.  The tree and the presents under it are gone.

                     CHUCK
          Kelly?  Kelly?

No answer, nothing but the sound of Jango, who begins yelping
in the kitchen.

INT.  KELLY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck picks up Jango, who is barricaded in the kitchen with
some food, some water, and some wet newspapers.

          There.  There.  Easy now.

Holding Jango, Chuck walks out into the back yard.

          Kelly?

A fire still smolders.  The packages have burned.  The tree
is a blackened mess.

Chuck stares at it.

EXT.  CHUCK'S HOUSE - NEXT MORNING

Chuck gets into his car, puts Jango on the front seat next to
him.  Pulls out of the driveway.

               A WAITRESS appears suddenly at GENE's elbow, surprising him. 
               She puts a basket of pretzels next to him and a coaster next 
               to his drink.

               Elsewhere, GENE circles around the lobby. There seem to be 
               clocks everywhere.

               A. set of four clocks over the registration desk with the 
               time for Tokyo, Los Angeles, New York, and Paris.

               1:15! GENE's watch and all the clocks tick over at once. 
               GENE winces as if he could hear all those minute hands tick 
               over one number in a thunderous chorus.

               He's near the Men's Room. HUEY's stand has a sign on the

               moveable hands. "We'll be back at 1:30."

INT. SHOP. NR CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAWN.

The HUM of a large refrigerator just audible over the
sound of Indian music -
MARGARET, briefly glimpsed pondering cartons of milk.
The electronic PEEP of the cash til.
A man on a mobile phone pushes past MARGARET, who takes
her place second in the queue.
The female shopkeeper piles newspapers on the counter in
front of MARGARET. Distracted by images of the bombed
hotel on the TV, she hesitates for beat.

                        MAN BEHIND THE COUNTER
          One forty-nine please.

                        MARGARET
          How much is the milk?

          Forty-nine pence.

          Thank you.
MARGARET turns to leave, jostled by a tall young man
wired into an ipod.

            MARGARET reaches for a jug, pouring milk into it, sliding
            it down on a table.

                      Good grief! We'll have to
                      economise. I suppose we could
                      always sell the car.
                           (chuckles)
                      Or take in paying guests!
            He scoops up the newspaper and glances towards the door -
                                    DENIS (CONT'D)
                      Watch out. She's on the prowl.
            MARGARET looks beyond DENIS to a a sense of growing
            commotion. A concerned POLICE GUARD coming up the stairs
            meeting JUNE [early 60's] MARGARET's carer, along a
            distant corridor, steady on the approach.
                                    MARGARET
                           (to DENIS)
                      Eat your egg.
            JUNE smiles with visible relief on seeing MARGARET, now
            sitting tapping open her egg.
                                    JUNE
                      Goodness! There you are.

                      Yes.
            MARGARET eats her egg.

                      He wasn't a lonely man, though.

                                  INSPECTOR
                      What makes you think so?

                                  KAFKA
                      ... Just a perception.

                                                        CUT:

        HALLWAY

        Kafka comes out of a door that closes behind him.  He stands
        and waits.  At a high desk a POLICEMAN is reading a
        newspaper.  Without even looking up from it he extends his
        arm and pushes Kafka slightly to one side so he's no longer
        blocking the light.

        Two other MEN are here waiting, sitting on a bench, sharing a
        private joke.  Kafka glances down at himself, wondering if
        his appearance could in any way inspire ridicule.

        The door opens again and the Inspector is back.

                                  INSPECTOR
                      I don't usually involve myself
                      with you people in the Old Quarter
                      -- but the River runs its own course.
                      It won't be the last time it
                      deposits its unwanted debris on my
                      doorstep.

        Pause.

                                  KAFKA
                      Probably not.

                                  INSPECTOR
                      Anyway, I'd like you to reflect
                      that in me you have -- I won't say
                      a friend, because we're complete
                      fencers, of course -- from
                      distinctly incompatible social
                      classes -- but to some extent, shall
                      we say, an interested third party.

                                  KAFKA
                      I'll bear that in mind.

                      The formality of a trial would be too
                      costly for them.  They're beginning
                      to understand that it's the ensuing

                      The Castle will deny he was there
                      any longer than his business required.
                      They're just file clerks up there.  No
                      doubt he was handed over to the police
                      with the utmost discretion.

                      In any event, we've felt no
                      repercussions as yet.  Eduard must not
                      have talked.  You're the one they
                      contacted.

                                  KAFKA
                      So that's who my foes are -- policemen
                      and file clerks.  Law and order, you
                      might say.

        The Solemn Anarchist looks up from his matchbox.

          The Deputy National Security Advisor, MARILYN RICHARDS,

          the table to her.

          I know that, Marilyn. In fact, we
          just pulled one of our officers
          out and I took the initiative to
          ask him to come down here. He
          infiltrated Hezbollah in Beirut in
          the eighties, won himself some
          nice medals. We're thinking about
          giving him a station.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Standing in front of a fireplace, above which is an
oil painting of the Prime Minister, is the Ambassador
whom we saw at the Albert Hall. He is on the telephone.

                         AMBASSADOR
             Yes...yes...I see. Well if the woman
             won't talk, she won't talk and that's
             that, I suppose. All right.


INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT

Mrs. Drayton closes the door behind the two as Drayton
advances towards the Ambassador with an easy manner,
the CAMERA PANNING him.

                 (Easily)
             Excuse me sir, I have a lot to explain
             to you -- something very unusual has
             happened. I must also have the money
             to pay our French marksman.

                         AMBASSADOR
                 (Almost casually)
             Wouldn't it be superfluous, considering
             that he's dead?

Drayton and his wife stare mutely at the Ambassador.
They are staggered at this news.

                      AMBASSADOR
          His aim wasn't quite as good as you
          led me to expect. The target merely
          received a slight flesh wound in the
          arm. Worse than useless.

Drayton still stares, petrified, at the Ambassador.

                      AMBASSADOR
          Then your French friend panicked, and
          made a fatal crash -- landing on the
          floor of the Albert Hall.

                       DRAYTON
              (Blustering weakly)
          I don't see how you can hold me
          responsible. He was most warmly
          recommended by our people in
          Marrakesh...

The Ambassador now begins to get really nasty.

     The little boy is fascinated by the hairpiece he holds.  He
     turns it over and around, and looks from it to the dead
     man.

     Suddenly the boy turns and runs, away from us, towards the

     bears a story headlined:  GANGSTER SLAIN.  The subhead:

     After a beat the diner drops the paper to the counter, and
     we see that it is Tom, wearing overcoat and hat.  He is
     grimacing at whatever he was reading.  He stands and digs
     into his pocket.

     Beneath this newspaper article are OTHER ARTICLES, all
     concerning Starkey: his crimes, his capture, all of it.

     Mackelway's memory just got stoked again:

35   INT. COURTHOUSE - HALLWAY - RESUMING FLASHBACK                    35

     Mackelway emerges from that courthouse anteroom, whipped.

     The hall's busy with MEDIA and other traffic. First face he
     sees is Fran, who sits on a bench, (wedding ring ON). Her eyes
     say how lousy she feels for him. It almost helps.

36   INT. COURTHOUSE BATHROOM - CONTINUING FLASHBACK                   36

     The door bursts open and Mackelway storms in. No need to look
     composed now; he's alone in here. He crosses to a paper-towel
     dispenser, SLUGS IT. Stares in the mirror.

     He's livid, embarrassed, frustrated - can barely look at his
     own reflection.

     Then he hears LAUGHTER, behind him. He turns.

     Out of the darkness of a badly-lit STALL, Virgil Starkey
     emerges, coming into view under a single light.

     Beside him is a GRIM COP, his chaperone. Starkey passes by
     Mackelway, almost snickering. Then he's gone. Mackelway shuts
     his eyes tight. His head is pounding. END FLASHBACK.

37   INT. HOPE HOUSE - BASEMENT - RESUMING                             37

     Mackelway stares... at a record of his deepest wound. But what
     the hell is it doing in the locker of a transient?

     We've been to this house before. Suburbia.

     Mackelway sits in his car, at the curb, studying the place.
     Rain falls in sheets, wind blows. And there he is, all alone,
     six in the morning, staring at a house.

     That idea - the thought that snapped his eyes open - it's
     still working on him. Beside him is the DRAWING that was found
     in Speck's car:

     The rendering of a steamer-trunk, lined with plastic,
     containing body parts in plastic bags... Mackelway seems to be
     fixated on it now.

     A hand knocks on the front door. Jan Speck opens up.

                    (hoping for good news:)

     Mackelway sits at the WINDOW, looking over the backyard.
     Nothing special out here: some trees, a swing, a storm-cellar
     door.

     But he's staring at it, intently. We're not sure why.

                    The fact is, before the treaty in
                    `72 they were strip mining all
                    over the place down here -- we
                    believe for uranium and other
                    specialized minerals for weapon's
                    use. It was the Cold War. No one

                    Russian's were up to. This plane

                    what's in those cannisters could

                    - if I had told you I was C.I.A.,
                    you would have been on the horn
                    back to Washington in no time.
                    This is a very sensitive matter.

Marion relents.

				MARION
		Very well.

The children turn back to the mob.  Marion joins them.

				THOMAS
		Look!  There's Gabriel!

They see Gabriel making his way through the crowd.  He
sees them and waves, then enters the house.

A moment later Charlotte steps out onto the balcony and
sees:

IN THE SQUARE, a pair of drunk Sons of Liberty, pull down
one of the smoldering effigies, cut off its head, then
start hacking at it's groin with a sword.

Appalled, Charlotte shoots a glare at Marion and snaps at
the children.

				CHARLOTTE
		Children, inside!  All of you!
		Right now.

The children start to protest, but a glance at Charlotte's
resolute expression makes them think better of it.  They
file into the house.  Charlotte shoots a glare at Marion
and shoos the children inside.  Gabriel steps out and
joins them.

				MARION
		What news?

				GABRIEL
		The British army is barricaded in
		Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from
		Virginia, recruiting for a
		Continental Army.

				MARION
		Is that why the Assembly was

		Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and

EXT.  SNOW'S ISLAND - DAWN

The men are beginning to stir, gathering around the
campfires, cooking, using pots, pans and other gear from
the stolen British wagons.

Marion reads Cornwallis' journal.  He looks up, stretches
and walks over to a campfire where Gabriel, Billings and
Rev. Oliver cook.  The dogs follow at a distance.

				BILLINGS
		Well?

				MARION
		I've just been inside the mind of a
		genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more
		about war than I could in a dozen
		lifetimes.

				BILLINGS
		Cheerful news to greet the morn.

				MARION
		His victories at Charleston and
		Camden were perfect, strategically,
		tactically, logistically.  But he
		has a weakness.

They all turn to Marion.

				MARION
		Lord Cornwallis is brilliant.  His
		weakness is that he knows it.

				GABRIEL
		Father?

				MARION
		Pride is his weakness.

The men consider that.

tea.

				ANNE
		Just because the French didn't come
		this fall, doesn't mean they're
		never going to come.

He nods and takes a drink of the tea.  She smiles.
Gabriel smiles back to her, revealing a mouthful of ink-
stained, black teeth.  Before she has time to laugh...

ROLLINS RIDES HARD INTO CAMP.  Marion hurries over,
accompanied by the Great Danes.  The other men gather
around.

				ROLLINS
		They're to be hung!

				GABRIEL
		But they're prisoners-of-war!

Marion isn't as surprised as Gabriel.  He is, however,
taken aback by Gabriel's black teeth.  Gabriel notices
everyone looking at his mouth.

Anne is embarrassed and regretful, seeing her joke fly in
the face of the troubling news.

EXT.  FORT CAROLINA - DAY

A REDCOAT SENTRY sees a lone figure on horseback ride out
of distant woods.  It's Rev. Oliver, carrying a white flag
with one hand, holding a dispatch case in the other.  The
sentry calls to the Commander of the Watch.

				REDCOAT SENTRY
		Sir.

INT.  CORNWALLIS' HEADQUARTERS - FORT CAROLINA - DAY

A temporary HQ has been set up in a commandeered
farmhouse.  Cornwallis stands uncomfortably while a tailor
measures him and marks alterations on a partially
completed uniform.  Tarleton enters.

				TARLETON
		General, a message from the
		commander of the rebel militia.

Cornwallis reads the message.

		Sooner or later that message will
		get through to Cornwallis.

				PINKNEY

				WASHINGTON
		And when the British ships arrive,
		the French ships will flee.  And
		when the French ships flee, General
		Rochambeau and the French troops
		will flee as well.

Marion speaks up.

				MARION
		Then you must let the message go
		through.

They all turn to Marion, most of them looking at him as if
he's insane.

				WASHINGTON
		If Cornwallis receives news that
		Clinton is coming, he'll simply hold
		tight and wait.  He'll fight a
		purely defensive battle and he'll
		win that.

				MARION
		No, he won't.  There are two things
		you need to know about Cornwallis.
		First, he is a very proud man, He
		would rather risk defeat than share
		a victory.
			   (beat)
		If you give him what he thinks is an
		out, he'll take it.

				WASHINGTON
		And what is the second thing?

Marion pulls Cornwallis' journal out of his haversack and
leafs through it.

				MARION
		I'll let him tell you himself...
			   (reading)
		"... but it is this colonial militia
		that is the most irksome.  Not
		worthy of my attention, but
		demanding it; not worthy of British
		blood, but taking it; and not worthy
		of a soldier's honor, but sullying
		it.  Those nights of mine that are
		not sleepless, are filled with
		dreams of a cavalry charge on the
		heels of fleeing farmers..."

Marion closes the journal.

				MARION
		He has no respect for citizen
		soldiers.  That's your bait...
		militia.

Washington nods, considering it.

Too much sympathy, Horace. Writing these riots were a rising against
"unjust laws and unsuitable law-givers." The shame!

          As Pete Reiser steps up into the batter's box...
          Jack stares at Dutch Leonard. Assassin's eyes as he takes an
          insolent, in-your-face lead off first.
          Dutch fires to first. Jack dives back safe!
          Back on his feet, he spits out a piece of grit he picked up
          sliding back on his belly. Not bothering to dust himself
          off, he's turning into something elemental before our eyes.

He's seated in some type of machine. There are lots of buttons and levers on the

negotiating.

wheelchair.

EXT. FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY

IN THE RED SHARK

GONZO grips the wheel - stares maniacally down the road - a
lousy driver.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            The only thing that really worried
            me was the ether.  There is nothing
            in the world more helpless and
            irresponsible and depraved than a
            man in the depths of an ether binge.
            And I knew we'd get into that
            rotten stuff pretty soon.

The radio news wars with "SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL" on a tape
recorder.

                         RADIO NEWS
            An overdose of heroin was listed as
            the official cause of death for
            pretty 19 year old Diane Hanby
            whose body was found stuffed in a
            refrigerator last week...

GONZO changes the station - "ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE, SWEET
JESUS, ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE" vies with "SYMPATHY"... He
sings along - washes a couple of pills back with a new beer.
The RED SHARK fishtails.

Cut to wider shot -- DUKE is holding on to a man standing
next to him at the bar.  The room has returned to normality.
GONZO is sitting in his original position.

                         GONZO
                   (downs his drink --
                   gets up)
            That's the press table.  Where you
            have to sign in for our credentials.
            Shit, let's get it over with.  You
            handle that, and I'll check on the
            room.

            No, no.  Don't leave me!

Black screen.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DUSK

A TELEVISION shows the NIGHTLY NEWS.  A BUDDHIST MONK,
protesting the war, sets himself on fire.  A very nervous
BELL BOY is laying out GONZO's order.  A marlin spike is on
the floor next to DUKE.

                         BELL BOY
            Four club sandwiches, four shrimp
            cocktails.

                         DUKE
            There's a big... machine in the
            sky... some kind of electric snake...

DUKE is curled by the window -- MESMERIZED by an unseen neon
sign outside the window.  His eyes fill with a million
colored lights.

                         BELL BOY
            ... a quart of rum...

                         DUKE
            ... coming straight at us.

            Vitamin C.  We'll need all we can

GONZO sees the BELL BOY out the door -- turns and lays into
DUKE.

                         GONZO
            Look, you've got to stop this talk
            about snakes and leeches and
            lizards and that stuff.  It's
            making me sick!

DUKE stares -- hears the drone of B52 BOMBERS...

On TV: The LAOS INVASION -- A SERIES OF HORRIFYING
DISASTERS -- EXPLOSIONS AND TWISTED WRECKAGE.

Newsreel footage of MAI LAI MASSACRE and the LIEUTENANT

            You bastard!  They'll never let us
            back in that place.  I leave you
            alone for three minutes and you
            start waving that goddamn marlin
            spike around -- yelling about
            reptiles!  You scared the shit out
            of those people!  They were ready
            to call the cops.  Hell, the only
            reason they gave us press passes
            was to get you out of there...

A knock at the door.  DUKE and GONZO break out in a sweat.

                         DUKE
            Oh my God!  Who's that?!

GONZO STICKS HIS GUN IN HIS WAISTBAND -- opens the door to
LACERDA -- BOUNCING WITH PUPPY DOG ENTHUSIASM.  GONZO stares
at a man he instantly hates -- watches him with deep
suspicion.

                         LACERDA
            Duke?  I'm Lacerda your photographer.
            Got your press passes?  Good, good.
            Too bad you missed the bikes

            They like warm weather... You'd

KICKING.  BRUTAL AND UGLY.

            North Vegas is where you go when
            you've fucked up once too often on
            The Strip and when you're not even
            welcome in the cut-rate Downtown

PAN to reveal a seedy diner -- THE NORTH STAR CAFE in the
background.  Through the window -- DUKE and GONZO sit at the
counter.

INT. NORTH STAR COFFEE LOUNGE - NIGHT

            The North Star Coffee Lounge seemed
            like a fairly safe haven from our
            storms.  No hassles, no talk.  Just
            a place to rest and regroup.  I
            wasn't even hungry.

GONZO stuffs a hamburger down PAYING NO ATTENTION TO THE
BEATING going on outside the window.  Duke reads a newspaper.

                         And then she completely pulled back 
                         from death and stood up and put on 
                         her clothes and began to cook for 
                         everyone in the house. The mourners. 
                         And me. And herself! She ate a meal 
                         that would choke a pig!

                                     ROSE
                         That's incredible.

ELLIE moving towards MIKE, she slipping her hand into his

She retrieves her cold coffee cup from the POTTING TABLE,
checks out the picture of CLAIRE in the newspaper, he's
left there.  MIKE adjusts his tie.  It's very colorful.

                         ELLIE
          I read the article.  You didn't tell

          Well, actually, she looks better

her, ending WITH A HUG.

MIKE turns, his face with grease on it.

           she was a beauty; I daresay the
           most elegant girl I've ever seen.
           So tall, with raven hair cascading
           down her back; I don't know how
           she'd had it done. She sang a duet
           with Mr Rochester. They made a
           lovely harmony.

          St John's eyes alight on Jane's charcoal drawing. Jane

                          JANE
           Mr Rochester; how is he?
                         
                          ST JOHN
           I'm ignorant of all concerning him.
                         
          St John opens his pocket book and removes a piece of paper.
                         
           ST JOHN (CONT'D)
           Well, since you won't ask the
           governess's name, I must tell
           you. I have it written down here
           in black and white.
                         
          He hands her the paper. On it are doodled the heads of some
          of her pupils. She has absently written Jane Eyre in the
          margin several times.
                         
           ST JOHN (CONT'D)
           A solicitor named Briggs wrote to
           me of a Jane Eyre. I knew a Jane
           Elliott. This paper resolved my
           suspicion into certainty.

           The solicitor - Mr Briggs - does
           he have any news of Mr Rochester?
                         
                          ST JOHN
           Are you not going to enquire why
           he has gone to such lengths to
           find you?

                          ST JOHN
           Merely to tell you that your uncle,
           Mr John Eyre of Madeira, is dead;
           that he has left you all his
           property and that you are now rich.

Title: Jane Eyre
Genres:
Drama, Romance,

           You are rich; quite an heiress.
                         
          Silence. Jane is flabbergasted.
                         
           ST JOHN (CONT'D)
           Your fortune is vested in the
           English funds; Briggs has the
           will and all the necessary
           documents. You can enter on
           immediate possession.
                         
          At last, Jane looks questioningly up at him.
                         
           ST JOHN (CONT'D)
           Your forehead unbends at last; I
           thought you were turning to
           stone. Perhaps now you will ask
           how much you are worth.
                         
                          JANE
           How much am I worth?
                         
                          ST JOHN
           Oh a trifle. Twenty thousand
           pounds - but what of that?
                         
          The news literally takes Jane's breath away.
                         
                          JANE
           Twenty thousand pounds?
                         
          St John begins to laugh at Jane's reaction. She has never
          seen him laugh before.

                          ST JOHN
           If you'd committed a murder and
           I'd found you out, you could
           scarcely look more aghast.
                         
                          JANE
           There must be some mistake. It's
           two thousand, surely.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           It's twenty. You look desperately
           miserable about it, I must say.
                         
          Jane still cannot take it in. She frowns in disbelief.

               in, flopping his enormous bulk into a nicked and mothy chair. 
               He picks up a newspaper, but his eyes remain on Macreedy. 
               Macreedy waits patiently for the absent clerk. For a moment, 
               he studies the open registration ledger; his eyes rove from 
               the ink-splotched blotter up over the desk to one of those 
               World War II banners, the imitation silk now stained and 
               faded. It depicts a shrieking eagle rampant, clutching The 
               Flag in a claw. Under it, the legend:

          Oh my God... that's unbelievable,
          the poor man. Well here's the
          good news -- I've just arrived in
          Berlin... yes, I've been teaching
          in Leipzig, at the Hochschule fur

          Puts the phone down. A beat. Another look at the airport
          scans of Martin. Studying them a moment.
          Jurgen opens the bowling bag, up-ends it onto the table.
          Bowling shoes, a shirt, a hand towel...
          Taking a knife from the counter, Jurgen cuts around the

          inside. The contents hidden from us... a shadow of tension
          crosses his face. Then a slow, enigmatic smile.

               Mr. Weiss, I was thinkin' about what
               you said, about how all your movies
               have to make a profit.  And I
               realized, what's the one thing, that
               if you put in a movie, it'll be

     INT. SCREENING ROOM - DAY

     Ed is alone in a darkened screening room, depressed.

     Playing on the SCREEN is the last footage of Bela: Bela
     stumbles around in front of his house and smells the flower.

     Ed drinks out of a flask.

     The film runs out.  A VOICE comes over a loudspeaker.

                             VOICE
               Do you want me to run it again?

     Ed silently nods.

     INT. ED'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Ed's apartment has gone to hell.  Ed is in a robe, unshaven and
     clutching a bottle of whiskey.  Newspapers are everywhere.

     Bela's and Ed's dogs eat out of the trash.

     Kathy tries to straighten things up.  Ed stares listlessly.

                             ED
               I'd seen him in a coffin so many

               Ed, you've got to snap out of this.

               I might as well be.  I made shitty

     Kathy reads a newspaper while knitting an angora sweater.  Ed
     is typing deliriously fast -- in one of his artistic fevers.

                             ED
               You know, when you rewrite a script,

                         ANCHOR
               A "race war" has erupted at one of
               the nation's oldest and most
               prestigious institutions.

     Glued to this are our story's subjects, who we meet in...

     TROY FAIRBANKS, 21, Black. He drags a brush through his
     finger waves anxiously. The look of guilt is the only mark
     of imperfection in his privileged and chiseled demeanor.

                         ANCHOR (O.S.)
               Outrage over an "African American
               Themed" party organized by
               predominately white students of
               Manchester University has resulted
               in rioting and property damages.

               Guests were invited to "liberate

               Dear White People, apparently
               Morgan Freeman in "Deep Impact"
               wasn't enough. Despite two terms
               Obama could cure Cancer and
               somewhere White folks will be
               embroiled in protest. And he's only
               half Black.

     hair and "laundry day" flip flop clad ensemble, catches the

          The Times has been watching us like
          a hawk. Last thing we need is some
          "race war" on newspapers across the
          country. How do you think our donor
          base will feel about that? Our fund-

          How bad is this deficit of yours?

                    PRESIDENT FLETCHER
          Worse. But let me tell you
          something. If this blows up any
          further? It's on you Walter. Racism
          is over in America. And if anyone's

                         LIONEL
               But you're not Head of House.

     Still stings. Troy heads into his room and closes the door
     leaving Lionel alone in the living room.

57   INT. ARMSTRONG/PARKER DINING HALL - DAY                      57

     Lionel sits alone in front of another bowl of soup. Eyes the
     different cliques of mostly Black students. Dreads walks past
     and shoots a head nod. Lionel uncomfortably shoots one back.

                         DREADS
               Stay Black, my brother.

                         LIONEL
               Sure thing?

     Lionel watches as Kurt and Troy walk together towards the
     entrance - suddenly chums. Troy's getting good news and
     gladly shakes Kurt's hand.

                         KURT
               Need your submission by Thursday.

                         TROY
               You got it bro.

     The two try and enter, when immediately Dreads slams a GONG
     in the back of the hall - prompting the whole of the dining
     hall to turn and throw paper balls at Kurt.

                           KURT
               The fuck?

     Sam grins from a table comprised of Martin, Sungmi and her
     other support staff. Martin is visibly annoyed.

                           TROY
               Yo!

     Troy takes some of the brunt of this and walks with the
     humiliated Kurt back out of the Dining Hall.

     Lionel watches with a smirk as Troy talks Kurt down on the
     other side of the entrance. Lionel catches eyes with Sam
     briefly who shares the same smirk.

     He realizes Sam's actually looking at Reggie, perched behind
     him at a table flanked by Curls and Dreads. They address him.

     The party is dark and rambunctious. Lots of white kids in
     costume. Some as fairies or ninjas or Spiderman - but most as
     pimps and thugs. As Blaxploitation characters. As Barack
     Obama and Condi Rice. As Shaft, Ice Cube, and 2 Chainz.

     It's a lot for Lionel. Cups are handed to them filled with
     "Purple Drank." Everyone downs the stuff.

     Troy is being appreciated by an ancient COUPLE.

      Lionel watches as Gordon and other Pastiche crew nervously
      put up flyers and posters. They seem caught off guard. Lionel
      glances at the posters - it's Kurt with a large Afro wig
      mimicking Sam's "Missing Black Culture" flyers.

                          LIONEL
                This is kind of fucked up. Right?

          Could you please, before I go,
          say one thing that is supportive?
          Because I've never done anything

          Without Dad, you never did
          anything at all. And i don't

          flips through, finds the obituaries and starts to read.

          Ok. All right. Yeah. Ok, bye.
          Adele hangs up the phone, looks at the paper.

          148EXT. CITY SET (INT. WAREHOUSE SET) - 2031 - DAY 148

          Sammy, walking with a cane, exits his apartment building set
          and walks down the street. Caden and Hazel follow. Sammy
          passes people, nods hello to some. He stops at a newsstand
          and buys a paper. The set seems to go on forever.

          Hazel and Caden watch.

		Bill, after this deal, you'll be

	Parrish smiles, they step into the elevator.

	INT. BONTECOU EXECUTIVE OFFICES - DAY

	Parrish and Drew emerge from the elevator, Parrish observing
	the overkill decor.

			     DREW
		Their PR guy asked me, what did I
		think Parrish Communications stood
		for, that's principle and ethics-
		wise?  I came up with something, but
		then it occurred to me, why don't I
		ask Bill?  What do you think?

	A moment, Parrish shrugs.

			     PARRISH
		Our first annual report, must be
		thirty-five years ago now, I owned
		two stations, I wrote down a state-
		ment of purpose, that one day you
		would wake up to a Parrish radio
		station, read a Parrish paper at
		breakfast, catch our news on tele-
		vision during the day, and go to bed
		with one of our books or magazines
		and you would always be told the
		truth and in the bargain, have a
		good time.

			     DREW
		That's great!  Wait 'til I show it
		to Bontecou.

	Drew opens a door, a conference room, a circle of top exec-
	utives, now stepping out from the group is a huge, white-
	haired man, JOHN BONTECOU, 55.

			     BONTECOU
		Bill, thanks for coming over...
			(to Drew)
		And how're you doing today, Drew?
			(to Parrish)
		You've got a firecracker here, the
		kid's really set the table.

			     PARRISH
		Good, good.  Glad to hear it.

			BONTECOU
		We've met before, y'know, that White
		House function, the President had
		you on his right and you know where

			     QUINCE
		Hi, Ed, hi folks, I didn't know
		everybody was going to be here, what
		a nice surprise.  What's the big
		confab?

			     SLOANE
			(acidly)
		This is a secret meeting.

			     DREW
			(to Quince)
		I hope you'll respect its nature --
		What we're trying to do here is
		gather our thoughts -- in light of
		Bill's rejection of Bontecou's offer
		-- and make an appropriate presenta-
		tion to him as to how we think the
		company might proceed.  Won't you
		share with our Board the information
		you gave me last night?

	Quince hesitates, then realizes what Drew has on his mind.
	He nods confidently to Drew, then turns importantly to the
	Board.

			     QUINCE
		Well, I'm happy to tell you I've got
		good news.  As I was telling Drew,
		I've been making a little hay while
		the Bontecou sun was shining -- two,
		possibly three new and boiling hot
		prospects for merger.

			     DREW
		How did Bill react to the leads
		you've developed?

			     QUINCE
		He was interested.

			     DREW

		-- But he was concerned about the
		timing?

			     QUINCE
		The timing -- yes.  He says it's up
		to Joe.

		I'll be the judge of that.

			     PARRISH
		I'm her father!

			     JOE
		With all due respect, Bill, I'm not
		asking your permission.

			     PARRISH
		Well, you goddam well should.  You
		walk into my life, give me the worst

		on the heads of pins with my busi-

		you're spooning with my daughter.

			     JOE
		'Spooning'?

			     PARRISH
		Yes, and stop repeating everything I

		Spooning, fooling around, God knows
		what.  You arrive on the scene -- why
		you picked me, I still don't under-
		stand --

			     JOE
		I picked you for your verve, your

		- how shall I say - instruct.  You've
		lived a first-rate life.  And I find
		it eminently usable.

	Parrish measures Joe.

			     PARRISH
		What do you want?

	Joe doesn't answer, riveted now on Parrish.

			     PARRISH (cont'd)
		Everybody wants something, Joe.
		You've been taking me from pillar
		to post here.  I thought I knew who
		you were, and it wasn't a whole lot
		of fun, however it was almost bear-
		able.  Now I'm getting something
		else from you, something very, very
		strange -- what is it that you want,
		Joe?

     At a table with a pre-made sandwich and cup of coffee,

      There's a knock. He tucks the list in the Bible, sets
      aside and answers the door. Frode comes in.
                              FRODE
                The good news is he survived. How
                he does now, we have to see. He's in
                ICU. Can I have one of those?
                                                          75.

He points to the table.

                          BLOMKVIST
           A sandwich?
                          FRODE
           A Scotch.
Blomkvist pours him one, and another for himself.

      Cacophony of loud techno and a fringe clientele. Alone
      at a table drinking, Salander seems comfortable with the
      noise and her dateless status, but doesn't avoid a glance
      from an Asian girl at the bar, and doesn't tell her to go
      away when she comes over and motions to the empty chair.

      Salander and the girl from the club, asleep in bed,
      entwined like snakes.

      Salander wakes, disentangles herself, and is padding to
      the bathroom when there's a knock on her door.
      She stares it. No one ever knocks on her door. But
      someone knocks on it again. She crosses to it, wrapping
      herself in a blanket.

                               SALANDER

      Her mind races, as Blomkvist's did to the news someone
      had invaded his privacy. She unlocks the door. Cracks
      it enough to see him. He smiles, but it's disconcerting.
      She's not sure it's a harmless one.

      hear the knock at the front door, nor -

                I have some very upsetting news.

                last night.

The picture has, once again, tumbled from its spot.  She
drops to her knees over the picture.  This time THE GLASS IS
SHATTERED.  When she picks out the remaining shards, the
newspaper photo slides out.  Claire glances at the benign
news stories on the back.

She looks around and spots a piece of glass wedged in a crack
in the floor boards by the knot.

CLAIRE'S POV

The piece of glass, wedged next to what looks like A COPPER
COIN in the crack.  It's too big to be a penny.

She tries to use the piece of glass to pry it free, but
recoils.  A tiny drop of blood appears on her finger, which
she pops into her mouth.

Claire peers around, frustrated, half waiting for a reply.
There is only silence.  She reaches in to pull the plug,
nearly scalding her hand.  When she turns for a hand towel
she finds a message traced into the steamed-up mirror:

                      "YOU KNOW"

She draws in a breath and darts out of the bathroom.

                      with multiple agendas, that run up the
                      chain of command through me. Intel came
                      forth at the eleventh hour that Naseem

           OFF HARRY
           ...After having written five dramas, I had finally
           managed to write a script for a comedy, or that's what
           I thought. I wanted to change genres... to take a risk
           (ironic-destructive) And I swear I accomplished that,
           the part about taking a risk.

          

          
          In 1994, everyone calls Harry "Mateo". He is sitting behind a table
          filled with papers, photographs, books, magazines, an ashtray, pencil
          and pen holders, etc. At its center, a script lies open, with tons of
          notes scribbled on the margins of its pages. He is finishing the
          definitive version of "Girls and Suitcases".

          

          
          The casual messiness of the place produces its own aesthetic. The
          only decorations on the walls, here and there, not following any
          particular symmetrical rule, are postcards of painters, actors or
          landscapes, held in place by tacks. There is also a newspaper page
          that has caught Mateo's attention. Or some astonishing photograph,
          taken from a magazine. The cover of some magazine. Everything without
          framing, tacked directly onto the wall.
          The furniture is pastel, medium-shade green or red, with velvet
          tapestry, worn and outmoded. The pieces don't match, but they look
          good together.

          

          
          Judit enters (also fourteen years younger, but this is less obvious.
          She is a woman unmarked by the march of time.)
          Mateo is focused on the script's pages. Judit is Mateo's right-hand
          man, they are accomplices in everything, both professionally and
          emotionally.

          A few surfers are preparing to go into the ocean. A father and his
          young son toss their kites into the wind.
          Lounging on lounge chairs, on a cobble-stone area before one reaches
          the sand, Lena and Mateo-Harry are reading the news of the opening of
          the film in a National newspaper. They only have one copy and Mateo's
          eyes are transfixed on the news.
          The note accompanying the event says, in bold type:
          "The financier, Ernesto Martel, has managed to gather all of Madrid
          for his first film as a producer, missing are only its director and
          star."
          Two pictures accompany the news of the event. Printed next to them,
          there is a review entitled, "Disaster."
          Mateo throws the newspaper away from him, enraged. He refuses to read
          the review.

          The wind dishevels the newspaper pages. Lena rises and chases the
          pages that fly, like kites, slightly above the ground.
          In mid-flight, she catches the Entertainment page and reads it as she
          approaches Mateo, who watches the ocean, feeling impotent, furious,
          unable to quite grasp what is happening.
          Lena sits down next to him, still reading.

          A man named ARLINGTON STEWARD (40) is standing there, his
          body is turned in profile. He is wearing a crisp wool suit
          and a BLACK HAT, with a BRIEFCASE in his right hand.

          Arlington then rotates his body... revealing the RIGHT SIDE
          of his face. Norma's eyes widen in horror at what she sees.
          Nearly all of the right side of his face from his cheekbone
          to his lower jaw has been burned away. His rear MOLARS and
          GUMS are exposed beneath the absence of tissue that is
          supposed to conceal them.
          Norma immediately feels a strange connection... a deep
          sympathy for him and the pain he must have endured.

               Haphazardly pulled-up over the steps and the FIRETRUCKS 
               already unspooling their hoses. Cops, Firemen, EMT's. 
               Everybody's SCREAMING. Hub and Elise race past.

               MAN IN BLACK TIE

               Sits, weeping quietly beneath the once proud stone lions.

               THE FEW SURVIVORS

               Their faces cut and bleeding, stumble around, disoriented. 
               As Hub and Elise continue toward a SOUND we have never heard 
               before in this country. A kind of keening.

               A NYPD SERGEANT is the senior OFFICER on the scene. Hub shows 
               his shield to the man who appears a bit shell-shocked.

sitting by a radio or television now. I'm told the President is on his way

	purple, right before our eyes; his tongue hangs out, in a

Ben has adapted what would have been a maid's room into
his study and the adjoining room into a do-it-yourself
workshop.
The study has photographs of Ben's past as a provincial
rugby player, of his family, school staff and TRECHIKOFF
reproduction.
On a cupboard are trophies of individual sports at
university.
He works off a plain desk on which is a handsome pipe-
rack with several pipes. His indulgence is a comfortable
easy chair.
Ben's study, containing only the figure of Ben. He's
hunched over his desk, looking blankly at the newspaper.
His shirt is unbuttoned, his jacket slung across his
chair. He draws heavily on his pipe, wreathing his
head with smoke in the beam of the single desk light.
He sits in his chair:

Gordon's voice rises in his thoughts.
                           GORDON (V.O.)
             That day, Mister Ben, sir, when
             they whipped Jonathan, you also
             said we can do nothing. God as my
             witness today: I must know what
             happened and where he lies. His
             body belongs to Emily and me.
He mutters -- more a prayer than a curse.

                           BEN
             Jeezus -- Jeezus -- Jeezus Christ.
                           JOHAN
             Good night, Papa!

Susan exclaims in angry frustration and flees.

Stanley appears at the garage door.     He stands.
                           STANLEY
             Gordon's dead.

                          BEN
             What?
The news leaves Ben speechless.      Stanley continues in
flat, emotionless tones.
                           STANLEY
             The bastards say he committed
             suicide... hanged himself.

Ben, recovering from the shock.
                           BEN
             Suicide... is that what they told
             Emily -- poor woman...
                           STANLEY
             They didn't tell her. She heard
             it on the radio like the rest of
             us. I contacted Lewinson
             immediately. He then rung the
             police to ask why Emily wasn't
             informed. Would you believe it,
             they said they were sorry, and they
             didn't know where to contact her.
Ben walks slowly out of the garage in deep thoughts --
Stanley follows him.

                            STANLEY
             Okay.   It was a simple question.
Stanley turns his RADIO ON and BANTU MUSIC invades the
car as it speeds away in a cloud of dust.
EXT. WHITE SUBURB STREET - LATE AFTERNOON
The big brassy Dodge is threading its way through the
leafy calm of the white suburb.

The "Bantu" MUSIC is STILL PLAYING on the radio under
Stanley's animated conversation with Ben.

                           STANLEY
             You know, Lanie, when you run a
             taxi, especially a pirate taxi
             like me, you have eyes and ears
             everywhere. Even when a policeman
             farts in his bed you know. People
             want a reference book, a permit to
             stay in Soweto, a house, anything,
             we taxi drivers know the routes.
             I'll tell you something...

A news bulletin in African language interrupts the music.
Stanley listens.

EXT. APPROACHES OF SOWETO - AFTERNOON
Stanley drives seemingly alone at very high speeds, which
he maintains through the streets of Soweto... using his
horn to scatter people out of his way, to the anger and
indulgence of others.

The CAR SCREECHES to a halt outside Emily's house.
Stanley gets out of the car and greets the startled
neighbors... and acknowledges the friendly shouts of
children.

Stanley looks around, then goes back to the car, opens
the back door, leans and says something. Suddenly, to
everyone's astonishment, Ben crawls out of the car;
Stanley hustles him into Emily's house.

Stanley waves at the people, a sign of assurance, then
closes the door behind him.

INT. DAN PIENAAR SCHOOL - MORNING
The staff is having coffee during morning break in the
staff room. The room has several easy chairs, a table with
the morning newspapers on it. The walls have pictures of
South African scenes.
There are several conversations in Afrikaans.   This is the
first morning since the photograph.

Ben walks into the staff room. The conversations stop.
Everyone looks at him with hostility. The teachers all
place their cups on the table and quietly file out of
the room.
Ben pours himself a cup of coffee; as he takes his first
sip, Cloete looks in, sees him. He walks in.

             Bloody hell! Stanley, what's
             wrong with you?

Stanley shoves Ben off, and glares at him, bloodshot eyes
breathing heavily.
                           STANLEY
             Emily is dead.

Ben stares at him in stunned disbelief.
                            BEN
             Emily dead?   How?   When?
Stanley doesn't answer - he cries.

Ben grabs him by the shoulders and shakes him.
                           BEN
             What happened, Stanley?      Oh, my
             God. Please tell me.
                           STANLEY
                    (between two sobs)
             A broken heart. All they said.

Ben's hand still on Stanley's shoulder, he sits slowly
beside him, shaken, his face ravaged by the news.

                           BEN
             God.
Through the window, he sees Suzette and Chris carrying
suitcases, back down the path to his in-laws' car;
Father-In-Law shepherding his wife and an ashen, dazed
Susan, helping them into the car.

As they leave see Johan leaning against the dining room
door, watching his father and Stanley.

Stanley produces from his jacket pocket a newspaper --

Before him, scattered on the table: the affidavits he
collected, the Hassiem report, cuttings of articles by
Melanie in the Rand Daily Mail about Jonathan, newspaper
pictures of Gordon, of Seroke, of himself with Emily, the
half-burnt "peace painting" of Picasso, half-burnt photo
of Ben with Suzette, a staff photograph, Ben amongst it,
and a charred trophy.

Ben starts putting material relevent to his inquiries
into a large brown envelope.

Johan enters kitchen with a large envelope and hands it
to his father.
                           JOHAN

INT. TALLEY'S CAR -- NIGHT

Talley slides into his car outside Mrs. Pena's home.  He's
got a lot on his mind, and not all of it centers around 455
Castle Way.  He punches a number into his cell phone --

He listens to ringing, and then his own voice answers --

                     TALLEY'S VOICE MESSAGE
           This is Jeff Talley.  Leave your name and
           number after the beep.

We hear the beep, then --

               (into his phone)
           Jane?  If you're there, pick up, okay?

INT. TALLEY'S CAR -- NIGHT

Suddenly, two masked men point guns at his head, one from the
driver's side, one from the passengers.  They're wearing
jackets, black ski masks, and gloves.  The man on the
passenger side sports a big gold Rolex, so we'll call him the
Watchman --

                     THE WATCHMAN
               (meaning the gun)

Talley pockets his phone.  He watches the ambulance pull
away, then strides back through the banks of lights to the

Talley's voice echoes across the neighborhood.  Every cop in
the cul-de-sac stares at him.  He has addressed the house
for, apparently, no reason.  Dennis shouts from his window --

Curious, JACOB pokes at it. Instantly a terrifying figure pops out from

back, stunned. It is a moment before he realizes that he is looking at

     What do we do now?

PUPKIN is looking    at a picture of an American Gothic couple
standing in front    of a wood-frame house. As he comments on
the pictures, the    CAMERA PANS over them. They form a kind
of slide-show of    LANGFORD's life.

     These are Jerry's parents. His father
     runs the Post office in Wolverine --
     that's in North Dakota.

PUPKIN then fixes on a picture of an eleven-year-old boy
standing next to a puppet stage with a puppet (obviously
held by the boy) staring at its master.

                 PUPKIN
     This one was in Newsweek. He started
     giving these puppet shows when he was
     still in grade school.

     They turn onto a residential street of low houses and well-
     groomed lawns.

     It's all familiar to Ma yet utterly strange: a crowd of media
     (national and international) is set up across the road from
     her house behind temporary barricades. There are neighbors
     and well-wishers carrying helium balloons, flowers, toys, and
     signs. POLICE keep order.

     manages an apologetic smile and half-wave to the neighbors
     who are watching from their own yards.

     RESIDENT AGENT leans in the driver's window to address Ma.

     stumbles, almost falls. Now they're outside they can hear a
     news helicopter overhead: it sounds like a war zone. Nancy
     joins them, taking Jack's hand, and they rush for the front

                And put a cuppa bleach in, next
                time through.

As Quoyle gazes at his benefactor, the woman sneaks up, SNATCHES
his Help Wanted ads. Races them over to her dryer. As the boys
watch, she shoves them in, starts the machine with Quoyle's coins,
and glares fiercely back at us. A mother bear protecting her cubs.
Partridge chuckles. Holds out his hand...

                             PARTRIDGE
                Partridge.

Quoyle glances at the little man's cold fowl supper.

                           QUOYLE
                Uh.   No thanks.

                          PARTRIDGE
                It's my name.

Oh.

INT. MOCKINGBURG RECORD CITY ROOM - DAY

Shabby one-floor newspaper. Old equipment, listless personnel,
stale you can smell from here. Only guy working is Partridge, who
is laying out the front page, and glances up to see across the
floor...

...Quoyle enter in his best suit. It is also his worst suit.
Partridge points to the only enclosed office, and gives his buddy a
hearty thumbs-up. Quoyle nods, his smile a rictus, his eyes a
glaze of panic. We see now that he is chewing, somehow. On the
way into the office, he snags a doughnut from a paper plate by the
coffee. Enters...

INT. ED PUNCH'S OFFICE - DAY

...ED PUNCH, managing editor, looks up from a reverie with a
startled expression. He wears really thick glasses which MAGNIFY
his eyes, giving him a frightening aspect.

                             PUNCH

                 Quoyle?     You're early.

From the rear, we see Quoyle can barely squeeze himself into the
chair.

                           PUNCH
                 I don't like that.

All the change SPILLS out of Quoyle's pockets, and CLATTERS onto
the wood floor, ROLLING interminably, as Quoyle fidgets.

                            Very complicated, Holiness.
                            Let me tell you current news.

                            The Chinese have launched a deceptive
                            campaign aimed at convincing the
                            world that Tibet belongs to China.

                            We sent a mission to the Chinese
                            National Conference.  Our attendance
                            was a grave mistake.  The Tibetans
                            were introduced as delegates from the
                            "Chinese region of Tibet".
                            We protested this reference and
                            demanded a letter rebutting it.

                                      TENZIN GYATSO
                            Did you receive the letter?

                                      KASHAG MEMBER
                            We did not.

                                      LORD CHAMBERLAIN
                            The war is over.
                            This is a time in when nations are
                            redefining themselves.

                                      TENZIN GYATSO
                            So, Tibet, too, needs to define
                            itself.

                            Most of the Chamdo region is
                            now in Chinese hands.  There is
                            a report from Chamdo which makes
                            quite clear that, unless some
                            settlement can soon be reached,
                            Communist troops will soon be
                            marching on Lhasa.

                                      KASHAG MEMBER
                            I am afraid.

                            I want at all costs to avoid this.
                            Do we have news from the delegation
                            in China?

                            Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo,
                            Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must
                            negotiate and offers to go to Peking.

                                      LORD CHAMBERLAIN
                            Your prime minsters would argue
                            that such negotiations should take
                            place in Lhasa.

                            And then they would concede that the
                            times are desperate and we must go
                            to Peking.  Agreed.  Send Ngabo.

                 I was the only one who survived the
                 shipwreck, so the Japanese shipping
                 company sent two men to talk to me
                 in the Mexican hospital where I was
                 recovering. I still have a copy of
                 their report.

                 why the ship sank. They didn't
                 believe me either.

       Pi hands the notebook to the Writer. On top, there is a
       newspaper article with the headline "BOY RESCUED: 227 DAYS IN
       THE PACIFIC." The Writer unclips the article, revealing the
       insurance report beneath. We hear Okamoto's first line over

               Someone has also brought him a newspaper. There's an

             We should probably get you to a
             hospital. Barris poisoned you. It
             was really Barris, we were interested
             in. That's why we set up the

               New York magazine. The cover is partly obscured by her hand
               but we can see a blurry black-and-white photo of a man
               hurrying along a street with a newspaper over his face,
               shielding himself from the camera. Over the photo, three
               words visible: THE PHANTOM WHO -- A second line of type is

               The street is deserted. Nicky holds the newspaper over his
               face for protection. Each man has an arm in the air, trying
               to hail a taxi. They are standing near a trash receptacle

               A bus comes down the street with a large horizontal ad
               covering its right side. It is the same ad -- five of them
               actually, five "New York Magazine" covers side by side.
               Elliot is trying to hail a cab and doesn't notice the ad. As

               newspaper from his face and getting a clear look at the five
               photos on the side of the bus -- a man concealing his face
               with a newspaper.

     Chris and the kayak are in the back of a pick-up truck
     heading down river by road. We pass the Hoover Dam.

                            CARINE (V.O.)
               It would be Christmas in a couple of
               months. And the last news we'd had was
               about his car being found. I woke up a
               couple of days ago, and for the first
               time, I was surprised to realize that it
               wasn't only my parents who hadn't heard
               from Chris. I wondered why he hadn't
               tried to call in case I might answer. He
               could've hung up if it wasn't me.


88   EXT. COLORADO RIVER, TOPOCK, ARIZONA - DAY                  88

     Chris is re-stocked on some food items which he packs in
     his bag and shoves into the bow of the kayak. This lower
     stretch of the river has little in common with the
     unbridled torrent that explodes through the Grand Canyon.
     Emasculated by dams and diversion canals, the lower
     Colorado burbles indolently from reservoir to reservoir,
     through some of the hottest, starkest, most austere
     country on the continent.

                But why he didn't send a letter, maybe
                through a friend. I got mad. But I told
                myself it was good. It made me remember
                that there was something more than
                rebellion, more than anger that was
                driving him. Chris had always been
                driven, had always been an adventurer.
                When he was four years old...

EXT.  MILITARY COURTYARD - CUXHAVEN - DAY

The Cuxhaven troops are drawn up to receive a new
regiment, arrived from England.

Roderick sees, marching at the head of his company, his
old friend, Captain Grogan, who gives him a wink.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Six weeks after we arrived in
	Cuxhaven, we were reinforced by
	Gales regiment of foot from England,
	and I promise you the sight of
	Grogan's face was most welcome to
	me, for it assured me that a friend
	was near me.

INT.  GROGAN'S QUARTERS - DAY

Roderick and Grogan.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Grogan gave me a wink of
	recognition, but offered no public
	token of acquaintance and it was not
	until two days afterwards that he
	called me into his quarters, and
	then, shaking hands with me
	cordially, gave me news which I
	wanted, of my family.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith,
	you've begun early, like your
	father's son, but I think you could
	not do better than as you have done.
	But why did you not write home to
	your poor mother?  She has sent
	half-a-dozen letters to you in
	Dublin.

			RODERICK
	I suppose she addressed them to me
	in my real name, by which I never
	thought to ask for them at the post
	office.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	We must write to her today, and you
	can tell her that you are safe and
	married to "Brown Bess."

Roderick sighs when Grogan says the word "married," on
which Grogan says with a laugh:

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	I see you are thinking of a certain
	young lady at Duganstown.

			RODERICK
	Is Miss Dugan well?

Arrival of Mr. Newcombe, the money-broker.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had hired a money-broker
	especially to find some means of my
	making a loan.  After several months
	without success, it was with some
	considerable interest that I
	received his visit.

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick and the money-broker, Mr. Newcombe.

			NEWCOMBE
	I have good news for you, Mr.
	Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle
	and Chatwick, in the city of London,
	are prepared to lend you 20,000
	pounds, pledged against your
	interest in the Edric mines.  They
	will redeem the encumbrances against
	the property, which amount to some
	10,000 pounds, and take a twenty-
	year working lease on the mines.
	They will lend you the 20,000 pounds
	against the lease income,
	which they will apply to the loan as
	it comes in, and they will make a
	charge of 18% per annum interest on
	the outstanding loan balance.

			RODERICK
	Mr. Newcombe, I have made some
	difficult loans during the past few
	years, at very onerous terms, but
	18% a year interest seems very stiff
	indeed.

			NEWCOMBE
	Considering your financial
	circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has
	been impossible to find anyone at
	all prepared to do any business with
	you.  I think you may count yourself
	lucky to have this opportunity.
	But, obviously, if you would reject
	this offer, I shall keep trying to
	find a better one.

			RODERICK
		   (after a pause)
	I am prepared to accept the terms,
	Mr. Newcombe.

			NEWCOMBE
	There are a few other points we
	should discuss.  The loan agreement
	can only be executed by her
	ladyship's signature, and provided
	that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be
	assured of her ladyship's freewill
	in giving her signature.

The previous voice over sentence ends on a close-up of the folded

The camera moves up from the desk, on which the newspaper is
lying, to Allison's face, who is speaking over the telephone.
Around her, we see other desks with people working.

       This is creepy.

The elevator door slides into the wall, and the two girls get in
the cabin. Allison wants to close the inner door of the cabin, but
it does not want to slide back into closed position.

       Sometimes this gets stuck and you have to use this
       screwdriver.

She takes a screwdriver hanging on a chain in the cabin. With it,
she works on the door lock, and succeeds in moving it.

While she rolls the inner telescopic door shut, she discovers that
another tenant has come into the cabin behind their back. He
doesn't look very friendly, with his bow-tie and his small
mustache. He is holding a newspaper.

       Excuse me.

When the inner door is completely shut, the outer door slides

          On the radio, the EVENING NEWS.
                         
          SCENE 39 - INT. BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          With expert gestures, a nurse shows Georges how to lie Anne
          down and put an incontinence pad on her. She's now almost
          incapable of moving, and has to be turned over like an
          object, as tears flow silently down her face.
                         
          SCENE 40 - INT. LIVING ROOM -DAY
                         
          Anne is at the piano and plays the piece from the Scene 3. We
          watch her and listen to her for a while.
                         
          Georges is seated in his armchair and looks at the piano.
          Finally he leans over toward the CD player and stops it. The
          MUSIC suddenly stops. Georges remains silently seated.
                         
          SCENE 41 - INT. KITCHEN - HALLWAY - BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          He prepares a bowl of muesli, fills a sipping cup with water
          and brings both into the bedroom. Sits down on the bed close
          to Anne to feed her her food.
                         
                          GEORGES
           There, my love, I hope you like it.

               apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table,
               lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then

               I recruited him actually. In

               talk. What did he say to you?

                         LACON
               He said he had some intelligence
               for Control. Had no idea he was
               dead. The news obviously hadn't
               reached Wonga Wonga land. Then he
               said he would only tell it to
               someone outside the Circus. If he
               couldn't have a Minister, he would
               settle for the Under-secretary.
               Lucky me.

               the top of the Circus. And that
               he's been there for years.

     Smiley absorbs this. The moment is suddenly broken by a few
     stray notes from the piano. The two jump slightly and turn to
     where Jackie sits at the keyboard, smiling triumphantly.

VITO CORLEONE is a shy young man of 23, holding his hat in

VIEW ON THE STAGE

A tattered melodrama is in progress in Neapolitan.  The sets
are two-dimensional, and flap whenever there's an entrance
or exit.

The hero, PEPPINO, is weeping as he sings about how he's
left his Mother in Italy, while he is in this new country,
America.

VIEW ON THE AUDIENCE

All poor, Italo-Americans.  Genco finds a few seats, and
leads Vito to them, stepping on a few shoes in the process.
They have barely come to their seats, when an excited Genco
nudges Vito, and points to the stage.  People shout that
they should sit down.

VIEW ON THE STAGE

There is a knock on the door, and a young girl enters,
delivering a letter to Peppino in his tenement in America.
The girl is pretty; and obviously the object of Genco's
affection.  The letter brings bad news.  Peppino's Mother is
dead.  He weeps, and sings the final song, which most of the
audience knows: SENZA MAMMA.

Genco is enthralled with the young actress.  The people in
the audience are singing along with Peppino.

          half of his mother's things into boxes--and then stopped.
          Billy doesn't use the bedroom. He sleeps on the couch among
          boxes of pictures, papers, teacups wrapped in newspaper.
          BILLY is sitting on the couch. He reaches into a box and lays
          out photographs like cards. Scenes from his life. His former
          life. His family life, his life as a child, his romantic
          life. He sits and stares at the pictures. He rearranges the
          photographs in different ways.

EXT. SWIMMING POOL - MEXICO CITY - DAY

Underwater as Pinta swims. As she spins, kicks off the
wall, it's Creasy who comes out the other side. A plume
of red blossoming off his side.

This is done over and over, faster and faster, closer and
closer. The blood becomes darker, bigger. And we push
into that blood until it's finally obscuring everything.

EXT.   NEWSSTAND - MEXICO CITY - EARLY MORNING

A row of newspapers being set out.     Creasy's face on the
front page of every one of them.

EXT.   NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - MORNING

A quaint old Mexico neighborhood. We follow a long
canvas bag being carried through the streets. Carried by
Creasy. Toward the end of the street and a ground floor
apartment. Walks past a canary yellow Coup deVille,
which has seen better days.

INT.   GROUND FLOOR APARTMENT - MORNING

An elderly couple eating lunch. The HUSBAND looks over
at a knock on the door. He stands, answers it. Creasy
slides in, eases the door shut behind him. Gun in hand.

                          CREASY
             I'm not here to hurt you. I need to
             borrow your house and your car. Are you
             the proud owners of the Coupe deVille?

EXT.   JUDICIAL COMPOUND - MORNING

A military operation as Tazinari is led out to his car.
Two heavy gray sedans wait. Tazinari gets in the back of
the second car with his AIDE-DE-CAMP. The door is shut
behind them.

he sees the only person  waiting for him   is Manzano. As
Manzano smiles.

EXT.   ROCK WALL HOUSE - MEXICO CITY - DAY

A tiered house built into the rock face that runs through
Mexico City. A scooter is parked. A man sits on it
waiting, wearing a crash helmet to hide his now well
known features. Creasy.

CREASY - VIDEO FEED

It's difficult to say where they are coming from. The
view passes from one screen to another. As Creasy's
passes, we hear the whispered crackle of radio
communications.

GROUND LEVEL

CREASY sits up as a car pulls up, and a MAN gets out.
Creasy checks the digital "8x10" even though this face is
indelibly imprinted on his brain.

It's not "The Dreamer."    Not as handsome, but there's a
resemblance.

The MAN unlocks the front door, checks the street first
and then enters.

Creasy regroups mentally and physically. Checks the
magazine in his SIG SAUER. Chambers rounds into his
shotgun. Looks up and sees a six-year-old on a bicycle
approach the front door. A ten-year-old opens the door
from inside. The six-year-old struggles to get his
bicycle through the doorway.

Creasy moves. He holds the shotgun against his leg as he
strides across the street. "Man on Fire."

The bicycle makes it in.    And the door is closing...

Creasy gets a foot in, forces his way inside.

      It's a sunny afternoon. We see Marc handcuffed to criminals
      being led onto a white bus that reads: County of Los Angeles
      Sheriff's department.

      Marc sits next to a big, hard-looking criminal.

      CLOSE ON Marc's face as he looks out the window, while the
      bus pulls away. Light streams in on his pale face. He looks
      out as the Los Angeles streets go by.

      Cut back to Marc's young face looking out the window, music
      starts, and the bus drives out of frame.

                We're here with Nicki Moore, who

                involvement in the Bling Ring, and

                victims- Lindsay Lohan. There were
                reports that Lindsay was crying,
                with you being next to her, did you
                actually hear any of this?

                I could hear her crying the first
                day, which is hard when you're
                trying to be strong, I just tried
                to really keep to myself..., I just
                tried to get through the day , the

		What do you mean?

			ABBOT
		When we left Earth seventy years ago, it
		was on the brink of a New Dark Age.
		Technology was on the verge of destroying
		the planet's environment.  A computer virus
		was threatening to wipe away all recorded
		knowledge.  There didn't seem to be any
		way it could be averted.  In the almost
		forty years since we were towed out here
		in hypersleep, the news that came with 
		occasional supply ships only got worse.
		Finally, the ships stopped coming.  We 
		had to resign ourselves to the fact that
		worst had come to pass, and the Earth
		no longer existed.

Now she gives him that look.

		    (slowly)
		Uh...All right... Forget the Earth - How

A new look overtakes the Abbot's face.  A look of fear.  
Now she's getting to him - or is she?
He abruptly stands.

		Your mind is troubled.  You need to rest

SUPER: PATERSON, NEW JERSEY. 1943. ONE YEAR EARLIER.

Over a strip of working-class row homes, we hear the sounds
of a radio announcer giving a dispatch from the war front.

                    RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          American daylight bombers were busy
          again, as our liberators with
          fighter escort continue the air
          offensive with another sock at
          German coastal installations in
          France.


INT. GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT

The radio continues playing to a modest home. We see a young
man cleaning house, sweeping in the background.

                    RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          But the Germans report a big new
          red army push toward Romania. This
          is World War news.

As the war report ends, a stuffy musical piece begins. We
hear a groan from the young man.

From out of the background emerges Allen Ginsberg (now 17,
fresh-faced, horn-rimmed glasses, dutiful son). The kind of
kid who takes care of everything.

He storms up to the radio, switches the station to a fast-
paced boogie-woogie number. He smiles and dances joyfully to
the up-beat number with his broom.

The door slams. Allen looks up, caught in the act, to see his
father LOUIS (40's, school teacher, Jewish working-class
poet) home from work. Allen accidentally drops the broom.

                    LOUIS
          How was she today?

Louis turns off the music. The playful mood dies. Allen spots
the mail in his father's hand.

                    ALLEN
          Fine. Anything for me?

                    LOUIS
          Why? You expecting something?

Allen looks down, a bad liar.

Back in the Ginsberg residence, but the house is quiet now,

Allen, shirt untucked, composing a poem on the back of a

They both reach for their cigarettes at the same time.

Louis looks at Allen writing. A mirror between father and
son. A moment of warm appreciation.

Louis hands Allen a package from the mail pile.

                    LOUIS
          This came for you today.

The package is from Columbia University. Allen opens it,
mystified as to what it might be.

It's his manuscript.

On it, a note: "Walt Jr.: Keep this, Keep Going. - Professor
Steeves."

          But with death comes rebirth.

The camera searches through the crowd to find Allen smoking
in a banquette towards the rear of the bar, dressed-down,
scruffy - a hint of the man he will soon become.

He is joyous, writing in his journal.

The camera then pans past Allen, up and across the old
college photos on the wall.

We find a framed newspaper article on the Columbia's football
team's latest victory.

In the corner of the article, we see a familiar face.

As we move closer, we can read the edge of the headline
reads: "HONOR SLAYING."

The face belongs to Lucien Carr, staring down, frozen in
time.

Lucien is now on the wall.

Alm�sy is HANDCUFFED to the metal grille of the goods compartment.  
He's lying down amongst a bunch of other prisoners and their little 
bundles of possessions in this makeshift cell - some Arabs, some 
Italians.

A SERGEANT pushes a lavatory-bound prisoner along the corridor, leaving 
behind A YOUNG PRIVATE who sits on a packing case, with a rifle across 
his lap, reading a Penguin edition of Gulliver's Travels.  Alm�sy is in 
complete despair to be on the train.  He tries to move, but he's locked 
tight to the grille.  He rattles the cuffs against the metal.

The Soldier pushes Alm�sy along the corridor.  They arrive outside the 
lavatory.  The Soldier is distracted for a split second.  Enough for 
Alm�sy to ELBOW HIM savagely in the stomach, winding him, then he KICKS 
HIM REPEATEDLY in the head.  He wraps his cuffs around the Soldier's 
neck and - yanking them together and twisting - produces a tiny, 
efficient and sickening snap.

He finds the KEY to the handcuffs, unlocks them, grabs the soldier and 
drags him into the empty lavatory.

EXT - GUADALOUPE CANYON - MAGIC HOUR

Old Man Clanton leads 4 other Cowboys with a herd through the 
rocky canyon, slipping a flask and singing as the first shot 
RINGS OUT from the rocks above, becoming a FUSILLADE.  When 
the dust settles, all are dead except the Old Man who lies 
pinned under his horse, semi-conscious.  FIGURES emerge from 
the shadows.  It's the Rurales led by the same Young Rurale 
from before.  He bends down to the dazed Old Man, speaking 
carefully:

                     YOUNG RURALE
          The old one you kill.  This was my father.

          What, and I'm supposed to
          Tremble?  Kiss my ass, Messican.

Hissing gleefully, he jams a derringer under the Young 
Rurale's chin and FIRES, blowing off his sombrero as he falls.  
The other Rurales fire, emptying their guns into the Old Man 
as if he were some monstrous rattlesnake that might bite 
them....

Curly Bill, Ringo, and the others are by the fire, passing a

          Old Man Clanton's dead!  Ambushed 
          In Guadaloupe Canyon.  Messican's
          Got him.

In tight on Curly Bill as the news sinks in.  He clenches his 
fist in rage, then bites a knuckle, getting his control back.

          All right, first thing's first:

          Carnegie is such an impassioned and inspiring speaker it's
          almost impossible not to get caught up and swept away by his
          words. His apparently unshakable belief is infectious.
          
                               CARNEGIE
                    In the meantime, He has asked us
                    all to be patient. To walk the hard
                    road of the faithful just a little
                    longer. And to do that, we must
                    give just a little more.

                    Water rations will be halved until
                    further notice.
          
          This sends a much broader ripple of discontent through the
          crowd - this news has not been received well at all. Some
          still "keep the faith" but many more are perturbed by this.
          
          Carnegie motions for the crowd to settle down.
          
                              CARNEGIE
                    I understand your frustration. The
                    road to salvation is a difficult
                    one - but what lies at the end of
                    that road is a greater glory,
                    beyond anything you can imagine.
          
          A DISCONTENTED VILLAGER steps forward, pushing through the
          crowd and jabbing his finger angrily up at Carnegie.

                            JUDGE
                  No matter -- Come, walk home with me.
                  I have news for you, my friend. In
                  order to shield her from the evils of
                  this world, I have decided to marry my
                  dear Johanna.

                            BEADLE
                  Ah, sir, happy news indeed.

                            JUDGE
                  Strange, though, when I offered myself
                  to her she showed a certain ...
                  reluctance.

     The Beadle proceeds with exquisite and obsequious delicacy:

                            BEADLE
                  Excuse me, my lord,
                  May I request, my lord,
                  Permission, my lord, to speak?
                  Forgive me if I suggest, my lord,
                  You're looking less than your best, my lord,
                  There's powder upon your vest, my lord.
                  And stubble upon your cheek,
                  And ladies, my lord, are weak.

     As they round a corner, the Judge feels his chin:

                            JUDGE
                  Stubble, you say? Perhaps at times I
                  am a little overhasty with my morning
                  ablutions...

     We see Frank's face. This may just have taken years off
     his life. He holds his hand out straight, palm downwards,

     The office is filled with congratulatory balloons and

     is taking congratulatory phone messages at a desk in the

     with a large basketed floral arrangement.

     Spector confronts Frank across his desk.

      whole new adrenaline level.
      Rachel walks among them, moving swiftly, evaluating the
      bodies displayed before her in words and expressions,

     Willie bursts out into crazed laughter, as if the world
     of Cobb was finally too absurd. Cobb and a writer? In
     this weather? In any weather? And the man walks through
     the rain, laughing, heading on foot down off the mountain
     as Stump just stares.

     Stump turns and steps into the open doorway.

     barely lit. Taxidermied game hangs on the wall.
     Stump is terrified.
     A MAN is sitting in an overstuffed chair reading a news-
     paper. Dressed in a business suit and tie, he seems
     oblivious to the surrounding chaos. He also seems out of
     place.

                         C'mon Shep.  I've been eating borscht 
                         and drinking vodka for days.  Isn't

               The steward arrives with the Russian beer.  Marshall takes a 
               swig.  He swallows hard.  Piss-water.  Marshall crosses to 
               his sink and pours the beer out.  He hands the bottle to the 
               steward.

                         Fill this with Heineken.

               The steward nods...

                         Yes, Mr. President.

               AND SLINKS AWAY WITH THE BOTTLE. MARSHALL CATCHES HIMSELF --

          Jim seems stunned by the question. He hadn't thought about it
          in quite those words.

	          You are made for the light, Orson Now you must blow 
	          out your candles. But you must always remember, the 
	          cake itself is nothing. The flame, the lights, that 
	          is where your future lies. You must have a dream. A 
	          great dream worthy of you.
	
	The boy immediately spins to the cake and blows out the candles. A 
	moment of darkness. He turns back to the bed. The woman and the bed are 
	gone, faded into darkness.
	
	The solemn young lad stares and stares into the darkness
	
	And then, magically, the faint glimmer of twinkling stars fill his huge 
	dark eyes.
	
	NEWSREEL The flickering images of an old newsreel, circa 1940
	
	Under the MGM logo we see the title: BOY WONDER WOWS HOLLYWOOD!
	
	The first image after the title is the imposing figure of ORSON WELLES, 

	climbing down from an airplane and surveying the world at his feet.
	
	Welles is 24 years old and somewhat handsome. Welles seems rather 
	uncomfortable in his own body, as if it could not possibly contain his 
	vast passions and appetites.
	
	Orson Welles is man who tears his way through life with incendiary 
	energy. He is at once inspiring and ferocious; visionary and coldly 
	ambitious. He is part artist, part fraud and all showman.

	Louella is a much-feared gossip columnist. She is a gorgon in her 60's; 
	Margaret Dumont possessed by the devil and tanked up on gin. Her 
	capricious cruelty is only matched by her fervent loyalty to all things 
	Hearstian.
	
	Hedda is a gossip columnist in her 50's. She is given to elaborate hats 
	and villainous intrigue. Louella's younger, smarter rival, Hedda 
	probably spends her spare time eating children.

	          So today, almost a year after his arrival in 
	          Hollywood, we leave the Boy Wonder still hard at 
	          work developing his much-anticipated first feature, 
	          preparing to dazzle us all again. We're waiting, 
	          Orson!
	
	Welles after his RKO tour, smiling mischievously, stands before a 
	microphone:
	
	                         WELLES 
	          I'll tell you what, this is the best electric train 
	          set a boy ever had!
	
	"The End" and newsreel credits
	
	The newsreel sputters to a stop in a screening room. A shaft of light 
	shines on a large MGM logo on one wall. Another shaft of light 
	illuminates the sitting figure of LOUIS B. MAYER.
	
	Mayer is a short, crafty, bespectacled man in his 50's. His cloying, 
	avuncular exterior only fleetingly disguises the film titan's 
	outrageous barbarism.
	
	Another shadowy figure, a Mayer FLUNKIE, can be just glimpsed sitting 
	elsewhere in the screening room.
	
	Mayer glowers at the darkened screen for a moment.

	INT THE BROWN DERBY DAY\NIGHT
	
	The chic Brown Derby restaurant is the unquestioned palace of Hollywood 
	celebrities. The smug big-wigs and desperate hangers-on circulate and 
	score points in the Great Game of Movie Gossip.
	
	In one corner booth sits Hedda Hopper, phoning in the latest salacious 
	gossip to her newspaper. In the other corner booth Louella Parsons does 
	the same. They occasionally glance back and forth at each other like 
	ravenous hyenas eyeing the last bit of carrion.
	
	Welles circulates between them. In a scene reminiscent of the famous 
	CITIZEN KANE breakfast table scene with Kane and Emily, we shoot back 
	and forth as Welles applies his considerable charm to both women.
	
	Welles is dressed differently with each of them; breakfast with Hedda 
	and dinner with Louella.
	
	With Hedda, morning:

	In a scene eerily reminiscent of the Thatcher/Bernstein/Kane scene, 
	Marion sits in the extreme foreground, a man we do not know sits at 
	middle distance at a desk and Hearst stands far away.
	
	Hearst has his back to them and stares out a window.
	
	The new man is MR. LEWIS, a tight banker from New York, 50's.
	
	He looks over a thick legal document on the desk as he speaks:
	
	                         LEWIS You will retain some editorial control over the remaining 
	newspapers but the actual ownership will go to the Conservation 
	Committee and the banks. We will be immediately closing 12 of the 
	papers and the wire services. And we will be liquidating other assets 
	as soon as possible. Most of the land in Mexico as well as your 
	collection of art and antiquities--

	          We've been in touch with Gimbels in New York and 
	          they've agreed to hold a special sale. They're 
	          giving over an entire floor for the merchandise.

	          head I could give you a hundred others. I have been 
	          swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a 
	          belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, 
	          undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private 
	          lives should not be public property.
	
	                         WELLES 
	          Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name 
	          and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. 
	          In your papers you taught the world how to look 
	          under every rock. I learned at the knee of the 
	          master.
	
	                         HEARST 
	          So where does that leave us, Mr. Welles? What kind 
	          of sad future are we two making? A future where men 
	          will do anything to sell their newspapers and their 
	          movies? A future where no price is too high for fame 
	          and power? When we will all scratch each other to 
	          pieces just to be heard?
	
	Can you truly envision such ... horror.
	
	Hearst presses the stop button again and the elevator begins to move.
	
	The doors opens on Hearst's floor and he leaves the elevator.
	
	The doors are about to shut on Welles when he leans forward; and roars:

EXT. SQUARE - DAY (EARLY MORNING)
The line is long. At this moment, Joan is checking a
child's throat with a tongue-depressor. Aloka is walking
beside her with a fistful of depressors and a bag for
disposal. Hasari and Ram are getting ready to leave.
Anouar appears at Joan's waist.

         Good morning, Joan Di. Dr. Loeb
         said many of us could be helped;
         that all it would take is money
         for medication.
Anouar hands Joan some newspaper in which something is
wrapped. Joan opens the paper. Inside is a good deal of
money.
                       ANOUAR
         Please buy the medication for us.
         If we cannot come here to receive
         it, perhaps Dr. Loeb would come
         to us.
                       JOAN
         I'll be happy to buy the medication,
         but Dr. Loeb is not part of this

KILLICK exits the cabin with the tray of coffee cups. As he

A few of the old 'Surprises' have gathered for a smoke, all
of them men who've sailed with JACK before: Jittery alcoholic
Higgins, loyal Nehemiah Slade, sharp-faced tobacco-chewing
Faster Doudle, and the big Welshman Awkward Davies, still

his mate, BLACK BILL.

     down, snorts what is probably his fiftieth line of coke. He
     shakes it off, slams some Jack Daniels from the bottle as if
     it was Kool Aid. He's obliterated.

     As Ron stares off at something, T.J. waves at Crystal to join
     him and Kelly; as she does, we see what Ron is staring at -- a

                  This is Fluconazole. It helps them with
                  Thrush.

      Suddenly, the front door OPENS.   Police are in the room, guns
      drawn.

                            RICHARD BARKLEY
                  No one move. Put your hands in the air.

      The news camera keeps rolling.

                            TUCKER
                  Ronald Woodroof?

      Ron steps up through the crowd.

                  I have a warrant for your arrest, a

                  court order to cease and desist business
                  immediately.

      And with that, Ron allows Tucker to handcuff him. And as he
      does, the Customers "Boo" and "Hiss" loudly, all caught on by
      the News Crew.

                            RICHARD BARKLEY

          Danny's FATHER, 55, sits on a faded chair, an oxygen mask on
          a cart beside him. Danny's sister, LINDA, 30, is cutting his
          hair with a scissors. When Danny enters, they both look up
          at him in surprise, alarm, possibly even love. For a moment
          no one knows what to do.
          
          The father begins to wheeze, puts the mask over his face and
          breathes deeply. Linda tells him to lean back; resumes
          cutting. On the wall we see Danny's BAR MITZVAH PHOTO.
          
          Meanwhile, Danny has found a stack of mail, all addressed to
          him. His father and sister are visible behind him in a

               Galvin is at the bar, smiling to himself. His drink is being 
               refilled. To BARTENDER:

                                     GALVIN
                         I want to buy you a drink.

                         Thanks, Franky.

               Galvin looks around. A very attractive self-possessed YOUNG 
               WOMAN is sitting in the crook of the bar across from him; 
               she is intently perusing the newspaper and circling items 
               with a felt pen. Galvin speaks to her:

                                     GALVIN
                         Would you like a drink?

               She looks up. Smiles.

                         I'd like an apartment.

               She gestures at her own full glass in front of her.

                  the gas chamber and you haven't
                  even asked me what this is all
                  about.  You got a big guilty

                 Yeah, but you talked all the way from
                 GCI to the turnpike.  It sounds more
                 like a first date than a kidnapping.

                 What?

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL: WE'RE INSIDE A CAR

     Across the street from the KRONK RECREATION CENTER -- a red-
     brick building in a bleak, depressing neighbourhood.

                              BUDDY
                 You see this one...

     Buddy reads from a newspaper while Foley watches the gym.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 "Fight over tuna casserole may have
                 spurred slaying."  Seems this woman's
                 live-in boyfriend, seventy years old,
                 complained about her tuna noodle
                 casserole and she shot him in the face
                 with a twelve-gauge.  Police found
                 noodles in the woman's hair and think
                 the guy dumped the casserole dish on
                 her before she shot him.  They'd been
                 together ten years.

                              FOLEY
                 Love is funny.

     Buddy looks at him.  Notices something over Foley's shoulder.

                              BUDDY
                 Hey--

     And now Foley turns and looks over as the black Town Car
     pulls into the Kronk parking lot.

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 You call him that again I'll put your

                 He's a little crude, you understand.
                 No, I left that Snoopy shit behind me.

		Just as I thought. Even if you caught them in 
		the act, they'd deny it. They always deny 
		everything. And then, in this case, if they 
		were to admit having had the girl aboard, it 
		would mean they'd be admitting to the charge 
		of carrying contraband. Oh, it's easy to say:

Bidding goodbye to the Lieutenant, Anna's father leaves, without looking at 
Sandro. A moment later, Sandro folds the newspaper he was reading, tucks it 
under his arm, and starts heading towards the door.

A police siren is heard from afar, then before long it fills the air and 
dominates every other sound.  An Alfa Romeo pulls up, followed by a police 
wagon full of policemen. Both vehicles maneuver their way through the crowd 
like snakes through a jungle, and stop right in front of the shop. Sandro 
takes advantage of the opening created by the two cars and thus finds himself 
a few steps away from the door. Bending over in order to see through the 
small space left open by the half-drawn shutters, he notices several 
newspapermen and photographers.

Meanwhile, the policemen have come out of the wagon and arrive at the door of

shutter, and the crowd, which has backed away slightly at the insistence of 
the police, begins pressing forward threateningly. Soon pandemonium breaks 
loose. In the confusion, Sandro manages to get inside the store along with 
the policemen and two photographers. The shutter is again lowered, just a few 
inches behind him.

Standing in the middle of the shop is a most charming and provocative young 
brunette with tight-fitting pants and a blouse that is open almost from the 
neck to the waist. She is wearing nothing under her blouse, so that with 
every movement of her body, one cannot help catching a glimpse of her naked 
breasts. As the policemen come forward, she receives them with a smile. 
Sandro asks one of the journalists standing nearby if he can tell him which 
one of them is Zuria.  The journalist points to a man who is only a few steps 
away -- a man not very old but who has a ravaged face, and whose hair is 
almost completely white.

***
In the rear of a general store, on the outskirts of a small Sicilian town, a 
woman is seated at the window. She is very young, thin and irascible. Up 
front, her husband is speaking with Sandro, and as she listens attentively to 
what he is saying, a sarcastic smile spreads over her face.
 
				HUSBAND  
		Be patient, I can't remember everything. 

				SANDRO
			(indicating the newspaper article)
		But it even says what she bought: a bar of soap! 
		So there's no point in making believe you can't 
		remember.
 
After waiting a few seconds to give her husband a chance to explain himself, 
the wife jumps up from where she is sitting, comes over to Sandro and yanks 
the paper from his hands. Then she starts reading the article in a jerky 
manner typical of one who is not too literate.

		"A young female stranger, whose description

She suddenly stops reading and turns toward Sandro.

Claudia is immediately interested to hear this bit of news and is about to 
ask for additional information. But she is suddenly distracted by Sandro who 
enters the lobby at that very moment.

		I was just coming out to meet you. How come

Sandro doesn't answer but merely shrugs his shoulders. Then he takes Claudia 
by the arm and gently leads her towards the stairway. He has a worried 
expression on his face and remains absolutely silent as he starts climbing 
the stairs. As they walk through the corridor, Claudia looks at him 
anxiously, wondering what is wrong.

          Would you describe it as unruly?

                         OFFICER
          Compared to some I've seen, Roger,
          I'd have to say it was ruly.
          Definitely ruly.

          Don't worry -- they'll let us go
          pretty soon.
          The Hooker has been looking around with growing anxiety
          and now, she stands up.

                         HOOXER
          You dumb bastards -- can't anybody

          there's nobody driving the fucking

          There's a moment's silence as everyone digests this news.
          Then the Mother screams.

          111T. ASTOR PLACE PLATFORM
          as the lone car hurtles through the station.

          INT. TUNNEL - HIPPIE

          He raises himself on one elbow and shakes his head. He
          wipes some blood off his face and looks at his fingers.

          Then coming into FOCUS -- a group of men (the Mayor, the
          Commissioner, Warren LaSalle and a DOCTOR) are standing
          looking down at the Hippie (CAMERA) lying in bed.

                         DOCTOR
          I believe he's awake now --

                         HIPPIE
          Thank you, sir -- I only did what
          any other man on the force
          But they're already moving toward the door.

                         MAYOR
          He looks better than I do --
          probably feels better, too.
          The Hippie's eyes slowly close as he goes back to sleep.
          The time is SUPERIMPOSED:

          "9:03."

          EXT. TRANSIT AUTHORITY BLDG. - J AY ST. - NIGHT

          as Prescott comes down the front steps, alone, wearing a
          raincoat against the night's chill. He starts off down the
          street.

          EXT. FULTON ST. - NIGHT

          Most of the stores closed, their iron grills drawn, as Pres-
          cott walks along. He stops at a corner newsstand that's just
          being boarded up by an OLD WOMAN. He spots the Daily News
          headline -- "I.R.T. TRAIN HIJACKED!" -- and buys one.

                         OLD WOMAN
          Know what's gonna go next? The
          Empire State Building.

                         PRESCOTT

                         (SMILING)
          I wouldn't be surprised.
          He starts off down the street again, having folded back the
          front page and. now reading the third page. Suddenly he
          crumples the paper into a ,ball between his two hands, fakes
          dribbling it along the sidewalk, makes a good move, fakes
          one man, spins away from another and, hooking a high arching
          shot at a wire mesh trash basket, watches it hit the rim and
          bounce away, onto the pavement.
