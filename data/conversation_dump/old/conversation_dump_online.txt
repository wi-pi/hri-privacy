          All of these.Wow. I never knew that.

          MADELINE
          Wow. Yes, wow. Wow indeed.
          She hands Caden the very thick book. He flips through it,
          catching words and snippets here and there: Clairaudience
          ... vaginal juices... The echo began ... Plumbing ... Cats
          eat rats ... Me who am as a raw nerve ... Crease.

The same intense whispered exchange.  She glances into the

She turns the corner and again...NO ONE'S THERE.

INT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - DAY

She walks in and stands before:

The repaired photograph of herself and Norman...at the party
for the DUPONT CHAIR.

She takes it from the wall, stares at it for a moment, then
SMASHES IT ON THE EDGE OF THE DESK.  She extricates the
picture from the broken glass.  The caption reads:

"Dr. Norman Spencer being awarded the distinguished Dupont
Chair in Genetics by Dean of Sciences Torvald Ackerman."

She stares at the picture for a moment, then flips it over
and scans the stories on the back.  One tells of a hotly
contested city council race, another contains details of a
large alumni donation to the university.

She notices the bottom corner of another story she hadn't
noticed before.  It's only a small portion of one column, but
it seems to detail the search for A MISSING GIRL.

INT.  WORK ROOM - DAY

Claire, online, logs onto a missing persons website.  She
narrows her search to NEW ENGLAND.  A screen pops up with a

finds...FRANK, MADISON ELIZABETH.

IT'S THE GHOST.

          Samantha puts her hand onto the glass next to Hannah's and
          signs "s-t-o-r-m". Hannah turns to see her mother's face,
          and Samantha uses both hands to make the signed symbol.
          Fingers, spread and bent, moved downward.

           Storm.
          Hannah looks back out the window. They watch the storm
          together.

                         

          I/E. CURTIS' TRUCK/DEWART'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          The blue top of a small cooler is knocked to the floorboard
          as Dewart fishes the last Busch tallboy out of icy water. He
          cracks it open and takes an extended sip.
          Curtis, sitting behind the wheel of his truck, looks at his
          drunk friend.

                          CURTIS
           I gotta get home.

                          DEWART
           Nat and me been lookin' into a
           threesome. We've been chattin' with
           a girl online from Canton. Yeah.
           Big `ol girl.

                          CURTIS
           What's big?

                          DEWART
           She's about two fifty, two seventy
           five. She can't be no taller than
           5 foot.
          Dewart starts laughing, which makes Curtis laugh.

                          CURTIS
           Shit man.
          The laughing subsides.

                          CURTIS (CONT'D)
           I don't see me and Sam gettin' into
           somethin' like that.
