          Samantha lies under the covers looking at a real estate
          magazine. Curtis takes off his clothes by the dresser. He
          subtly removes a prescription bottle from his pants pocket
          and cups it in his palm.

                          SAMANTHA
           Oh, honey. Look at this one. It's
           a 2-1 and it sits directly on the
           beach. Wouldn't that be great? We
           wouldn't have to worry about Hannah
           crossing traffic.
          Curtis walks over and leans in to see the page. They are
          rental photos of beach condos.

                          CURTIS
           What's the rent?

           Eight ninety nine a week.

                          CURTIS
           That sounds real nice.
          Samantha keeps flipping through the magazine as Curtis heads
          to the bathroom.

     Donna and Peter Irving ..."

     Toward the end of the letter, there are two columns.  One is
     headed: "IN RANGE".  The other: "OUT OF RANGE".  Under that
     head appear the following: "lymphocytes, T-lymphocytes,

     The door opens and DR. JIM PAULSEN appears.  He's a classic

AN EMPTY APARTMENT - INTERIOR DAY

A large room in a typical old New-York apartment. Large windows
going almost to the ceiling. Through the windows we see roofs with
water tanks on them. The room is empty, save for a ladder and a
few tools.

The real estate agent is standing with some papers in his hand.
Sam and Allison are coming towards him from the other side of the
room.

        SAM
        But this is half the size for twice the price from your

          I'd seen her around, but never

          You know, I probably wouldn't even tell
          you this if I weren't a little tipsy,
          but... I am in complete awe of you. I

          Royce of local Real Estate firms, and
          your personal sales record is, is, is
          very intimidating. You know, I'd love to
          sit down with you and just pick your
          brain, if you'd ever be willing. I
          suppose, technically, I'm the

          don't flatter myself that I'm even in the

               Campbell, a lawyer, an insurance agent, a real estate

               are seated among the directors. The Chairman of the Board is 
               Dr. Campbell. They have folders and papers before them, on

                         Hi, everybody.

               Mr. Erganian and Jack get to their feet and shake hands with 
               Miles. Jack remains affable, but we can discern his genuine 
               irritation.

                                     JACK
                         About time you got here, bud. Mr. 
                         Prompt.

                                     MR. ERGANIAN
                         We were thinking maybe you took the 
                         wrong way and went to Tijuana and 
                         they didn't let you back in.

               The Erganians laugh. Miles works up a smile too.

                         ROSE
               You think that's all I can do?
               Clean other people's shit?

     Rose steps toward him and eyes Mac as he buttons her blouse.

                         MAC
               You know that's not what I think.

                         ROSE
               I am gonna be a real estate agent.

     Rose rubs the nicotine patch on her arm. Mac nods and smiles.

     Norah holds a lit joint out the window and watches a cheesy
     TV movie circa 1982. Big hair and leg warmers. Norah leans
     out the window and exhales, takes another toke.

     The sound of a key at the door prompts Norah to quickly stub
     out the joint and close the window. Rose opens the door.

                         NORAH
               It's about time. I thought your
               class got over at 9:30.

     Rose looks at Oscar sprawled out asleep on the couch.

                         ROSE
               Why isn't he in bed?

     Rose writes her number and address on the scrap of paper.

                            PAULA
                  So what are you doing now?

     Woops. Paula immediately regrets the question.

     Paula nods. Uncomfortable.

Mrs. Wolfe?

DOORMAN 
The real estate agent? You do have an appointment,
don't you?

Bateman steps out of the elevator and walks cautiously down
the hallway. Owen's door is open. The apartment is freshly 
painted and has been immaculately redecorated in English 
country-house style: overstuffed sofas, lots of chintz. There 
are flowers everywhere, and a YOUNG YUPPIE COUPLE stands 
admiring the place talkingto the realtor, MRS. WOLFE. Bateman 
wanders down the hallway, looking for familiar signs. He stops 
at the closet where we last saw two dead girls hanging. He 
opens the door and the light switches on, but it is empty. Mrs. 
Wolfe approaches, smiling.

MRS. WOLFE 
Are you my two o'clock?

BATEMAN 
No.

Mrs. Wolfe eyes him strangely, then looks down at the 
surgical mash clutched in his hand. Her expression changes.

MRS. WOLFE 
Can I help you?

I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.

She stares at him impassively.

               served on the California real estate
               board together. But Emmett was a bit of a
               crook. My husband got him kicked off the
               board for building dangerous buildings
               under phony corporations.

               Your husband sounds like a good man.

               He had his moments. Most of it was out of
               guilt. He owned slum blocks in San Pedro.
               When he learned he had cancer, he really
               started feeling guilty. He voted
               Democratic last year. Even went in and
               had meetings with the City Council. I'm
               sure he gave them dirt on Emmett.

                          BUCKY
               I read an article in the paper.
