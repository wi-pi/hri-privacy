We move over their shoulders to track closer to the black and
white TV screen.

                   TV PRESENTER
         You have been an opponent of those
         who want an easing in the ban on
         genetic research.

                     SILUS
         Yes.

                   TV PRESENTER
         They would say you're denying
         legitimate research into a science
         that would change the world.

                   SILUS
         The church does not deny the
         potential. Only the motivations of
         those who want to exploit it. And
         the fact that we understand so
         little of its power.

                   TV PRESENTER
         With the elimination of influenza,
         are we approaching a new era where
         disease might be a thing of the
         past?

As she is saying this we are now close on the TV's speaker.
We then begin tracking out. We reveal the speaker is not part
of the TV, but the speaker in Edgar's cell. Edgar, smiling
coldly as he listens. As he listens he is gently gliding his
finger nails against a sharp edge of the chair; sharpening
them.

                   SILUS
         Disease is part of nature, it will
         always be a part of our lives.

Close on Edgar.

                     EDGAR
         How true.

                         up, unhappily. It is far from a "merry" 
                         Christmas. It is a very lonely, conscience-stricken 
                         one.

Why not?

Because believing in everything at

He's young Santosh - he's still
finding his way.

And how can he find his way if he
does not choose a path?
    (To Pi:)
Listen: instead of leaping from one
religion to the next, why not start
with reason? In a few hundred
years, science has taken us farther
in understanding the universe than
religion has in ten thousand.

          MOTHER
That is true. Your father is right.
Science can teach us more about
what's out there -

- but not what is in here. Art,
music, literature - they all spring
from our faith.

                I do not expect us all to agree
                about everything. But I would much
                rather have you believe in
                something I don't agree with than
                to accept everything blindly. And
                that begins with thinking
                rationally. Do you understand?

     Pi nods.

          call it a social conscience. But

          realize that I did not know the
          blacks. Now I question my

          complacence as a white person.

                          HENRY
             One or two friends have refused to lend
             their support. Among them, Thomas More.
                    (a beat)
             And then there's the small matter of my
             conscience.

                          ANNE
             Why? You have justice on your side.

      HENRY stares, conflicted..

                          HENRY
             Do I?

      ANNE strokes his head. Pacifying him. But the look on her face
      tells us - this is getting harder and harder.

      HENRY sits at breakfast. Reading official correspondence. Legal
      documents. And private letters.

       e sorts through the various scrolls, matters of state, then
      finds one. A letter in a hand he does not recognise.

Darwin grunts noncommittally. The Crunch crunch of their
feet is punctuated by the regular stomp of his metal-shod
walking stick.

                    HUXLEY
          We intend to reclaim science as a
          profession - wrest it away from
          the country parsons and beetle-
          collectors. Your book will be our
          rallying point.

                    DARWIN.
          You know it is not yet any fit

                    HUXLEY
          I have read your detailed
          abstract. The argument is
          complete and utterly compelling.
          All that is lacking is the detail
          and we know you have that in
          abundance. Your barnacle work has
          established you as the pre-

     Looking back though the rear window Hooker sees Emma with
     the boys clustered around her skirts.

     In the darkened study, with his specimens and books all
     around him, Darwin kneels by the box.

     Steeling himself, he unlocks the padlock and opens the lid
     and takes out the papers and notebooks which are stored
     there.

     The bulk of it is a single manuscript, accumulated over
     many years, divided into 14 chapters with pages of notes
     interleaved.

     The Chapters are headed. Variation under domestication,
     variation under nature, Struggle for Existence, Natural
     Selection....

     always be in his imagination.

          Erlick and Spengler - at a dead end. Their trail leads them to a
          metal FENCE, the alley continuing beyond it. No time wasted
          they scale it.
          Perceval arrives - in time to see Erlick, landing on the other
          side. Spengler pulls himself over. Joins Erlick on the ground.

          PERCEVAL
          Shit, I'm not climbing this. Just combed
          my hair.
          Erlick and Spengler turn to him, through the metal bars. Their
          eyes are of disbelief.

MARY
I'd never seen it before.

JULIE
But you knew.

MARY nods in the affirmative. Tears form in JULIE'S eyes.

JULIE
What else is there, doctor? What else do 
you people know that the rest of us don't?

They stare at one another. Whatever bond once existed between them 
has been severed forever.

84	INT. A CONDITIONING ROOM IN THE CAVE - NIGHT

There are CARDIOGRAPHS, E.E.G. MONITORS, AND ALL SORT OF PHYSICAL 
CONDITIONING DEVICES. On TABLES lie SYMBOLOGY CARDS AND COLOURED 
BLOCKS for dexterity testing. There are LARGE CUT-OUT SHAPES on the 
walls, TRIANGLES, SQUARES and familiar ORANGE CIRCLES.

MARY storms into the room flinging the door shut behind her. RHODES 
catches it with his BLACK LEATHER GESTAPO BOOT.

RHODES
You can't run away from the planet, Miss 
Science. You can't even run away from the 
island, heh heh.

MARY
Leave me alone, you...COCKSUCKER!!!

RHODES laughs loudly. MARY faces him, hatred boiling away her 
vocabulary. She can't think of word that are adequate.

MARY
You're....you're disgusting! 
You're....FILTH!

RHODES
And you're the one who builds the bomb and 
they says, 'I hope it'll never actually be 
used'.

MARY is stopped...by her own guilt. She turns and busies herself 
gathering books and papers, then she CLICKS OFF A LIGHT and moves 
toward the doorway where RHODES stands.

MARY
(calmer, with method) Julie Grant is a 
behaviouralist. She's not medical. She 
hasn't been as...exposed to...to 
things...as some of the rest of us. She'll 
be alright. I'll talk to her. She'll be 
alright.

                         profoundly stupid happened last night.

                         It was Berlin.

               She's stunned, then genuinely angry.

                                     CONSTANCE
                         Oh, that's great, great. I can hear 
                         the grapevine now. They suspended 
                         her so Gale could dick her with a 
                         clear conscience.

               He looks at his coffee, which he hasn't touched.

                         A power differential equals coercion. 
                         Great. You are so weak.

               starts to collect the papers.

               Mark is caught off guard.

                         Sure, why not? I mean, every guy

INT. JOAN'S ROOM
Max's cigar. He sits slightly apart from Joan, Sunil,
Aloka, Ram, Hasari, Selima, Margareta, Surya, SALADDIN,
ASHISH and Shanta, Aristotle John, MEHBOUB, Anouar, and
Said.
Hasari is stretched out, Aloka rubbing his screaming
legs. Throughout the following, their eyes meet and
deflect...
                       SALADDIN
         The Godfather is at least
         civilized. The son is vicious.
         Remember the last elections -- the
         Molotov coctails, the blows with
         iron bars. They'll throw us out.
         We won't be able to find anyone
         else to rent to us. We'll just
         have to agree to pay what he
         wants.
                       MEHBOUB
         Saladdin's right. Neither nature
         nor the people with the power
         have any conscience. We have to
         pay.
A sigh escapes Surya.   He shakes his head.    Eyes
flick at him.
                       ASHISH
         What do you say, Doctor Big
         Brother?
                       SUNIL
         I think we must try to break the
         Godfather's hold on us.

This is startling and is met with a babble of cautious
agreement and dispute.
                       SUNIL
         Please, hear me out. But I think
         we have to be very cautious.
                       MAX
         How the hell do you proceed with
         caution against these people?
         You can't. You have to risk
         everything.

         We?   You have an airplane ticket.
Still, he's clearly piqued a lot of support.

                       SUNIL
         You know, Max, this is not
         American gangster television.
                       SALADDIN
         Yes, if you're wrong, you don't
         have to be here.
                       MAX
         I'm not wrong. You bow your heads,
         you plead with your Gods to do
         what you won't do yourselves.
         You put up with this nightmare
         as if there were no choice. I'm
         telling you, if you don't stand
         up to that little pimple face
         now, he'll own you for the rest
         of your lives.
Everyone stares at him. Many of them want to buy his
commitment. There's another large sigh from Surya.
Aloka and Hasari's eyes bang off of each other, she
silently urging him to speak. He's deeply conflicted
and deeply frightened.
                       ANOUAR
         Even though I am invisible to some
         of you and I don't have a complete
         set of legs to stand on, I stand
         with the Doctor Big Brother. Maybe
         nature doesn't have a conscience
         or those with the power, but don't
         we?
Said, the giant mute, mades an unintelligible sound in
his throat, but clearly he's agreeing with Anouar.

           When I told you I could make your

           Science is just a name for the art

           has no boundaries- its very purpose
           is to destroy boundaries.

Boss Tweed reigns in the banquet room of a vast, gaslit restaurant, at a
long table overburdened with food. Seated along both sides of the table is
an array of the city's POWER BROKERS, with whom Tweed and his Tammany
MINIONS mix easily. Their attitude toward the Power Brokers is a mixture
of ribald fawning and fine condescension; the Power Brokers, in turn,
enjoy the food, and the MUSIC from a small BAND, and the DANCING GIRLS who
flirt and entertain them, while exuding the unmistakable impression of
amateur anthropologists exploring a decaying civilization.

Tweed is courting and joking with a bewhiskered HORACE GREELEY, editor of
the influential Tribune.

GREELEY
I may enjoy the bounty of your table and the pleasures of your company,
Mr. Tweed ...

BOSS TWEED

I suppose you can at that. Take with one hand, flay with the other.
Virtuels on your conscience, Horace, but Tammany's in your heart.

Killoran materializes at Tweed's side and whispers something quickly,
discreetly in his ear. Tweed EXCUSES himself, rises quickly and WALKS
across the restaurant floor...

          We're not sure exactly how old he
          is due to lack of records. He has
          a measured IQ of 80. That's 6th
          percentile. He's been enrolled in
          seven different institutions,
          including a gap of eighteen months
          around the age of ten when he
          apparently didn't attend school at
          all. He repeated first grade as

          Jacob sits beside a beautiful Blonde who distracts him with
          her legs. She notices him staring, crosses her legs and
          smooths her skirt.
          VETERINARY SCIENCES FINAL EXAMS is written on the board of a
          Lecture Hall. The Proctor announces from his desk.

                         THE PROCTOR
          You may begin.
          Jacob, the Blonde and fifty other students open their exam
          booklets and begin under The PROCTOR's supervision.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          I had my whole life planned. I knew
          exactly where it was taking me...
          And then, with the opening of a
          door, it all vanished.
          The Lecture Hall door opens and DEAN WILKINS enters. The Dean
          walks to the Proctor and they confer privately. Then:

                         THE PROCTOR
          Mr. Jankowski? May we have a word?
          Fifty pairs of eyes turn to look at Jacob, who looks up.

          EXT. LECTURE HALL - CONTINUOUS - DAY

          Jacob steps outside with Dean Wilkins.

            I have a murder on my conscience,

            it's yours. And as you're the one
            to profit, I think you should be the
            one to pay for it.

For an instant his nervous hands seem to be struggling with
the urge to kill Guy.

Bruno goes to the door in silent acquiescence and opens it
for Guy to pass through.


INT. HALLWAY MED. SHOT

Guy walks toward the stairs, tense and apprehensive. Bruno
is following him, still holding the gun. When the Great
Dane sees Bruno it gets to its feet, as if waiting for a
command.

Guy starts down the stairs but Bruno stays where he is, the
dog beside him. Gay turns and looks back it this tableaux
of menace.

                        BRUNO
            Don't worry. I'm not going to shoot
            you, Mr. Haines. It might disturb
            mother.

            I'm a very clever follow. I'll think
            of something better than that. Much
            better.

Bruno remains in the foreground of the scene as Guy proceeds
on down the stairs. We see him open the front door and pass
through.

          What, sir?

                    STEPHEN
          Those birds!

He's looking at a group of unremarkable black seabirds
waddling about on a rock, flapping short, stumpy wings.

                    STEPHEN (CONT'D)
          A species of cormorant. But apparently
          flightless, by all that's Holy. I believe
          that is unknown to science.

BLAKENEY dwells briefly on the strange rock-climbing birds
then drifts back to the iguanas.

                    BLAKENEY
          The dragons don't seem to bother 'em.

                    STEPHEN
          They are a type of iguana I should think,
          and therefore vegetarian.
His telescope remains focussed on the cormorants. BLAKENEY is
wholly absorbed in the iguanas.

                    BLAKENEY
          Will you catch one?

                    STEPHEN
          Yes. Most certainly. And if we can, some
          eggs.

          No Jack, You have forgotten your self.
          You once believed in the rights of each
          individual man no matter how useless or
          lowly. But it seems to me now that the
          long exercise of power has brought you to
          the point where even a solemn promise...

                    JACK
          The promise was conditional.

                    STEPHEN
          ...a promise to a friend of ten years
          standing who has stood by you and

lifetime of work in science. He bows slightly, then leaves.

215         QUARTERDECK - DUSK

STEPHEN stands alone at the taffrail watching as the islands
recede in the distance.

News of the violent argument has spread and there is many a
sympathetic glance, which further humiliates STEPHEN.

BLAKENEY approaches him carrying something carefully in the
palm of his hand.

          Sir, I found a curious beetle walking on

He opens his hand - close, on a very plain little brown
beetle.

                      BLAKENEY (CONT'D)
            I think it's a Galapagos Beetle, sir.

		"Understanding Poetry"?

				NEIL
		Understanding Poetry, by Dr. J. Evans
		Pritchard, Ph.D. To fully understand
		poetry, we must first be fluent with
		its meter, rhyme, and figures of speech.
		Then ask two questions: One, how artfully
		has the objective of the poem been
		rendered, and two, how important is that
		objective. Question one rates the poem's
		perfection, question two rates its
		importance. And once these questions have
		been answered, determining a poem's
		greatest becomes a relatively simple
		matter.

Keating gets up from his desk and prepares to draw on the chalk board.

				NEIL
		If the poem's score for perfection is
		plotted along the horizontal of a graph,
		and its importance is plotted on the
		vertical, then calculating the total
		area of the poem yields the measure of
		its greatness.

Keating draws a corresponding graph on the board and the students
dutifully copy it down.

     Fellow drunks welcome their comrade from plastic chairs.

               I would have to register you to give 
               you something to eat and my conscience

               He looks pale. You're not eating

               He just needs a bath and some food.

            brewing and I don't want to know...
            But when the music stops, I'd be
            much obliged if Keitel should find
            himself without a chair.

                                                      47.



     Is Fromm saying he's in? Is Keitel's death a
     condition? Hard to say and meant to be. Before
     Stauffenberg can inquire, Fromm slams the door shut
     and returns to the madness inside the Berghof.

                        STAUFFENBERG
            They're all insane. Every one of
            them except for Speer, and he's
            nothing but an architect.

     Stauffenberg puts on his eyepatch before removing his
     glass eye. He polishes it with a cloth and now it
     stares at him from his gloved hand. A conscience.

                    STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D)
            Tell Beck we've found our
            assassin...

48   INT. CHURCH - NIGHT                                     48

     We find ourselves in an empty church. Beck is seated
     in a pew staring straight ahead. Stauffenberg sits
     directly behind him. They can't risk being seen
     together. They speak in hushed tones.

     The first thing we notice is how weak and ill Beck
     looks. He struggles to hide a persistent cough.

                            BECK
            Out of the question. It won't work.
            We need you here in Berlin.

                       STAUFFENBERG
            Who else, then? Who can even get as
            close?

     Beck knows there is no other choice.

           happened, but it's not your fault. Mark
           stresses that every time it comes up.
           Take some time to absorb this. Your
           science schedules are cleared for
           tomorrow. Send all the questions you
           want and we'll answer them. Henderson

           Not three in three thousand
           schoolgirl governesses would have
           answered me as you've just done.
                         
                          JANE
           You've clearly not spent much
           time in the company of schoolgirl
           governesses. I'm the same plain
           kind of bird as all the rest,
           with my couple of accomplishments
           and my common tale of woe.

           I envy you.

                          ROCHESTER
           Your openness, your clear
           conscience, your unpolluted mind.
           If I were eighteen I think we truly
           would be equals. Nature meant me to
           be a good man, one of the better
           kind and as you see, I am not so.
                         
                          JANE
           Are you a villain then, sir?
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           I'm a trite commonplace sinner,
           hackneyed in all the dissipations
           that the rich and worthless try
           to put on life.
                          (HE SIGHS)
           When I was your age, fate dealt me
           a blow. I was - cursed with a
           burden to carry through life. I
           lacked the wisdom to remain cool
           and I turned desperate. Dread
           remorse, Miss Eyre. It is the
           poison of life.
                         
          Rochester takes in her open, compassionate face.

           And since happiness is denied me,
           I've a right to get pleasure in
           its stead. And I will get it,
           cost what it may.

           You'd kill me without drawing any

                          JANE
           Because I would inevitably come to
           conceive love for you, because you
           are so talented and good, because
           there is such grandeur in your
           look. You wouldn't want this
           strange and torturing love; if I
           showed it you would find it
           unbecoming. And my lot would be
           wretched.

We did a lot of work. I guess I was wrong.

WILL

People have been wrong about a lot of things.

THE GREAT VALLEY

stretches out below - primordial forests and cascading streams. Will and
Diamond stand on a rock ledge outside the cave.

WILL (CONT'D)

This is the rift valley in Kenya -

He points at the towering, snow-capped peak.

WILL (CONT'D)

That's Kilamanjaro - ten thousand feet higher but a hundred thousand years
of wind and rain will turn it into the mountain we know. Think of it -
we've come back a hundred thousand years! Everyone told me it couldn't be
done, but we've crossed the frontier now - Man has traveled through space
and time. How long has science dreamed of that?

DIAMOND

How long have you?

WILL

All my life.

DIAMOND

Dream no more. You've done it. Like you said in your note - it was Doctor
Robert Plant of UC Berkeley.

WILL turns and looks out at the valley -

WILL

(softly)

Yeah - I really have, haven't I?

Diamond watches him. There's a shout from inside the cave -

Sure. Of course it's about that too.

DIAMOND

But then, you don't care muchabout people do you?

THEY LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER. A BEAT. WILL'S VOICE IS HARD -

WILL

No - I guess I don't. Not for a long time. Ideas and knowledge are what
matter. They're the shining ideals. That's the only way we progress.

DIAMOND

Progress to what? We're both children of our age, aren't we? We've grown up
to believe the more we know, the more advanced we are. But what does that
mean if we've forgotten the things of real value. You know the reason I
came? It's got nothing to do with science or knowledge. I'm going to have a
child -that's why I'm here.

They look at one another.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

Uke you said, the women's out there somewhere. Why ere we traveling with
them?

(indicates Aragore and Strider)

We should cut ourselves loose.

WILL

We wouldn't last a day. We've got to keep moving, Billie. The apes are like
storm-troopers.

DIAMOND

Where are they now?

WILL

Right behind. I think Strider has some sort of tribal intuition. He says he
can hear their hoof beats in his head.

The first rays of dawn pierce the mist from the waterfall. Will and Diamond
turn at a sound behind them - Aragorn is getting up.

Listen to me -

DIAMOND

We've got four weeks, Willl Four weeks to find her. She's not here, so whet
are we waiting for? Let's go!

The tribes-people turn at the raised voices. Will takes Diamond's arm and
guides her to a private corner -

WILL

Listen, Billie! We know the future - but if we beat the apes, they can't
harm the woman.

DIAMOND

Beat the apes?! And say we don't - or say one of us gets captured. What
then? Don't you understand? Four weeksi

WILL

Yeah, I understand - but those things aren't going to happen. We know
things the apes can't even dream of. This is our world, Billie - men won it
with their minds. All we need is knowledge and science. We've got them
both. We can win!

DIAMOND

What are we going to do - dazzle them with calculus? This is an army, Will
- you said it yourself. Storm-trooperst

WILL

Look -

He bends and picks up s rock from the ground. He hands it to Diamond -

WILL (CONT'D)

Taste it. That's saltpeter - the natural form of potassium nitrate. The
caves are littered with the stuff. You've smelt the air - there's sulfur
all around. If we burn timber, that'Il give us charcoal. You're s scientist
- you know what it means.

Sure - she knows what it means. She stares at him.

DIAMOND

It's strange, isn't it? Give s man s problem and the first thing he thinks
about is weapons.

No.

DIAMOND So what of my child?

We have to face it - you're going to lose it.

She turns away, trying to keep her emotions in check. Will comes to her
side -

WILL (CONT'D)

We can't take our eye off the goal. If we solve this, you can have other
children. Not if wa throw our lives away, though.

DIAMOND

Whose, Will - whose children?

She looks at him. He meets her gaze. A beat.

WILL

guess that's your call.

DIAMOND

What sort of father would you make? You told me once the only thing that
matters is knowledge. That's wrong. Science and technology can only take
you so far - in the end it's our humanity that maners. That's what makes us
great. You're a wonderful scientist, Will -but what sort of person are you?
What would you do if it was your child?

She looks straight into his eyes. Finally he answers. Softly -

WILL

I don't know how to do it - not the humanity part, that's easy compared to
getting into the city. I just don't know...

He picks up a stick and starts to scratch out a rough map on the ground.

WILL (CONT'D)

It sits on a river. There's only one bridge -heavily guarded. Even if we
could cross it, all the ridges and roads are patrolled -

STRIDER

There's one place that's not.

Both Diamond and Will turn to him. He takes the stick -

STRIDER (CONT'D)

Down here - it's called Funeral Rock. It sits at the bottom of the temple.
From there you can make your way into the city. Even so, you still have to
cross the river.

He draws an arrow across the water, illustrating the problem. Diamond is
about to speak but she looks at Will - he's staring at the arrow, an idea,
half formed, is starting to form.

How?

Will turns to her -

WILL

You'll love it - there's barely any science to it at all.

DIAMOND

We're going? Is that right - we're going!?

Their eyes meet and hold. He smiles at her.

THREE SILHOUETTES

travel fast along a high ridge. The sun - a fiery disc - rises right behind
them. We recognize their physiques - Will in the lead, then Diamond and
Strider. As they cross the face of the sun, we dissolve to -

LIGHTS TWINKLE

on the buildings and terraces of the apes' city. Will and his two comrades
are on a bluff, looking down. The sound of music and laughter drifts
towards them on the night air. Suddenly a huge tongue of flame shoots out
of a stone chimney.

STRIDER

They've started up the furnace.

Juliet squeezes Pauline's hand.

JULIET
. . . in pursuit of happiness.

WIDE SHOT of the fire.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) We both spent last night having a simply wonderful time in every possible way.

FADE TO BLACK

INT. RIEPERS' CAR/EXT. STREETS - DAYFADE IN . . . CLOSE-UP of Pauline's face. SLOWLY PULL OUT . . . to reveal HONORA 
and HERBERT 
sitting in the front of the car. They are driving home.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) I was picked up at 2:00 P.M. I have been very sweet and good. I have worked out a little more of our plan. Peculiarly enough I have no qualms of conscience.

INT. RIEPERS' HOUSE - DAYHONORA 
is bustling about the house, working. Every time she bends down, or leans over, Pauline is revealed behind her. She is helping, but the mood is one of a hunter closing in on its prey.

PAULINE
(Diary V.O.) I rose late and helped Mother vigorously this morning. Deborah rang and we decided to use a rock in a stocking rather than a sandbag. We discussed the moider fully. I feel very keyed up as though I were planning a surprise party. Mother has fallen in with everything beautifully and the happy event is to take place tomorrow afternoon. So next time I write in this diary Mother will be dead. How odd-yet how pleasing.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ILAM/JULIET'S BALCONY - DAYJuliet is singing a haunting aria. Tears are welling in her eyes. The aria continues over . . .

EXT. OCEANLINER'S DECK - DAY BLACK &amp; WHITE . . .Pauline and Juliet are happily bounding along the decks, pushing past OTHER PASSENGERS. They are wearing holiday clothes.

		Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think.
		Is Mac okay?

			CAL
		I don't know what's going on.  I don't
		care to guess.  Mac's really unhappy.
		She isn't there, that's all.  She's no
		idea what she's playing, not a clue.

			JOE
		Who, Sally?

			CAL
		And, you know it isn't rocket science,
		this script.  She can barely get the
		lines out.  There was a scene last week -
		she sobbed, through every take.  I know
		crying's easy for her but it's a fucking
		comedy, Joe.  Something's gone.  You
		know, that thing that was Sally - that
		always surprised you.  It's gone.  I
		think she's scared.  And that's death.

			JOE
		I still think she sails above the rest.
		I mean not like her early films.  But
		those were all such great directors.

			CAL
		Mac's a pretty great director, Joe.  He's
		a woman's director.  And nothing's
		happening.  Course he won't fire her,
		because of the friendship... But it was
		discussed.  He had to battle his studio
		to get her in the first place.

			JOE
		What?

			CAL
		Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's
		best friend.
			(to Joe's stare)
		I never said any of this, alright.  I'll
		deny it on the stand...
			(into the silence)
		You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so
		great.  Maybe that's what this is all
		about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this
		anymore.  You know adults don't do this
		for a living.  You guys are gonna have
		your kids, you'll be directing -- one
		asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia
		knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair.
		Clair's a mess.
			(throws an arm around him)
		Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget
		that natural childbirth shit.
		Everything's going to be what it's
		supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking
		shadow.  A poor player who struts and
		frets his hour upon the stage and then is
		heard no more..." And speaking of me, the
		role of Leo in your film?

Winter digs under a supply table for a new bowl. Rising, he
catches his reflection in a grimy mirror over a wash basin.
He hesitates, maybe suffering a crisis of conscience -- when
he sees A REFLECTED FACE lurking in the shadows behind him!

He spins to see CAESAR standing there, motionless, staring...

Panicked, Winter turns for the exit -- but LUCA is there,
blocking escape. Turns the other way -- and there's ROCKET.
Winter's eyes widen as Caesar takes a slow step toward him...

                       CAESAR
             Where is the Colonel?

Winter swallows, trembling as he lifts his hands to sign:

                       WINTER
             [He's gone.]

                       CAESAR
                 (dubious, stalking closer)
             ...Gone?

Winter looks at the other apes, sees them closing in too...
Turns back to Caesar, nervously explaining:

                        WINTER
             [This morning. He took many soldiers
             with him.]

          We have grown wiser with age.  Now
          we know that some problems cannot be
          settled with a sword.

                     ATHOS
          And some problems cannot be settled
          without one.

                     ARAMIS
          Well here is the problem at hand:
          the King has ordered me to discover
          the identity of the Governor General
          of Jesuits, and kill him.  As our
          English rivals have left the
          Catholic Church, Louis has struck on
          a plan to dominate the whole of
          Europe by uniting Church and State
          and making himself head of both.  He
          has already picked the Pope.  Only
          the Jesuits, who put God above
          throne or papacy, stand in his way.

                     PORTHOS
          But -- doesn't God ordain both Pope
          and King?

                     ARAMIS
          So they tell us.  But what are we to
          believe when the king is a tyrant,
          and the Church, meant to stand for
          all those oppressed, has become the
          tool of oppression?  When no
          conscience is tolerated?  No
          dissent, no objection?

                     PORTHOS
          It is a weighty problem, Aramis --
          but perhaps you should leave it to
          this secret General of the Jesuits,
          whoever he might be.

                     ARAMIS
          Easy to say, but hard to do.  For
          what I am trying to tell you is that
          I am the Governor General of Jesuits
          in France.

A stunned silence.

                     ATHOS
          What do you propose to do?

          Replace the king.

		Stop, that's enough. No more.

	He pulls her loose and she growls and stares at him
	with big clear astonished eyes.

      . . . the face of Bogart -- unshaven, paranoid.
      a badly damaged 16 mm print of The Treasure of the Sierra -
      Madre.     It's near the end of the film and he's alone, talking
      to himself just before the bandits get him....

      The rag-tag audience is noisily yammering back at the screen,
      the camera moving past Manny Ray, chewing gum, hair slicked,
      eyes in cat-like repose...to Tony, enrapt, eyes like an
      eleven year old, mouth hanging open.

Graham doesn't take his eyes off the screen.

                    GRAHAM
              (preoccupied)
          Find another tape.

Graham and Merrill sit down at the same time on the sofa. 
They both have the same dazed, slow movements.

Morgan rummages through the pile of videos frantically.  He
finds one and reaches for the VCR.

                    MORGAN
          Uncle Merrill, I'm using your tape.

Morgan slams the tape marked "Bay Watch" into the VCR and
presses record.  He's breathing heavy now.  Wheezing
actually.

Morgan moves to the sofa and takes a seat in between his
father and his uncle.  Bo walks over and squeezes in also. 
The four of them stare at the television.

                    TV ANCHOR

          books is about to change.

Beat.

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MIDNIGHT

The family room lights are off now.  The TV is still on.  The
SOUND IS MUTED.  There are a couple glasses of Bo's water on
the television now.

The fourteen lights are still hovering on the screen.  Morgan
is asleep on Graham's lap.  Bo is asleep on Merrill's
shoulder.

                    MERRILL
              (whispers)
          Some people are probably thinking
          this is the end of the world.

Graham turns his sleepy eyes away from the screen to Merrill.
