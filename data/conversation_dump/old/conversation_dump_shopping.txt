INT. PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Paulie unlocks the apartment door and enters... Rocky
stiffly follows.  Paulie's sister steps out of the kitchen.
A large serving spoon is in her hand... The TV is on.

She stops short and eyes Rocky... She is visibly unsettled
by Rocky's unexpected presence.

				ADRIAN

		Paulie, you're late.

She looks at Rocky again.

				PAULIE
		Did you call the hospital?

		If I'm ten minutes late, she
		calls the hospital.

Adrian enters the bedroom and slams the door... Paulie
follows.  An argument ensues and Rocky overhears.

OVER the argument is HEARD a SPORTS BROADCAST rising from
the TELEVISION.

				COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
		... Unfortunate luck for
		fifth-ranked heavyweight, Mac
		Lee Green.  The slugging

		Fight to be held in Philly
		next month... By the way,

The crowd disperses, leaving Dipper a pathetic and broken

INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

They enter the dismal apartment... On the floor are at least
ten telegrams.  Rocky scoops them up and tosses them aside.
Next to the door is a pile of over a hundred telegrams.
				ADRIAN
		Don't you open them anymore?

				ROCKY
		They either say, 'Kill the

Adrian steps to the window.  She pulls a pair of short but
lovely curtains from a shopping bag... The colorful curtains
glare in the dark room.

				ADRIAN
		Like?

				ROCKY
		Sharp -- Real nice.

				ADRIAN
		Really -- You don't think

				ROCKY
		No... Sharp -- You look great.

Adrian smiles and pulls out a small Christmas wreath...
Rocky smiles.  His eyes show what he feels for this woman.

          In the burnt, barren landscape, through swirls of soft ash
          and smoggy air the MAN appears dressed in a filthy old PARKA
          with the hood up, a knapsack on his back, pushing a rusted
          shopping CART with a bicycle mirror clamped to the handle and
          the BLUE tarp now covering it's load. The little BOY,
          similarly dressed with a KNAPSACK on his back, shuffles
          through the ash at his side - like Depression-era Dust Bowl
          homeless.

          drunks now. They hear a hideous SHRIEK in the distance,
          coming from the house. They stop, hearing another SHRIEK and
          a MAN'S SCREAMING. The MAN holds the BOY close and tries to

          They are back in the city, trudging through the parking lot
          of a huge shopping mall, just outside what used to be SEARS
          department store. A dull moon hidden in the ashen sky
          illuminates the ruined store front as the MAN looks up at the
          mall, thinking. The BOY is just staring into space, still in
          shock.

          The MAN and the BOY have set up camp in the mall, outside the
          SEARS entrance. The MAN is building a big fire. The BOY
          stares through the glass at the deserted department store.
          Nearby, strewn across the doorway are bunches and bundles of
          cash in notes and coins... the BOY looks closer and finds
          expensive items of jewelry still in their boxes, LOOTED from
          the store and discarded.

                          
          The BOY sits, he looks like he's given up, and then: 

          BOY. 
          Papa? Papa, we wouldn't ever eat
          anybody would we?

          filthy rags. Skin plagued by an unpleasant rash.
          
          The SHOPPING CART she was pushing has overturned into a
          roadside ditch, spilling its contents. Blankets, tins of
          food, old clothes. She's on her knees trying to gather it up.

                            PINTA
               My last bodyguard. He drove me to school
               in the morning and picked me up in the
               afternoon.

Finally Creasy turns, looks at her hard.

                            CREASY
               I'm here for you?

Pinta smiles huge, nods.

                            PINTA
               In between you can take Mom shopping and
               to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr.
               Creasy?

                             CREASY
               Creasy.   Just call me Creasy.

                            PINTA
                      (big grin)
               Creasy...

Frank's tail wags imperceptibly.

                            PINTA
               Looks like he approves of you.

And then, walking on air, she's out the door.

Creasy sets up his room with meticulous precision that
comes from years in the military. Front and center he
arranges his shrine: an almost empty bottle of scotch and
a glass (engraved from an earlier encounter) next to a
pack of Marlboros and his weathered Zippo. Then, his
beaten up gun and holster. A well-travelled New
Testament is placed in the drawer.

          Borden walks along a disused strecth of industrial canal
          that snakes through the poorer neighborhoods of the city.
          Borden wanders into a tunel. Another man is waiting for

          Fallon hands Borden a folded piece of paper. He studies it.

           knows things aren't right.

               out on the bed surrounded by piles of clothing, scissors and

                         It's kind of like it's saying "Hi, 
                         Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"

                         I came over as soon as I got that 
                         cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. 
                         My stepmom verbally abused the

                         For, you know, the baby. Babies need 
                         a lot of things. I want everything 
                         to be just right.

                         I thought people got all that stuff 
                         at baby showers. When my stepmom had 
                         my sister I remember she got about a 
                         million presents. They were all lame 
                         though, so I wasn't jealous.

	In the distance, we see the pick-up truck parked out in the

	around Grace, asking questions, interested in everything... 
	Grace is loving being with her two favorite men...

INT. CATCH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

He walks into a bare living room -- no chairs, tables,
lamps, nothing on the walls. He walks into a spotless,
never-used kitchen and flips on the light, opens a
drawer.

In the drawer is a collection of kids' toys, some found,
some purchased, mostly plastic figures. The action of
opening the door has started some battery-operated
animals moving around in there. Now from his pocket he
takes the plastic superhero he just found and drops it in
and closes the drawer.

He walks back into the living room. He sits on the
floor, leans back against the wall, his clothes still
soaked from the rain. He stares at his thoughts, looking
a bit numb -- and lost.

Sharon, a real talker.

She is pulling a new blue dress out of a shopping bag.

                        MRS. VANDER
          It's for the church and the party.

He smiles at her, a bit less subdued than before as he
gets his things into the hall -- and he manages a special
look for Tommy, a wink. He frees the elevator; they step
inside. As the door starts to close, Catch's face

We hear Tommy laugh as the door closes. Catch carries

A well-kept older home, well-planted, pretty. A woman of

approaching the gate in the wooden fence. She looks up.
Sharon is at the gate, in uniform, on her dinner break.
The older woman is her MOTHER, Elaine Pogue. There is an
old strain between them, a sadness -- and a nervousness
in Elaine. She's a quiet woman. She smiles at her
daughter as Sharon comes through the gate. They hug
tentatively, a lot of baggage here. Sharon turns to the
garden.

        A week has passed and the outside of the house is completely
        clear of press/onlookers. Nancy's car pulls up. She get's
        out, let's Jack out of the back seat and the two of them
        carry shopping bags to the front door. A NEIGHBOR waves.

          Hitch watches Gein as he threads a needle, stitching
          something expertly together. He notices there's no hint of a

                And take care, Mikhail.

     Yuri tenderly takes his overcoat from Nikolai's shoulders
     and goes back through the fire-escape door. Nikolai is
     left cold and exposed in his thin gown.

86   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. WARD. NIKOLAI'S ROOM - DAY             86

     Nikolai is playing chess against himself, sitting on the
     bed, trying hard to concentrate. There is a knock and
     Anna enters, carrying an old shopping bag. She takes out
     a worn pair of jeans and a T-shirt, a denim jacket and a
     battered pair of shoes. Nikolai smiles...

                            NIKOLAI
                How is Uncle Stepan?

     Instead of answering, Anna lays the clothes on the bed.

                            ANNA
                    (deadpan)
                They're from the morgue. They
                belonged to someone who died
                yesterday.

     Nikolai picks up the jeans and examines them.     They're way
     too big.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                I can't believe I'm doing a favor
                for someone just because he had
                the decency not to murder a member
                of my family.

     Nikolai smiles but Anna turns to leave...

                            NIKOLAI
                Hey... wait a minute...

     Nikolai steps behind the bed screen to pull on the jeans.
     He speaks from behind the screen.

Andy's crappy apartment, which looks like a dorm room: Cheap
furniture, stained carpet, and a framed photo of the

THOUSANDS OF LETTERS.  He happily chats on the phone.

	Really! ...I got your fan letter...
	So you like the show?  Your letter

	glad.

Andy holds a letter which has a GIRL'S SNAPSHOT stapled to
it.  He is very nervous.

A disinterested beat.

          Through the curtain, HELLBILLY CANNIBAL emerges. A huge,
          overalls-clad, mangy, wild-eyed masochist. Crumbs cling to
          his scraggly beard. He's dragging a heavy CANVAS SACK.
          
          A TEENAGER in the crowd holds up a sign reading HELLBILLY
          CANNIBAL SUCKS A FAT DICK.
          
          Hellbilly Cannibal climbs into the ring with his sack and a
          folding chair. He heads to the center of the ring, where
          Randy awaits.
          
          They sit down on chairs facing each other. Under Hellbilly
          Cannibal's chair is his canvas sack. Under Randy's is his
          Dollar Tree plastic shopping bag.
          
          Hellbilly Cannibal punches Randy. Randy punches Hellbilly
          Cannibal. They take turns punching each other, each shot a
          little harder than the last. It's like a violent game of
          "slaps".
          
          After a stretch of this, Hellbilly Cannibal reaches into his
          sack and pulls out a can of BUG SPRAY. He SPRAYS it in
          Randy's face. Randy falls off his chair. He staggers around
          the ring clutching his face, howling in agony.
          
          Hellbilly Cannibal smashes the blinded Randy over the head
          with his chair. Randy falls to his knees. Hellbilly Cannibal
          reaches into his sack and pulls out a FLUORESCENT LIGHT TUBE.
          Wielding it like a bat, he SMACKS RANDY in the face. The tube
          explodes with a pop.
          
          Grabbing a folding chair, Hellbilly Cannibal charges toward
          Randy. He takes a flying leap, riding the chair like a boogie
          board. Just as he's about to crash down on Randy, Randy ROLLS
          OUT OF THE WAY. Hellbilly Cannibal's spine gets a violent
          jolt as the chair hits the mat.

          I just don't like to be both privately
          and publicly insulted.

                      BEN
          Can you blame him? Turning down an
          old married couple for a date with a
          girl like that?

                       JO
          We're not an old married couple! All
          right -- He's a heel. I don't
          understand him -- and I'm beginning
          not to like what he's doing to our
          whole night.

Drayton, quietly amused, is listening to Ben and Jo.
But Mrs. Drayton is embarrassed. She makes conversation
at random.

          I must do some shopping in the market
          tomorrow. I do hope it'll be fine.
          Fine, but not too fine. Of course, I
          how our English weather is awful, but
          I sometimes think we don't know when
          we're lucky. All this sunshine, day
          after day. It seems unnatural, somehow.

Ben makes as if to rise, but Jo holds him down.

          I want to get up.

          up, you'll start a fight. Now please,
          sit down and forget him.

              (To the McKennas)
          By the way, it'd be pleasant if you'd
          let us show you round the market place,

a case of BEER in his shopping cart. An uncomfortable moment
passes.

EXT. CUBAN STREET - MORNING

This street in Havana is like a Caribbean tourist city with
no indication of the revolution in progress.

Michael walks along the street, alone, past the Cubans on
their way to work; past the American ladies who have gotten
up early for their shopping spree.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         I could never move - I've got too 
                         much stuff.

               Enid notices an extremely ugly modern sculpture in the corner. 
               She goes over and picks it up.

                                     ENID
                         Where did you get this?

                                     SEYMOUR
                         Dana bought it when we went antique 
                         shopping. She said it didn't go with 
                         her stuff, so she gave it to me... 
                         she thought it fit in better with my 
                         "old time thingamajigs."

                                     ENID
                         Jesus, how can you stand her?

               Seymour takes another slug off the bottle.

                                     SEYMOUR
                         God, she's going to kill me... this 
                         bottle is half-empty!

                                     ENID
                         That's great! "Half-empty" - that's 
                         what I like about you, Seymour, you're 
                         a natural pessimist!

                                     SEYMOUR
                         If you expect the worst, you're never 
                         disappointed.

        Carrie opens the door to find a DELIVERY MAN standing there
        with a very large dress box tied by a lush RIBBON.

                            CARRIE (V.O.)
                  And then the impossible happened.

        JUMP CUT TO: Carrie pulling back the tissue paper to reveal:
        her favorite wedding gown. Carrie picks up a hand-written
        note on an engraved note card from VIVIENNE WESTWOOD. It
        reads: "I saw the photos from the shoot. This dress belongs
        to you. Cheers!"


45      INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT/CLOSET -- LATER -- SUMMER            45

        Carrie peeks around the closet and looks in. The gown is
        hanging next to the white suit, dwarfing it.

                            CARRIE (V.O.)
                  And just like that, Vivienne

     Big leads Carrie into their new bedroom by the hand. Her eyes
     are closed and she has a DESIGNER shopping bag slung over her
     one arm. He moves her around the construction debris,
     stopping in front of the new closet's double doors.

                         BIG
               Okay. Open them.

     Carrie opens her eyes.

                         CARRIE
               Double door. So far so good.

     She opens the closet doors, revealing a beautiful oversized,
     walk-in closet with shelves and more shelves and places for
     shoes and more shoes.

               Well. You did me proud, Mister.

                          BIG
               Like it?

                         CARRIE
               Like it? It's love at first sight.

     He smiles, proud. She takes the DESIGNER shoe box out of her
     shopping bag and hands it to him. She opens the lid, takes
     out a pair of COLORFUL/FUN HEELS and places them on the
     shelf. She turns back to him.

                          CARRIE (CONT'D)
               Now, I believe this is all really
               happening.

     Miranda, Charlotte and Carrie are standing in Carrie's
     apartment. Empty boxes are everywhere. Lily is coloring
     quietly nearby.

                         MIRANDA
               I can't believe it sold so fast.

                         CHARLOTTE
               It's a sign.

      Samantha strolls along Rodeo Drive.

                                             98A.


                    CARRIE (V.O.)
          And in an effort to stay out of her
          house and out of trouble --
          Samantha went shopping.

She notices a sidewalk "dog rescue station." Cute puppies
frolic and play in a wire pen.

                                                       99.


      In the back of the pen sits a tattered tiny DOG.   Alone.
      Samantha can't help but look at it.

                          CARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                It certainly wasn't the cutest dog
                in the pen - but their was
                something about it --

      The dog looks up at her -- Dark marks under its eyes. The
      Rescue Woman (40) notices Samantha looking.

                          RESCUE WOMAN
                She needs a good a home.
                Interested?

      Samantha shakes her head; "no."

      The dog looks up at her. She looks down at it.

                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    (to dog)
                Honey, I don't mince words.


153   EXT. RODEO DRIVE -- LATER -- FALL                            153

      Samantha and the dog walk out of Gucci in matching outfits...
      looking fabulous. Three GUCCI SALESMEN follow them holding
      large Gucci bags. They walk to her sleek Mercedes SUV --
      parked at the curb.

                                             99A.


JUMP CUT TO: The back of the Mercedes SUV filled with
shopping bags: Gucci, Prada, Dior -- the SUV hatch is closed,
revealing Samantha's licence plate: I HEART NY. Samantha
pulls away, the dog in her lap -- fur blowing.

                                                    100.

      Carrie and Louise are in the closet unloading clothes from
      the boxes. Carrie opens a wardrobe box -- It's the WEDDING
      GOWN. They both look at it - not knowing what to do.

                Do you want me to get rid of it?

      The HOT TATTOOED LATIN GUY is still sitting on the stoop out
      front with the ferocious looking pitbull. She starts up the
      stairs. He checks her out. She turns.

                          SAMANTHA
                Hi, I'm your new neighbor.

      They smile. There is a connection. Samantha looks down. The
      dog is humping the pitbull. Diego nods approval.

      A very, very pregnant Charlotte carrying shopping bags is
      being seated at a banquette by the HOSTESS (26).

                    (touched; embarrassed)
                Oh, thank-you.

      The Hostess walks away as Charlotte settles in and looks
      around. Her eyes WIDEN. Big is sitting across the room at a
      table -- alone. He hasn't seen her. Charlotte starts to panic
      as the WAITRESS (20's) comes over.

                          WAITRESS
                Hi, can I --

                          CHARLOTTE
                No, I'm sorry -- I can't stay --
                Help me -- pull out the table. I
                can't --

      Charlotte pulls herself up off the banquette. As she tries to
      slide out, her belly and shopping bags knock things off the
      table. Crash. DINERS looks. Big spots her -- their eyes meet.
      She moves away as quickly as she can through the room. He
      gets up and follows after her.


224   EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE RESTAURANT -- DAY -- SPRING            224

      Charlotte exits the restaurant -- visibly upset. Big is
      quickly on her heels.

                          BIG
                Charlotte. Charlotte wait --

      He catches up to her - and gently steps to her.

                          BIG (CONT'D)
                You're pregnant -- don't run.

                          CHARLOTTE
                I don't want to see you.

      She starts crying and talking though the tears.

      She puts the phone down and is about to "delete" the e mail --

INT. PARSONAGE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

A Christmas tree with large colored lights stand in a
corner. Jamie and her father playing cards. The DOORBELL
RINGS. Then urgent BANGING.

shopping bag. Holds it out to Jamie.

                    (awkward)
             It's a present. Take it.

She does. She opens the bag, pulls out a beautiful pink
sweater. She's overwhelmed.

Without a word, just a happy smile, Landon hops down the
steps toward his car. Reverend Sullivan appears in the
doorway.

                           LANDON
                    (calling back)

             I'm not going back to school.

Landon and her father both turn to her.      Pale, wane.   They
understand what she is saying.

                           JAMIE
             You can tell anyone you want.   I
             don't care.

She goes into the house. Landon and Reverend Sullivan
look at each other, then away, uncomfortable. That didn't
sound like her.


INT. BEAUFORT HIGH - HALLWAY - MONDAY MORNING

Landon, looking haggard, moves slowly as he cleans out
Jamie's locker.

Students stare as he carefully places her things,
including the pink sweater, in a shopping bag. They part
and hush as he passes by. News travels fast. Clay and
Eric step forward.

We hear the shower. Steam pours out the open bathroom door.

EXT. JERRY FABIN'S HOUSE - MID-DAY

The sun is high; the day is bright and hazy.   A few hippies
stroll by or sit on front steps, discreetly smoking joints.
We hear the distant sound of Jerry's shower.

INT. JERRY FABIN'S BATHROOM - LATER

Jerry is still in the shower, scrubbing away. He finally
turns it off and steps out, a drowned rat. He dries
himself, wipes the mirror and squints nervously at his
reflection. Tiny bugs hop around on his head. He screams.

INT. JERRY FABIN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

Jerry lies on the cruddy shag carpet, open volumes of the
Encyclopedia Brittanica spread around him. He scratches
himself as he studies one of the volumes. Insects hop up and
down all over his body, and on the rug. When he exhales, a
cloud of bugs pours from his mouth; he shoos them away.

EXT. JERRY FABIN'S HOUSE - DAY

Jerry heads up the walkway carrying a shopping bag. Several
cans of Raid and other bug sprays poke out of the bag. Bugs
hop around on Jerry. He puts the bag down on the stoop to
scratch himself. He notices tiny bugs chewing the shrubs.

It's a mess. Freck is on the couch smoking a joint. A cat
sleeps in his lap. Another cat and a dog lie on either side
of him. A disassembled cephscope is on the coffee table,
wires exposed. Barris hovers over the dining room table
where he has set up a makeshift chemistry lab.

     capital of the Abruzzo region and the nearest big town to
     Castel del Monte and Castelveccio.

     Like these two villages L'AQUILA is relatively isolated,

      Margaret lifts up Jodie, who's desperately trying to get at the hat.

              She just wants that bacon.

      A large sign outside advertises "Fresh Moose Meat". Paul runs out with a
      shopping bag, jumps in his car and drives off.

56    EXT. BOTTOM OF THE RIDGE - SUNSET                                             56

      Paul, carrying the shopping bag, he painfully picks his way down the rock face
      toward the corpse.

                                  PAUL
                        (really bad British accent)
              You may want to take a gander.  You may want to

      THE BACON HAT -- as Paul pulls it snug on the corpse's head.  He pulls the
      bloody steaks from the shopping bag and starts to smear them on the corpse's
      parka.  Drops of blood hit the snow at the body's feet and disappear.

      Paul drapes the steaks on the body, tucking one under an arm, the other
      hanging from a pocket. He pauses for moment, then pulls out a container of
      lard and, fighting his own revulsion, smears it across the dead man's face.

                                  PAUL
              Sorry about this part.

      Paul pats the body on the shoulder, then looks up at the ridge and the long
      journey ahead.

                I got them a camper, and all they wanted to do 
                was hang out in it by themselves. So I wasn't 
                too upset when they took that wrong turn and 
                went over a cliff.

       You know, I think I saw her the other day, your room-mate.
       You were leaving the building. Then I thought it was you.

       Oh !... That's Hedy. I really freaked her out about people

The elevator stops.

            I know for a fact that's not true.
            I've seen you feel joy, I've seen
            you marvel at things. You just
            might not see it at this exact
            time, but that's understandable.
            You've been through a lot lately.

                    It's the modern way of life. We
                    surround ourselves with people. A
                    constant din of conversation. As if
                    we need the mirror of other faces to
                    see ourselves. The clamor of voices
                    in our ears to reassure us that we
                    exist. Do we need it? Can we live

          Aurora. He scowls at the ring.

             bus downtown to do your shopping.  You always
             use the express lane because you never have 
             more than ten items.

             No, for you I had to be sure.  For Kurt

          Every day I think I see her.
          Driving to work in the car next to
          me. At mass. Shopping, I see

The Woman lays a hand on his arm, looks him in the eye.
There is something formidable about her.

            Look, can I help you?  If you're
            suffering over something, will you
            share it with me?

She touches his hand; Elliot embraces her.

                         ELLIOT
            Hannah, you know how much I love
            you.
                   (kissing her on the forehead)
            I ought to have my head examined.
            I don't deserve you.

Elliot kisses Hannah again; they embrace tightly.  She
touches his hair.

The screen shows a metal staircase next to a large white
column.  Holly's voice can be heard as she and Hannah make
their way up the stairs, moving into view.  A man carrying a
shopping bag walks down the steps; he passes them.  Hannah
and Holly talk as they climb.

                         HOLLY
                   (offscreen)
            You know, I just want to look so
            good, but I don't want to seem, you
            know, like I'm overdressed.
                   (onscreen, walking up
                   the stairs behind Hannah)
            You know what I'm saying?
                         HANNAH
                   (overlapping, turning
                   to look at Holly)
            Oh, no, not at all.

                   (holding up a dress
                   she's carrying on her arm)
            Well, how about this?

                         HANNAH
                   (looking at the dress)
            Well, I, I really like that.  I
            think that's a pretty color on you.

                              CLERK #2

      The Abbott house is decked with snow. Doug sits    behind
      the wheel of the Plymouth. He's parked down the    street.

But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet. 

He holds up his own card. 

PRICE 
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...

BATEMAN 
(Choking with anxiety) 
Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.

Price pulls a card from an inside coat pocket and holds it 
up for their inspection: "PAUL OWEN, PIERCE &amp; PIERCE, 
MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS." Bateman swallows, speechless. 
The sound in the room dies down and all we hear is a faint 
heartbeat as Bateman stares at the magnificent card.

BATEMAN (V.O.) 
Look at that subtle off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness 
of it. Oh my God, it even has a watermark...

His hand shaking, Bateman lifts up the card and stares at it 
until it fills the screen.

He lets it fall. The SOUND RETURNS TO NORMAL.

CARRUTHERS Is something wrong? Patrick...you're sweating.

EXT. STREET- EVENING 

The financial district. The streets are eerily deserted.

Bateman stands at an ATM, enjoying the reassuring sound of 
$500 in fresh bills thudding from the machine. As he turns 
to leave, he notices someone across the street.

A HOMELESS MAN is lying in a doorway on top of an open 
grate, surrounded by bags of garbage and a shopping cart. A 
cardboard sign is attached to the front of the cart: I AM 
HOMELESS AND HUNGRY PLEASE HELP ME. A small, thin dog lies 
next to him.

He is black, dressed in a stained, torn, lime-green 
polyester pants suit with jeans worn over the pants.

BATEMAN 
(Offering his hand) Hello. Pat Bateman.

The Homeless Man stares at Bateman, struggling to sit up.

BATEMAN 
You want some money?. Some...food?

The Homeless Man nods and starts to cry. Bateman reaches 
into his pocket and pulls out a $I 0 bill, then changes his 
mind and holds out a $5 instead.

BATEMAN 
Is this what you need?

The Homeless Man nods, looks away, wipes his nose.

HOMELESS MAN 
I'm so hungry.

            There is a definite obligation,
            when you boom around Vegas in a
            white Coupe de Ville, to maintain a
            certain style.

DUKE and GONZO burst out of the supermarket riding a shopping
basket loaded with COCONUTS, GRAPEFRUIT and TEQUILA.  They
send DEFEATED SHOPPERS sprawling.

The trolley collides into the WHITE WHALE.  SHOPPERS gather
at the supermarket entrance to watch -- baskets loaded with
junk, SCREAMING KIDS and EMPTY WALLETS.

DUKE switches on the music: JUMPING JACK FLASH.  He selects
a coconut -- ceremonially balances it on the hood.  GONZO
pulls out a silver claw-hammer.  A sly look at the gathering
CROWD... then he smashes the hammer down on the coconut!

A GASP from the surly SHOPPERS.

DUKE places another coconut.  SMASH!  Milk and white meat
flies everywhere.

                         SHOPPER #1

            Any of you folks want the milk?
            We're after the meat.  This is
            honest coconut essence.  Real meat.

SMASH!
