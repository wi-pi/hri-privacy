           cone. They watch as he draws a line in the snow from the

                         DAVE
          I don't think I'll go to the
          race. I should be here when
          Papa wakes up.

          1 RS . BLASE
          No, I don't think you should.
          Here, did I ever show you this.
          She takes a passport out of her purse on the table.

                         DAVE
          It's a passport.

          MRS. BLASE
          They're quite cheap, you know.
          A real bargain. I eep carrying
          it with me. One of these days
          there'll be a new girl at the
          IGA and when I want to cash a
          check she'll ask me for some
          Indentification and I'll take
          out my passport and say: Here.
          Won't that be something.
          Dave is moved by this gesture: By the spirit of yearning for
          travel that it implies and by the knowledge that she will
          probably not go anywhere.

                         DAVE
          Oh, Mama...

              I have a friend there.

Customs looks at Creasy a moment. He doesn't look like a
man who has 'friends'. Finally, customs smiles.

             I cannot see your eyes, Senor.

Creasy slips off the sunglasses. His eyes are deserted.
Inevitable. Customs can only look into them a moment.
He indicates for Creasy to put his bags on a conveyor
belt leading to an X-ray machine. Creasy lifts his bag
onto the conveyor. The official hits the start button.
The bag drives forward towards the X-ray machine.

Creasy pauses, then offers up a license from his wallet.

Polaroid FLASH

Shot of Creasy straight on.     Shot of Creasy profile.

FLASH.   Fingers being fingerprinted.

JUMPCUTS - suitcase being stripped and ripped (MIDNIGHT
EXPRESS), pack of Marlboro, bottle of Jack Daniels,
glimpse a weathered Bible (New Testament), intercut with
seven pieces of blue steel separated in different parts
of the bag, ie. toiletries, underwear, lining of
suitcase.

The seven pieces laid together look remarkably like a
well travelled Sig Sauer 226. Creasy smiles.

Pinta smiles huge, nods.

                            PINTA
               In between you can take Mom shopping and
               to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr.

               Looks like he approves of you.

And then, walking on air, she's out the door.

Creasy sets up his room with meticulous precision that
comes from years in the military. Front and center he
arranges his shrine: an almost empty bottle of scotch and
a glass (engraved from an earlier encounter) next to a
pack of Marlboros and his weathered Zippo. Then, his
beaten up gun and holster. A well-travelled New
Testament is placed in the drawer.

He reaches in between the shirts, pulls out a fresh
bottle of scotch. He breaks the seal, unscrews the cap.

He pours a double... triple... wait, what do you call a
full glass of scotch?

CAW!   The macaw squawks it's disapproval.

He ejects the shell from the breach of the 9mm, tries to
catch it on the back of his hand. An old game with
himself.

His hand is too shaky. The bullet bounces off, hits the
floor. Creasy picks it up. Ejecting the magazine, he
starts to oil the weapon.

CAW! As the macaw squawks, Creasy looks up. It doesn't
feel like this relationship is going to work.

CREASY'S ROOM

Creasy's drinking in the dark next to the window,
listening to the sounds of Mexico City at night.

The empty scotch glass is set down.    Ominously sober.

INT. PINTA'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

Brushing her hair, Pinta wanders to the window at the
sound of a car hood closing. Creasy is down below going
over the car; a dark BLUE MERCEDES. As he checks
underneath...

The "Car Wash Guy", Pedro, trying to engage Creasy.
Frank looks on, seems like he disapproves of Pedro.

INT.   MERCEDES - DAY

Creasy sits grimly behind the wheel. Pinta exuberant
beside him. Traveling route number one from home base to
school. Pinta looks at Creasy's hands on the wheel. The
back of the right one is swirled with scars.

                          PINTA
             Where are you from, Creasy?

             I know.    But which state?

Creasy checks the rearview mirror. A banged up white
TOYOTA COROLLA pulls out behind him.

                          CREASY
             No state in particular.

Pinta frowns; this is going to take some work.

EXT.   MERCEDES - RAMOS HOUSE - DAY

Pedro the 'car wash guy' puts the finishing touches to
the Mercedes.

Using crutches, Pinta hobbles over. Creasy opens the
back door for her. But when she gets there, she
hesitates.

                          PINTA
             I think I'll sit in the front.     There's
             more room for my foot.

Creasy makes no big deal of it. He takes her crutches,
opens the front. As she scoots inside... Frank waits
and watches. Creasy calls to him.

RUDY BEGINS TO SMILE. FRAN IS NEXT TO RUDY WITHIN THE bed,
wearing only a bra, sleeping, one arm wrapped around Rudy's
middle.

                    RUDY
          How you doing over there, Harold? You
          sleep okay last night? Good. I'm glad to
          hear it. Did you listen to the news? That
          means we don't have to drive so hard
          today, Harold... we're gonna be
          travelling a lot faster than they are...
          We got a lot more time than I figured.

Rudy continues smiling. He pulls the sheet away from Frank,
then allows his hand to reach down, cupping her breast from
inside the bra. Fran half awakens, pulls herself closer to
Rudy.

                            BLOOM
                  It just seems like a big leap.
                  From where you were at yesterday to
                  being a world traveler.

                  Apologies, but the deck was dark,

                      (English)
                  It's been such a time since I've
                  encountered the Brothers Bloom.

                            PENELOPE
                  You're in antiques?

                  you know the true nature of the men
                  you travel with?

     The band strikes up a Bolero. The Curator flicks his wrist,
     and a long thin blade falls into his hand.

                            THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                  A little fear might suit you, I
                  think.

     He raises the blade... it is in fact a fine mustache brush,
     which he delicately employs.

                            THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                  Bon soir, ma cherie.

     With that the Curator backs into the shadows, and is gone.
     Moments later Bloom trots up to her, oblivious.

                            BLOOM
                  It isn't a Spanish band, but
                  they'll do their best.

     He hands her a single blood red rose. She puts it in her
     teeth, and they dance. If there is a tinge of tension in the
     air, the Bolero suits it.

     The moon ducks behind a cloud once more, and they dance on in
     the dark.

                   just skip out on us, not do
                   something tacky like fake his own
                   death.

      Poking around the room, Bloom opens a closet. The Curator
      stands pressed against the back wall in his pajamas.

                             THE CURATOR
                       (sotto)

                   eight hours till we traded the
                   million for the book, and had some
                   traveling money. Well. Back to

          In whatever lies ahead, the United

          A large ballroom at a Washington hotel. It's a lunch

           SECRETARY OF DEFENSE (CONT'D)
          They have suffered years of brutal

          At the head table: Reza Barhani; Tommy Barton of CONNEX;

          SECRETARY OF DEFENSE (CONT'D)
          A new regime would bring
          deliverance for Iran. Iranian
          resources are abundant, its
          culture is rich, its citizens are
          talented. And given a chance,
          there is no limit to what the

All silent; MIKE on "watch".  Just him and a wooden desk
chair, the grade-school variety.  No books, no crossword
puzzles; he came unprepared.  He checks his watch and
looks to an ornate wall clock.  And he's bored.  He picks
up an empty coffee cup, looking for a last drop.  Settles
for sniffing it.  Replaces it on the floor beside him.
Then he looks to the closed doors of the apartment and
makes a decision.  Picking up the coffee cup, he quietly
pushes the DOORS OPEN, and ENTERS.

As MIKE pads quietly across the marble floors in the
quiet; pausing to gaze, in awe, at the vast, empty LIVING
ROOM.  It is gigantic, his eyes roaming the ceilings, as
though to estimate their height.

Moving inward, his eyes fall on a BOOK RACK, and he
crosses to it, perusing the shelves for possible reading
material.

They're all ART BOOKS, the big, thick kind.  A Renoir,
because of a NUDE FIGURE on the cover, catches his eye.
But as he pulls it out and begins to leaf through -- he
HEARS VOICES.  CLAIRE'S and NEIL'S; her tone is agitated.

Joe leans across, snapping his gum as he offers her a stick.
He watches her nibble it daintily on her front teeth.

	Thank you.

Towny hurries across the room to the bedside table. Beside
the telephone is a picture of a prosperous pioneer woman
wearing a hearing-aid.
Towny tries to conceal his movements as he takes a wallet
from the drawer, lifts out a bill and tucks the wallet back
and turns -- terrified to see Joe close behind him -- almost
knocking the lamp off the table in his fright. Pressed
against the table, protecting but calling attention to his
wallet, Towny holds out the bill.

A hip young woman with her forehead wrapped in a headband

Maurice is a bit pale.  He follows the yellow highlighted
highways winding it's way across the U.S.

          Perhaps there's another route?

    younger wife, the COUNTESS SOFYA, favorite daughter SASHA,
    and his personal physician DUSHAN MAKOVITSKY. Sasha and
    Dushan write in their diaries. Sofya looks from one to the

                         Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds. 
                         They travel up and down the coast 
                         with the seasons.

                         The trick to Mr. Rose is, you have 
                         to let him be the boss.

               Homer wonders what that means as Wally reaches for the door 
               of the cider house. Before Wally can knock, a pretty young 
               black girl, ROSE ROSE, bumps open the screen door with her 
               hip and throws a bucket of water in the grass--almost hitting

                         plumber.

                         Rose, this is Homer--Homer, this is 
                         Mr. Rose's daughter, Rose.

                                     HOMER

                         YOUNG PASSENGER (O.S.)
            I'm going to put it right up to
            her, cabbie. Right in her, cabbie.
            You must think I'm real sick, huh?
            A real pervert. Sitting here and
            talking about a woman's pussy and a
            .44, huh?

CAMERA CLOSES IN on Travis' face: He is watching the woman
in the seventh floor window with complete and total
absorption. It's the same glazed-over stare we saw in his
eyes as he watched the porno movie.

                                            FADE TO:

BROOKLYN STREET CORNER - DAY

Travis stands near the corner wearing his boots, jeans,
western shirt and army jacket.

He pulls his aspiring bottle out of his pocket, shakes three
or four into his palm, pops them into his mouth and chews.

An "Off Duty" taxi pulls up to the curb. Travis gets in.

INSIDE TAXI

Dough-Boy leans back from the wheel and greets Travis as he
enters.

                         DOUGH-BOY
            Hey Travis. This here's Easy Andy.
            He's a travelling salesman.

In the back seat, beside Travis, sits ANDY, an attractive
young man about 29. He wears a pin-striped suit, white shirt
and floral tie. His hair is modishly long.

                                                           51.


                         ANDY
            Hello Travis.

Travis nods as the taxi speeds off.

Dough-Boy slows down near an economy hotel. Not a flop
house, but not do fancy they care what the guests do in the
privacy of their rooms.

                         ANDY
            This is fine, Dough-Boy
                   (to Travis)
            Pay Dough-Boy here.

Travis pulls a twenty out of his pocket and gives it to
Dough-Boy.

               Me too. I'm glad you suggested it.

               I signed all the papers and I
               brought them for you to sign.

               I'm a really slow signer. It took

               letter T.

               the sky until it is above the falling snow and moving slowly

               People are crowded into the rooms: family, friends, neighbors.  
               There is a din of conversation. Mary and George appear at 
               the top of the stairs in traveling clothes, with Mrs. Hatch, 
               red-eyed, behind them. Mary throws her bouquet, which is 
               caught by Violet Bick. As they come out onto the porch, we 
               see that it is raining.  Nevertheless, Cousin Eustace has 
               his camera equipment set up and is taking pictures of the

               A joke can be the ultimate intellectual pursuit sometimes.  This? 
                This is just a job offer.  In your top drawer there's an envelope

               BRANDON opens the drawer, pulls an envelope and a ticket.

               That's travel cash and an airline ticket.  It's not a magic trick,

               wasting your time there, Brandon, unless

               talents and weigh the odds of that dream becoming reality.  Two 
               leg fractures?  Passed on by every conceivable team in the league? 
                Any chump can make that call, and anyone who clears the boards 
               the way you do week in and week out should live in a penthouse 
               on Park Avenue -- which is not for you to construe I'm offering 
               that to start, but keep these stats up working for me and I'll 
               have you in one in less than a year.  Unless of course you're

     Pi eats a banana from the food set aside for the animals in
     the cargo hold. He sits next to the transport cage of ORANGE
     JUICE, a female orangutan with a baby orang in her arms.
     Animal crates and cages surround Pi, the air filled with
     screeches and growls.

     Father enters the hold, carrying food for the animals.

               India must have been harder for him

          For what?
          Perseus doesn't notice the black widow spider scurry
          between her feet. Then a centipede, a scorpion. Then a
          swarm, racing toward him.
          He feels the first spider and looks down. The creatures
          climb his legs, biting. Weakening from the venom, he
          stumbles back into the table, loses his balance and
          falls.

          A white sail, swollen with wind, draws the small boat
          swiftly across the sea. The Wilting Girl, alone, sits
          quietly at the stern, effortlessly steering.

                         CLOSER
          We SEE that she is also watching Perseus, who is sleeping
          in a makeshift bed in the bottom of the boat. Her eyes
          slowly travel over his bronzed, muscled frame. There are
          bite marks on his legs and arms, but they seem to be
          healing as we look at them.
          Perseus stirs and wakes, squinting up at the Wilting

           Do you get lonely?

Speck's so thrown now he can't answer.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Ya miss fucking her, Harold?

                     SPECK
           Listen, I don't know who you are but you
           can't--

O'Ryan silences him... by holding up a piece of paper. On it
is a DRAWING. The image faces away from us. But Speck can see
it in rich detail. And his eyes go wide.

We catch GLIMPSES: The color of flesh. A body-part. Looks like
a rendering of a young, naked WOMAN.

And, just like that, Speck finds himself STARING. Glued.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Did it myself. It's sort of a hobby.
               (no reply)
           I've got more. Would you like to see
           them?

O'Ryan lowers it and slides a SECOND DRAWING over... Speck is
speechless, transfixed. Can't look away.

                      O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Tell me: those jokes about the traveling
           salesman and the farmer's daughter - are
           they true?

               (Speck remains silent)
           Here. This one's my favorite.

O'Ryan slides over DRAWING #3. Again, we don't get to see it.
And we still haven't seen all of O'Ryan's face.

But we can see Speck, and his reaction. Utter horror. In fact
he recoils so violently that his coffee spills.

           to point us at something. Starkey's part
           of it. But the other two don't connect.

           this through with me! He wanted to meet
           me. It's like he was interviewing me
           somehow. What is that? Then he kills
           Starkey. So what was he doing with Speck
           and Fulcher?

          Yes. She told me about a vision she had
          when she found out her daughter had
          died ...she saw herself at a great
          distance from the earth encircling
          it, an endless line - as she got closer
          she saw that it was made up of mothers
          traveling forward. She fell into line,
          and began walking with them. When they
          reached a certain point, the line
          divided. She said she knew - that all the
          millions of women on her side - were the
          mothers who had lost children-she
          seemed to find great comfort in that.

               - shoving through to where people are yelling and clustered
               around a figure lying on the floor.
               Willy pushes closer, until he catches glimpses of:
               Nunally.   Lying on the marble floor. His gun in his lifeless
               fingers.   Blood all over, from his head.
               Willy stops pushing. Won't let himself look away - the
               screams and commotion around him retreating into a numb blur.

                         Well? How do you like it? It's 
                         Turkish. My hairdresser tells me 
                         everything's going to be Turkish 
                         this year!

                         today? Give me some gossip.

                                     CAVALIERI
                         Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.

                         And he's been commissioned to write 
                         an opera. Is it true?

                                     SALIERI

                         VANGER
           Isn't it interesting how fascists
           always steal the word freedom.
                (Blomkvist checks his watch)
           The 4:30. Yes. Okay. Anyway,
           Richard died a martyr to the Nazi
           cause in 1940 - missed all the real
           excitement - but not the opportunity
           to regularly beat his wife Margareta
           and their son, Gottfried.

We see photos of Gottfried, a handsome young man.

                         VANGER
           Now, Gottfried - Harriet's father -
           was what people used to call a Good-
           Time-Charlie.

                         BLOMKVIST
           They're still called that.
                          VANGER
           Are they?   Okay.
INSERT:   Close on a photo of Gottfried.

                         VANGER
           He was a charmer, a ladies man, a
           drunk. In other words, a born
           salesman - which is what he did for
           the company - traveling around,
           taking clients out to dinner and so
           on.

                         BLOMKVIST
           Someone has to do it.
                        VANGER
           That's right. Anyway, he died in
           1965. Drowned. Drunk. Here on the
           island.
A studio photo: Gottfried with his wife and two children.

                         VANGER
           His wife Isabella - who was pretty
           much useless before as a parent -
           became even more so after his death -
           which is when I began looking after
           their children - Martin - who runs
           Vanger Industries now that I'm
           retired - and Harriet.
                                                             20.

       Isabella gives the nurse a look so hard it's almost
       frightening - calmly flicks an ash on the floor - waits

                Anita married in Stockholm in 1967.
                It's recorded in the Swedish General
                Register. But the family never knew,
                did they.
                     (she confirms that with a
                      shake of her head)
                I'm guessing she then came here on a
                passport in her married name, and you
                followed on her maiden name passport.
                              HARRIET
                Actually, it was the other way
                around. She thought it safer for me
                to travel with Spencer myself.

                              BLOMKVIST
                What did he think about that?
                              HARRIET
                Nothing. Only that he loved her.
                She said, If you love me, you'll do
                this and not ask why. He never did.

                They both died twenty years ago.

      Blomkvist nods, reaches for something in his jacket
      pocket - changes his mind - changes it again and pulls it
      out.

looking down as it travels along a hallway and turns into

          You know, for when you travel.

                     KELLY
          For when I travel?

She can't believe it.  It's the exact opposite of what she
wanted.

                     KELLY
          You should have got me something that
          shows you want us to be together, not
          apart.

Chuck is flummoxed.  Women read so much into things.

                     CHUCK
          I wasn't sending a message.  I though
          you'd like it.

Chuck's beeper goes off.

                     KELLY
          You should have got me a ring.

He checks the number.

                     CHUCK
          I have to go.  I'm on call for overflow
          down at the Hub.

                     CHUCK
          When I was going crazy, on the raft, I'd
          argue with myself about everything.
          Because everything had a price.  To get
          anything -- a sip of water, a little
          corner of shade, an hour's sleep -- I had
          to let go of something else.  And then I
          could never get it back.

He thinks some more.

                     CHUCK
          You don't win or lose.  You win and lose.

He looks out the window.

                     CHUCK
          You win and lose.

And Chuck has.  Big time.

EXT.  MEMPHIS AIRPORT - NIGHT

A FedEx MD-11 lands.

EXT.  MEMPHIS SUPERHUB - MOMENTS LATER

The MD-11 taxis up.  As usual, the SuperHub is a frenzy of
activity.  A loading crew stands ready, forklifts poised.
Even this plane carries packages.

PHIL STEELE, the chairman of FedEx, Leslie, Becca, Dick, and
other executives wait on a special podium near the gangway.
Everyone looks different -- older, a mustache here, a
thickening around the belly there.

Behind a barrier a cluster of cameras film the scene.

The plane cuts its engine.  The stairs are rolled out.
Forklifts and gangways move forward.  Cargo doors open.
Chuck appears in the door.  He holds the FedEx Package and a
small travel bag.

Chuck blinks against the lights and the glare.  Stan is right
by him.  Everyone bursts into APPLAUSE AND CHEERING.

After four years of total solitude this is completely
overwhelming.

                     STAN
          Smile.

Chuck smiles.

                     STAN
          Wave.

And Chuck waves.  He's overwhelmed by all the input.  Stan
steers Chuck down the steps as the cheers continue.

At the bottom of the steps Roger steps forward.  The two
brothers embrace each other.  After a moment Roger
disengages.  Mary gives Chuck a hug.

                     MARY
          Oh Chuck --

                         ALEX
          ... I'm trying here, Jason -- I

          go to college, I took your side, I

          college, and I've done all right.
          I gave you a job', a steady check,
          which is more than anybody else has
          done. And what do I get back?
          Shit. I've tried to teach you the

          Jason laughs dismissively.

There was a lot of work done on it in the 7Os. I can't recall the details

If you could unlock it, you could physically travel back down it. Through
evolution - like a time machine.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

You were right, Luc. That work you remembered from Berkeley - he was the
one that did it. He said man was the last step on an evolutionary trail.
Within every one of us is the history of our race. It's imprinted on our
genes - like a map. Anyone that can find the chemical key can travel back
down it. Through the womb. Through time and space -

That's what he's doing. He's going back. He's going to try and change
evolution.

DIAMOND

He was the best of his generation. He thinks so. He's got the genetic
material for the key. All he needs are flotation tanks.

THE FLOTATION TANKS

The valves are open - warm water is pouring into the tanks.

Will sits next to the rack of medical equipment, beads of sweat on his
forehead. He slides a syringe into his forearm and inserts a catheter. He
opens a series of tiny valves on the glass vials. A cocktail of fluid -
minutely measured doses - flows down the clear plastic towards his arm. The
fluid hits his blood stream and drains into it.

Smack! They push through the doors, into another corridor.

AN IRON LADDER

Will climbs up the side of the flotation tank. Suddenly he stops - a
tremor, a rippling wave, passes from his feet to his head. It's his muscles
contracting. It wracks him with pain. He gasps at the intensity of it.

Smash! The steel door into the basement shudders as someone tries to get
in. Will looks up - the door twists and moves. His vision is starting to
distort. He grabs the access hatch and swings through -

heartbeat. The water sloshes back and forth - his muscles are going into
spasms. We push along his body - up to his face. His eyes roll back into
his headl

of the tank. It's like the womb. His body seems to be disintegrating,
dissolving into it. Water flows through the sockets where his eyes once
were.

His hollow mouth opens. From far away we hear him scream - a primal scream.

Will's body is like a shadow, almost one with the water, growing less
distinct by the moment. What is left of his face - a strange, shifting
shape - floats towards us. Closer... closer. It melts completely into the
water -

shatters into a million fragments of light. It looks like a comet, wheeling
through the heavens. A cosmic wind blows it forward. Will is traveling
through space and time -

OUTSIDE THE TANK

Diamond and the others are gathered around the computers. Bob is working
the keyboard. Diamond is looking.through the piles of papers, notes and
star charts.

DIAMOND

Everything's here - he kept a record of every step. He can even tell the
date -forty hours after he arrives there's a solar eclipse.

BOB

Billie - there's a note for you.

Diamond looks over his shoulder at the computer screen. She reads what is
writ'ten -

DIAMOND

"I won't be here, but if I solve this thing make sure you tell them,
Billie. Tell them it was Robert Plant, Doctor Robert Plant of UC Berkeley."

APES HANG FROM THE 'LADDERS'

looking down on Drak and his troops. The convoy passes along a road cut
into the side of the ridge. Apes have come out of the houses and buildings
to greet them.

Will lies in the back of the cart, unconscious. Faces of apes stare in at
him - they've never seen anything like it. A young ape - a little boy -
stands with his grandfather.

KID

What is it?

GRANDFATHER

Some... sort of human.

KID

But look at the eyes, 'Pa - they're the color of the sea. Where's it from?

GRANDFATHER

I don't know - a traveler, maybe. Nobody knows what lies beyond the Tower
of the Moon.

THE WORD "TRAVELER" IS PICKED UP BY OTHER APES. IT RIPPLES THROUGH THE
CROWD. A WOMAN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WAGON CALLS OUT -

WOMAN

No it's not - it's a mutant.

LABORER

Put it in the zoo!

A female ape pushes them aside. She's heavy-set, bright eyes, an air of
authority about her. Over her shoulder she carries a leather satchel with a
series of steel instruments dangling from it. Her name is ZORA - she is a
doctor.

She and her ASSISTANT - a young male - swing themselves on to the cart.
Kneeling beside him, Zora puts her hand down and grabs hold of Will's
crotch.

People have been wrong about a lot of things.

THE GREAT VALLEY

stretches out below - primordial forests and cascading streams. Will and
Diamond stand on a rock ledge outside the cave.

WILL (CONT'D)

This is the rift valley in Kenya -

He points at the towering, snow-capped peak.

WILL (CONT'D)

That's Kilamanjaro - ten thousand feet higher but a hundred thousand years
of wind and rain will turn it into the mountain we know. Think of it -
we've come back a hundred thousand years! Everyone told me it couldn't be
done, but we've crossed the frontier now - Man has traveled through space
and time. How long has science dreamed of that?

DIAMOND

How long have you?

WILL

All my life.

DIAMOND

Dream no more. You've done it. Like you said in your note - it was Doctor
Robert Plant of UC Berkeley.

WILL turns and looks out at the valley -

Yeah - I really have, haven't I?

Diamond watches him. There's a shout from inside the cave -

A CAVE PAINTING

Newly-drawn, is hidden in e nook high up in the main cave. Strider, Will

ARAGORN

I thought they would leave word for their hunters. Kip-Kena has called a
gathering of the Seven Tribes.

WILL

Where?

ARAGORN

Two days' travel - at the Eagle's Nest.

He looks out through the mouth of the cave - twilight is closing in.

ARAGORN (CONT'D)

We'll stay hera tonight. Be ready to leave at first light.

THE EMBERS OF A FIRE

burn in the circle of stones. Aragorn and Strider are sleeping next to it.
Will and Diamond have been awake all night. They sit in the shadows near
the entrance to the cave, speaking quietly.

DIAMOND

An ape civilization? You said there was a city.., what happened to it all?

WILL

You know what we've found of Aragorn's whole race? Seventeen bones, that's
all. Anthropologists have discovered evidence of the apes - we call them
skulls. Bones last a lot longer than civilizations.

WILL

No - I guess I don't. Not for a long time. Ideas and knowledge are what
matter. They're the shining ideals. That's the only way we progress.

DIAMOND

Progress to what? We're both children of our age, aren't we? We've grown up
to believe the more we know, the more advanced we are. But what does that
mean if we've forgotten the things of real value. You know the reason I
came? It's got nothing to do with science or knowledge. I'm going to have a
child -that's why I'm here.

They look at one another.

DIAMOND (CONT'D)

Uke you said, the women's out there somewhere. Why ere we traveling with
them?

We should cut ourselves loose.

WILL

We wouldn't last a day. We've got to keep moving, Billie. The apes are like
storm-troopers.

DIAMOND

Where are they now?

WILL

Right behind. I think Strider has some sort of tribal intuition. He says he
can hear their hoof beats in his head.

The first rays of dawn pierce the mist from the waterfall. Will and Diamond
turn at a sound behind them - Aragorn is getting up.

Malakai! Bolag!

Two heavily-armed officers emerge from among the soldiers. With Drak they
run for the wall. They leap up the rock face - their massive hands grabbing
tiny ledges.

Other apes follow them. They scramble up the wall with amazing speed.

AN EAGLE CIRCLES

Soaring and hovering in the sky. We tilt down a tribesman - dressed in
skins edged with feathers - is perched high on a jagged peak. He's a
LOOKOUT. He tenses -

Four figures on foot appear on a path cut into the side of a cliff. The
Lookout gives a piercing crythe sound of an eagle. It carries down to -

SERIES OF WOODEN PLATFORMS

are built into the rocky crags, opening into caves. They are connected by
ladders and bridges slung across dizzying drops. The inhabitants here live
with their totem -this is the nest of the Tribe of the Eagle.

The platforms and caves are crowded with the gathering tribes. People turn
at the Lookout's cry. A man pushes through, listening - it's Kip-Kena.

THE LOOKOUT POST

Kip follows the direction of the Lookout's pointing finger. Will and
Diamond lead the other two - all on foot now - along the path.

KIP

It's the traveler! With a woman...

The Lookout shields his eyes against the sun - the visitors ere coming
closer.

The fool - he's brought an ape with himl He reaches for a bow but Kip's
hand falls on his arm, stopping him.

Aragorn!

He turns, yelling down to the platforms -

A WOODEN BRIDGE SWINGS THROUGH THE AIR

Whack! It locks into place on the far side of a deep crevasse. It's a
primitive drawbridge. Aragorn steps on to it, leading the others across.

The tribes-people are gathering, eager to greet him. Then they see Strider.
A ripple of fear and anger runs through them.

ARAGORN

The ape travels with me - treat him as a friend.

Nobody argues with the Ranger. He stops in front of Kip. The young warrior
starts to bow his head but Aragorn stops him. He puts out his arms - they
embrace.

Will crosses the bridge. Kip sees him. He grasps Will's arm in greeting -

KIP

You carry part of my spirit with you -I owe you my life. Welcome, Traveler.

A series of caves, connected by vaulted arches, extend in to the mountain.

A shaft of sunlight strikes a ledge high up the wall. Kip and Will have

All except the Antelope. They hunt the plains far to the west - they have

You're sure? Perhaps some of the women have seen something?

KIP

She looks like you, you say? No offense, Traveler, but the women say you're
the ugliest man they've ever seen. A woman that looks like you - I'm sure
they would have talked about it.

Ugly?

They smile at one another.

KIP

A torch flares below. Kip looks down into an adjoining cave. It's empty
except for a group of men - all warriors - filing in. These are the leaders
of each of the tribes.

ANOTHER TORCH IS LIT

They ring the walls of the small cave. By their light we see the skins, the
feathers and the symbols of each tribe's totem - the eagle, the tiger, the
rainbow...

Beneath each one squats its leader. One place is empty - the Tribe of the
Antelope. Will sits near the entrance. He watches Aragorn - dressed in
ceremonial robes, the Crescent of Light glistening at his neck - rise to
his feet.

ARAGORN

We've traveled without rest - there are soldiers a day behind. The ape says
it's an army.

Great things are moving, Ranger -

An old man, battle-scarred and gray, leans forward. He is the leader of the
Rainbow.

A shaft of moonlight falls on a semi-circle of rock slabs standing on their
end - it's like Stonehenge. The surviving tribes-people are gathered in
their shadow.

OLD MAN

It's half a day since the battle. Any that survived would be here by now -
we are all that remains of the Seven Tribes. The Ranger himself died on the
field. We must decide ourselves what to do.

Silence for a moment. They have spent too long following a leader for
discussion to come easily. Finally, a wounded warrior speaks -

WOUNDED WARRIOR

Like you say, Kip is dead. Maybe it's a sign -the Rangers have left Middle
Earth forever. Perhaps it's telling us to do the same.

A young woman - probably in her 20s - shakes her head.

YOUNG WOMAN

Leave the valley? This is where the eagles fly. This is their home. Nobody
can live without their totem - we all know that!

LOOKOUT

Nobody can live with the apes eitherl If we stay here, we die. But if we
travel beyond the Tower of the Moon, we've got a chance. Who knows - maybe
our totems will follow us?

There's a murmur of agreement. It grows louder, tribes-people nodding their
heads.

THE BEACH

Now we see what Will has been making - it's a boat made out of twigs and
leaves. A tiny hull and a gaff-rigged mast. He leans forward and drops it
in the water. He watches the current carry it away. Farther and farther it
bobs out into the river -

WILL

(softly)

I'm sorry, Billie. I should have listened - it wasn't our war. All you
wanted was a baby...

He can't go on. He watches the tiny boat disappear around the knob of land.

IN THE RIVER

The current carries the boat past a jagged boulder. An ape's hand reaches
out and picks it up. He lifts it up to look more closely. We see his face -
it's Strider. He turns the toy over in his hand, looking at it quizzically.
He hands it to Diamond, wading along behind him -

Before he can answer, the Old Man and several others come down the beach -

It's decided - we're leaving the valley forever.

(turns to Strider)

Your people have won - the Seven Tribes of Middle Earth have been broken.
Long may their spirits haunt you

You and your mate can travel with u but we've got misery enough to carry.
Our hearth is not home to ny ape.

Then it's not home to us. The ape's better than any man I've known.

THREE SILHOUETTES

travel fast along a high ridge. The sun - a fiery disc - rises right behind
them. We recognize their physiques - Will in the lead, then Diamond and
Strider. As they cross the face of the sun, we dissolve to -

LIGHTS TWINKLE

on the buildings and terraces of the apes' city. Will and his two comrades
are on a bluff, looking down. The sound of music and laughter drifts
towards them on the night air. Suddenly a huge tongue of flame shoots out
of a stone chimney.

STRIDER

They've started up the furnace.

(softly)

Let the games begin.

DIAMOND

What games?

We see who's been coordinating the firing. It's Drak. Archers are kneeling
on the bridge, trying to sight a target through the foaming water and
clouds of mist.

Drak, never taking his eyes off of the river, draws back the massive spring
of his crossbow and reloads.

ON THE SHORE

Diamond ia hauling on the rope, pulling it in. Will, up to his neck in
water, tows himself along it. His feet find a footing - he starts to
scramble up the bank. Diamond goes towards him -

Just for a moment, the mist clears.

moment's long enough. Drak's seen him. In one fluid movement he adjusts his
aim and fires -

Diamond is almost in Will's arms. Sswhack! The arrow rips into WiU's back,
through his ribs. He pitches forward. Diamond screams. He falls into her
arms.

The mist closes around them.

HUGE STONE ARCH

The survivors of the Seven Tribes travel fast along a forest trail. All of
them are burdened down with possessions, weary from the road - they are
leaving the valley.

Kip's Wife and the Old Man are in the lead. They pass through the arch, out
into a clearing. In the middle of it is a fire, shadows camped around it -

Kip's wife and the other survivors stop in fear. One of the shadows rises
from the. fire. Bathed in moonlight - almost ghost-like - he comes towards
them. It's Aragorn!

Kip's wife moves forward and embraces him -

KIP'S WIFE

We thought you were dead.

ARAGORN

Hunted, but not dead. A dozen of us were driven back in the battle -

He indicates his men. They are coming forward, greeting the survivors. The
Young Woman sees her mate - she cries out. They hold each other.

All of the tribes-people are gathered around it.

OLD MAN

There is no-one else, Aragorn - you are the Ranger.

ARAGORN

(shaking his head)

No. We must all follow the trail we think best. You've decided yours. For
me * I'll go to the city of the apes and take what revenge I can. I'll go
alone - but like the traveler, I think death will be the only thing I find
there.

OLD MAN

Then it will find us, too. Warriors follow their Ranger. That's always been
the way of it in Middle Earth.

ARAGORN

But nothing's the same now. Think of the women-folk. What will become of
them?

KIP'S WIFE

You're right - there's so few of us now, nothing is the same. You must
allow the women to follow, too.

ARAGORN But women can't fight.

KIP'S WIFE Women have never been allowed to fight. That doesn't mean they
can't.

All the women nod their assent. The men smile, agreeing. Everyone waits for
Aragorn to decide. A beat - then he nods his head and smiles.

The tribes-people start to cheer. The Lookout steps forward. From out of
the folds of his fur, he takes the Crescent of Light. All of the tribe
stare at it.

LOOKOUT

I found it on the battlefield. There were those who said the Rangers had
left Middle Earth forever - I didn't know what to do with it.

He hands it to Aragorn. The whole tribe watches as the proud man once again
ties the talisman of his rank around his neck.

EXT. CEDARS-SINAI - WIDE - DAY

A monolith with alienating foregrounds. A bus pulls in on
Beverly. NEIL McCAULEY and a nurse get off. Neil carries
a paper bag and wears white pants like a hospital attendant.
Neil is an ice-cold professional: very big, very tough.
At 42 his short black hair is graying. He spent eight
years in McNeil and three in San Quentin. He got out and
hit the street in 1987. Four of the McNeil years were
spent in the hole. Neil's voice is street, but his language
is precise like an engineer's. He's very careful and very
good. Neil runs a professional crew that pulls down high
line, high number scores and does it anyway the score has
to be taken down: if on the prowl (a burglary), that's
fine; if they have to go in strong (armed), that's fine
too. And if you get in their way, that's got to be your
problem. His lifestyle is obsessively functional. There's
no steady woman or any encumbrance. Neil McCauley keeps
it so there's nothing he couldn't walk from in 30 seconds
flat.

While this exchange was going on, Anna has already climbed into Sandro's car. 
Sandro follows and takes his place at the wheel; Claudia gets in alongside 
him. The car takes off at high speed.
 


***
Heading south along a state highway, Sandro's car is traveling at high speed 
over a straight open road. It is twilight and as the evening shadows begin to 
fall, the surrounding countryside is bathed in an aura of mystery.

Inside the car Anna, Claudia and Sandro sit in complete silence. Anna is 
deeply absorbed in her own thoughts. Claudia is looking out of the window, 
enthralled by the dark beauty of the landscape. Another car draws up 
alongside of Sandro's and is about to pass him. But Sandro steps on the 
accelerator and pulls ahead with a tremendous burst of speed. The other car 
lags behind and then turns off at a crossroad. However, Sandro makes no 
attempt to slow down. In fact, spurred on by what has now become a definitely 
hostile atmosphere, he drives even faster.

As Sandro suddenly switches on the headlights, the violent glare that 
polarizes the roadside cuts off Claudia's view. She turns to Sandro with a 
look of disappointment

		It was lovelier before.
 
To please her, Sandro turns the headlights off and once again the countryside 
is covered by a veil of thick but romantic shadows.

Claudia remain there, watching the car disappear out of view. Now Sandro 
turns to look at Claudia, and smiles at her. Claudia is visibly upset. She 
doesn't smile back but merely turns away and heads towards Sandro's car.
 


***
Claudia is intent on looking at Sandro who is doing the driving. The car is 
traveling on a country road but Claudia shows no interest in the landscape. 
She continues to stare at Sandro as if she wants to know his most secret 
thoughts. Suddenly, feeling himself being stared at, Sandro turns towards 
Claudia. She quickly drops her gaze. Then Sandro turns his eyes back to the 
road, and Claudia looks up at him again.

From a bend in the road up ahead, preceded by the loud and penetrating blast 
of a horn, the bus mentioned earlier by the storekeeper appears. Sandro 
barely manages to stop the car in time off to one side of the road. He gets 
out and places himself in the middle of the road where he starts signaling 
for the bus to stop. With a loud screech of its brakes, the bus comes to a 
stop almost directly in front of him. The bus driver opens the window and 
leans out.
 
				DRIVER
		Did your car break down? 

				SANDRO 
		No. I only want some information.
 
Meanwhile, the driver's assistant gets down from the bus and the passengers 
lean out of the windows.  Claudia has also gotten out of the car and appears 
on the scene.

enters the lobby at that very moment.

Sandro doesn't answer but merely shrugs his shoulders. Then he takes Claudia

expression on his face and remains absolutely silent as he starts climbing 
the stairs. As they walk through the corridor, Claudia looks at him

           here, OK? When the Agency extracted
           your ass from Colombia fifteen
           years ago, and set you up here, we
           let you resume your business when

           you up for life. In exchange, you

           No. What I traveled all the way

      desk the only illumination. He looks ill, tense with
      waiting. Cigarette stubs piled in the ashtray.

      He listens to the solitary PHONE below him in the building.
      Then it is joined by a SECOND. Then a THIRD...

      Control listens, nerves stretched to their limit. From just
      outside - the sound of someone running up the wooden
      staircase. A knock.

          eat food at the deli counter. George and Ira sit across from
          each other.

          GEORGE
          In my travels, I have learned a lot
          about Asia and Buddhism. And I
          would like to be in the moment now
          with you, and to tell you how sorry
          I am, and how much I have
          appreciated your friendship. And
          even if we are not friends in the
          future, I wish you well on your
          journey.
          Ira laughs.

          IRA
          That guy was a douche-bag.

          GEORGE
          But also kind of cool. It's a very
          weird combination.

          IRA
          He was going to heal you with those
          herbs, man. You get sick again,
          you should call that guy.

          GEORGE
          I think most of what you said to me
          was true. And I really am sorry.
          I think I'm still not very
          healthy...in my brain.

JONS pats the smith on the back, quenches his thirst with beer, and sits down 
by his side. 

				PLOG 
		Are you married?
 
				JONS 
		I! A hundred times and more. I can't keep count

Suddenly, out of the silence and the dim light falling across the forest 
road, a ghostlike cart emerges. It is the WITCH being taken to the place 
where she will be burned. Next to her eight soldiers shuffle along tiredly, 
carrying their lances on their backs. The girl sits in the cart, bound with 
iron chains around her throat and arms. She stares fixedly into the 
moonlight.
 
A black figure sits next to her, a monk with his hood pulled down over his 
head.

The SOLDIER nods sourly. Hesitantly, the travelers follow. The KNIGHT guides 
his horse over to the side of the cart. The WITCH seems to be half-conscious, 
but her eyes are wide open.

				KNIGHT 
		I see that they have hurt your hands.

The WITCH'S pale, childish face turns towards the KNIGHT and she shakes her 
head.

		I have a potion that will stop your pain.

She shakes her head again.

TYAN nods quietly and looks away. Now they arrive at the parish border. At 
the foot of the nearby hills lies a crossroads. The pyre has already been 
stacked in the center of the forest clearing. The travelers remain there, 
hesitant and curious.
 
The soldiers have tied up the cart horse and bring out two long wooden beams.
They nail rungs across the beams so that it looks like a ladder. TYAN will be 
bound to this like an eelskin stretched out to dry.

The sound of the hammering echoes through the forest. The KNIGHT has 
dismounted and walks closer to the cart. Again he tries to catch TYAN'S eyes, 
touches her very lightly as if to waken her. Slowly she turns her face 
towards him.
 
				KNIGHT 
		They say that you have been in league with the

				TYAN
		Why do you ask?

		This cannot be.

		Look at her eyes, my lord. Her poor brain has

		That poor little child. I can't stand it, I 
		can't stand it ...

His voice sticks in his throat and he suddenly walks away. The KNIGHT mounts
his horse. The travelers depart from the crossroads. TYAN finally closes her 
eyes.
 


The forest is now very dark. The road winds between the trees. The wagon 
squeaks and rattles over stones and roots. A bird suddenly shrieks.
 
JOF lifts his head and wakes up. He has been asleep with his arms around 
MIA's shoulders. The KNIGHT is sharply silhouetted against the tree trunks.

His silence makes him seem almost unreal. JONS and PLOG are slightly drunk 
and support each other. Suddenly PLOG has to sit down. He puts his hands over 
his face and howls piteously. 

				PLOG 
		Oh, now it came over me again! 

				JONS 
		Don't scream. What came over you?

				PLOG 
		Hang on to something, my friends. The hour is 
		near! Who is that at the edge of the forest if 
		not my own dearly beloved, with actor attached?

The two lovers discover PLOG and it's too late. They cannot retreat. SKAT 
immediately takes to his heels. PLOG chases him, swinging his sledge and 
bellowing like a wild boar.

For a few confusing moments the two rivals stumble among the stones and 
bushes in the gray gloom of the forest. The duel begins to look senseless, 
because both of them are equally frightened.

The travelers silently observe this confused performance. LISA screams once 
in a while, more out of duty than out of impulse.

				SKAT 
			(panting) 
		You miserable stubbleheaded bastard of seven 
		scurvy bitches, if I were in your lousy rags I 
		would be stricken with such eternal shame about 
		my breath, my voice, my arms and legs -- in 
		short, about my whole body -- that I would 
		immediately rid nature of my own embarrassing 
		self.

			(angry) 
		Watch out, you perfumed slob, that I don't fart 
		on you and immediately blow you down to the 
		actor's own red-hot hell, where you can sit and 
		recite monologues to each other until the dust 
		comes out of the Devil's ears. 

Then LISA throws herself around her husband's neck. 

				LISA 
		Forgive me, dear little husband, I'll never do 
		it again. I am so sorry and you can't imagine 
		how terribly that man over there betrayed me.

SKAT looks at the travelers with a pained expression and then lifts his eyes 
towards the night sky. 

				SKAT

Night and then dawn.

The travelers have come to a sort of clearing and have collapsed on the moss.
They lie quietly and listen to their own breathing, their heartbeats, and the

          Glycerin is, of course, the best-known
          nitrating agent. Now keep in mind,
          nitroglycerin is extremely unstable. A
          slight tap, a one degree change in
          temperature and it'll blow up in your
          hands. Yee-haa, let's mix us up a batch!

Instructor #1 holds up a beaker.

Let's get it on!

STEVEN
Are you any good?

CABLE GUY
Feed me under the boards and you'll find
out.

Play begins. The shirts inbound to Jeff. The Cable Guy is all over him, covering him as tightly as 
humanly possible. He keeps his hands near Jeff's face, whacks him in the back as he dribbles, etc. 
He couldn't be more annoying. Jeff passes to Rick who drives to the basket and puts up a shot 
which goes in. Rick and Jeff slap hands.

CABLE GUY
(doing the traveling hand signal)
Traveling! That's traveling!

RICK
Yeah, whatever you say Chip.

Everyone runs down the court, ignoring him.

CABLE GUY
All right, so we're playing that type of
game. Prison rules. I get it.

Steven takes the ball out. The cable Guy runs around the court, attempting to get open. He criss 
crosses all over the court.

CABLE GUY
Feed me the rock! Feed me the rock! I'm
open!

Steven passes to the Cable Guy, who drives to the basket, pushing Jeff out of the way in the 
process. The ball goes in.

CABLE GUY
(does the foul hand signal)
And one! That's definitely a foul!

You want to mug me, my wallet is in my

     Inside the church. Plain and functional. Poor but
     faithful. A trio -- electric guitar, accordion,
     tambourine -- playing a hymn. Forty-five voices raised
     in song. The tempo is ragged and the pitch shaky, but
     the feeling is strong. They mean it.

                         THE RIDER
          appears to be a tenderfoot, due to his style of dress. A long grey

               Everybody knows Freddie Miles.

                   (unsettled)
               Is Freddie in Rome?

                         MEREDITH
               Now? I don't think so. But I've met him,
               of course, and we've chatted and I know
               about you and Marge and Mongi and what an
               unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you
               were a rat and I thought to myself now I
               know why he travels under R.

                         RIPLEY
               I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So
               the rat's here now, in Rome.

                         MEREDITH
               Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if -

                         RIPLEY
               Don't be sorry. I've never been happier.
               I feel like I've been handed a new life.

               Yes, what happened? I heard you were

     Ripley and Peter walk through the square, the pigeons
     scattering. Ripley breathes in the atmosphere, the beautiful
     grey.

                         RIPLEY
               Peter, I'm really sorry to put you
               through this. I just couldn't face going
               to the police by myself when my Italian's
               so rotten.

                         PETER
               Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted
               you finally made it to Venice. I'm
               delighted, contrary to rumour, you're
               still in one piece?

                         RIPLEY
               What rumour?

                         PETER
               That Dickie murdered you and is
               travelling under your passport. I know,
               ridiculous.

     INT. POLICE STATION, VENICE. LATE DAY.

     Later.  Ripley sits in the middle of a bustling Police Station,
     where thefts, tourists, thieves and complaints are being
     processed.  The Station is in an old brewery or armory. It's a
     horrible, monochrome, oppressive place. Peter is in
     conversation at a desk, turns and walks over to where Ripley
     waits.

                         PETER
               Welcome to Venice.  This place reeks,
               doesn't it? Can you smell it?  Ugh.
               Sorry. Not the best way to spend your
               first day.

                         RIPLEY
               It's okay.

                         PETER
               Anyway I've got to the bottom of the

     A week later and Peter and Ripley are on the deck of the
     ferry, the HELLENES, as it sails towards Greece.  They're
     laughing.

                         RIPLEY
               Ask me what I want to change about this
               moment.

               Hello.  What are you up to?

          Daybreak. Sunlight streams in, soft suffusion, the color of
          good scotch. PRIMO SPARAZZA, 86, lies on a hospital bed, an
          O2 mask shrouding deep-set, sunken eyes, cataract-grey, gazing
          out at a four-walled world. Someone enters the room, awaiting
          approval to approach...Sparazza, turning, seeing the man,
          summoning him over with a feeble finger wag. The man reaches
          him, kneeling down, ring-kissing reverent, whispering:
          
                                MAN
                    ...he's here now...

          again...and another MAN enters, walking slowly toward
          Sparazza's bedside. He sets down his luggage, a black leather
          valise. The travel tags originate in Stockholm:

          --till gravity grabs, pulls-- plummeting him toward earth,

     INT.  KITCHEN  DUSK

     Lhamo is playing a game with pebbles on the raised, wooden
     platform in the kitchen.  The fire is lit.  He is alone.

     The dog begins to bark.

                            We are traveling to Lhasa.  May

                            Of course, please, this way.
                            Your servant may use the kitchen.

                            Thank you.

     A middle-aged man, the SERVANT, wearing heavy, ragged
     clothes and wrapped boots, enters the kitchen.

     Lhamo slides over so that the man can sit on the platform
     beside him.  The man picks up a few pebbles and drops them -
     he knows the game.

     We recognize this servant.  His name is KEUSTANG RINPOCHE.
     He is one of the monks we saw at the Oracle lake, the one
     with the mesmerizing eyes.  Keustang Rinpoche is the Lama of
     Sera Monastery.

     Lhamo sees a dark brown rosary around the Servant's neck and
     immediately pulls at the string of beads.

     The Servant takes the rosary off and gives it to the boy.
     Lhamo hangs the string of beads around his own neck.  The
     Servant makes a move to take back the rosary, but Lhamo
     resists.

                            Lhamo, no.

     Lhamo goes back to his game.  The Mother hands the tired man
     a slice of bread and a steaming cup of tea.  The man's
     hands are shaking.  He cannot look the woman in the eye.

`NUMBER OF CONFIRMED GLOBAL LANDING SITES GROWS TO 128'

A post-it note sticks to the clipping that reads:

LANDED 10-18-2018

WE PASS BY more clippings, catching glimpses of dramatic
headlines and surreal images:

`PRESIDENT CALLS FOR EMERGENCY EVAC IN ALL MAJOR CITIES'

`CHURCHES, MOSQUES, TEMPLES FLOODED WITH PEOPLE'

WE PASS BY a grainy newspaper photo of a military stand
off... With ONE creature. The headline reads:

`MILITARY EXPERTS AGREE: "INDESTRUCTIBLE"

...AGAIN WE HEAR THAT FAMILIAR SOUND as it gets louder.

WE CONTINUE TO TRAVEL as... A MAP enters frame. Like one you
would get at a gas station, it is covered in illustrated
forests and rivers... it is a map of THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
The portion above Manhattan... is covered in hand drawn red
circles and pins, each accompanied with a date and names...
of the dead.

WE MOVE FURTHER ALONG to reveal... low quality stills of
security footage barely showing... THE CREATURE. Each still
is drawn on and analyzed. Then... a large white board
covered in writing comes into frame, leaning against the
wall. Amidst the scratches of written and rewritten thoughts,
we can make out two lists labeled, `QUESTIONS' and
`CONFIRMED'

In the `QUESTIONS' column are listed; "NO DEMANDS?", "NO SIGN
OF ORGANIZATION", "BLIND?" "HOW MANY?"... "SOUND... WHY NOT
ATTACK ALL SOUND?"

In the `CONFIRMED' column are phrases like; "4-6 CONFIRMED IN
PACK"..., "DO NOT ATTACK SMALL SOUNDS". Then we see the phrase
"DO NOT EAT KILL".

WE MOVE TO the very bottom of the white board where we see
the word... "WEAPON???"...

Listed below words are crossed out... "EXPLOSIVES"...

     WE FOLLOW REGAN and MARCUS as they sprint up the main sand
     path/driveway running parallel to the cornfields. With the
     flashlight slicing through the darkness... it's nearly
     impossible to tell where we are. Suddenly the corn ends and
     OVER MARCUS AND REGAN we see...

     Shadows of farm equipment!

     passed. Then...

     WE TRAVEL DOWN from the dirt ceiling... past a hook on the
     wooden support beam... to a clear plastic IV BAG hanging...
     down a fluid filled plastic tube... and into an arm.

     WE PULL BACK to reveal EVELYN lying on the hay bale
     comfortably... her eyes still closed. She has been
     bandaged... and wears LEE's sweater. A single burning candle
     by her side. Then...

     EVELYN SHOOTS AWAKE!!! SHE SCRAMBLES TO SIT UP THROUGH THE
     PAIN!!! HER EYES SEARCH A LOW LIT ROOM!!! SHE GOES TO SIT

     Out of the darkness... comes LEE!   He is holding the baby.

               It's ok.   It's ok!   Your safe.

From one corner of the large opening... a stream of water
pours down into the room. Suddenly...

A SNORT!!!!

EVELYN's head slowly turns... The look on her face reveals to
us the immediate truth that her brain won't yet admit.

EVELYN's POV as we scan the room once more.   This time, in
the shadowed corner of the room...

A LARGE BLACK SHAPE!!!!!

EVELYN is frozen with fear as she watches....

THE SILHOUETTE OF A CREATURE STANDING DIRECTLY ABOVE HER
BABY'S CRIB!!!!!!!!!!

WE HOLD ON EVELYN, her brain racing as fast as her heart, as
she slowly looks at THE PLATES ROTATING... SCANNING THE ROOM.
Suddenly... Her breath stops... as EVELYN...

STANDS UP!!!!!

As she stands... We watch the rings in the water from EVELYN
flow through the room... TO THE CREATURE!! The plates
immediately turn down toward the rings in the water.

EVELYN looks over to the water running down the steps... then
back to the creature. It is clear it can't place exactly
where she is due to the sound of the dripping water.

WE FOLLOW on EVELYN'S back as she begins to slowly... MOVE
THROUGH THE WATER!!!

Suddenly... the red lights from the barn above begin to
DIM... and illuminate THE CREATURES BACK!!!

vibrating... WE TRAVEL CLOSE up it's back through the tunnel

          in the morning.

          Heard you get up off the couch half an
          hour ago, and had a funny feeling you
          might not be here for our breakfast.

Chris says nothing.

                       RON (CONT'D)
          I'm going to drive you a hundred miles to
          somewhere where you can pick up a train,
          a plane, or hitch a ride without getting
          stuck on this desert. I'd take you all
          the way to Alaska if I didn't have to get
          to an eight o'clock mass.

           They arrive to the FORD PLANTATION. The main house of
           the plantation - the GREAT HOUSE as they are commonly
           called - is sizable. Two stories high with a piazza in
           front. In the rear are also a log kitchen, poultry
           house, corncribs and several slave cabins. The
           plantation is described as "a green spot in the
           wilderness."
           With the arrival of Master Ford there is a flurry of
           activity - the "excitement" of a new delivery. MR.

           We are in a wooded area. There is A GANG OF SLAVES
           chopping trees into timber. It is hard, laborious work
           made no more easy by the sweltering heat. Solomon is
           among them as well as Sam.

           employed in piling the timber and chopping it into
           lumber. As before, there is little doubt about the
           rigors of the job at hand.
           Working as a carpenter at the work area is JOHN TIBEATS.
           There are also various CUSTOMERS who move about placing

           I became a little too dependant on

           undependable on the job. Before
           you say I'm just a sorry drunkard,
           let me state my case: As reliable
           employment as overseeing is, it's
           no easy chore on the spirit. I
           say no man of conscious can take
           the lash to another human day in,
           and day out without shredding at
           his own self. Takes him to a
           place where he either makes
           excuses within his mind to be
           unaffected... Or finds some way

           mostly by emotion alone. Though at first Epps does
           little more than joke his way around the facts.
           Solomon, working still, can't help but overhear as Epps
           offers Bass a drink, which Bass waves away.

           is.

           How's this? Tell me all about it.

           Master Epps if I should.

           to a lot of people. What you have
           just said to me scares me, and I
           must say, sir, I am afraid. Not

Evening leagues are going strong. John walks in, looks
totally out of place. He moves down the BALL RACK area,
runs his fingers across the various leftovers, finally
stops at a pearl-white dazzler.
He lifts it from the rack, steps out into the prep
area -- in front of one of the few lanes not in use.
Number 13.
John snatches a grease pencil from the overhead,
scribbles right on the ball -- "PROVISIONS DEPLETED."
He fluffs his trench coat back, steps onto the polished
wood with his well-traveled Oxfords.
Young bowlers on both sides stop to look at this oddity.
An attractive brunette is rather curious. John gives her
a wink. Her boyfriend doesn't appreciate it.
John bowls. Perfect hook ball. Strike! Brunette grins.

           wormhole. A gateway to a distant
           corner of the universe. The black
           hole is on the far side.
                         
          On-screen, the black hole system is removed to a distant
          corner, connected to ours by a tunnel through space-time. A
          gravity wave from the collision travels through the tunnel.
                         
                          NSA AGENT
           I've read your book, Doctor. You
           said that wormholes are impossible.
                         
                          ANSEN
           There is nothing quite as satisfying
           as being proved utterly wrong.
                          (SMILES)
           I said that a wormhole couldn't exist
           naturally. Not for more than a few
           billionths of a second. It would
           have to be... stabilized.

          Case continues. Doyle leans over to Cooper, conspiratorially.

                          (LOW)
           Don't worry about Roth. He's nuts.
           But Case says that means he's ideally
           suited for space travel.
                         
          Case repositions the map near a much smaller black hole that
          is orbiting Gargantua.
                         
                          CASE
           We're headed for this smaller black
           hole. Roth calls it Pantagruel. We
           think the ice planet is here-

           We exit the wormhole here. And we
           slingshot around Pantagruel to reach
           the ice planet. This is the period
           in which we'll lose time.

           You listened to all of those messages

The far side of the shelter has a one-sheet for Crime Lab.
("This fall, Mondays are murder.") The bench side is a promo
poster for a show called Knowing. ("Some fates are chosen

It's here we find Gary taking a seat, gingerly checking his
toes where the rat trap snapped. He's hobbled his way here
from the house, which is probably a block away.

There's only a little blood, but his toes really hurt.

Over Gary's shoulder, we see a blonde 8-year old girl
(Noelle) watching him with concern. She BANGS on the shelter
to get his attention. Gary nearly jumps out of his skin.

      Pulling out Mary's cell phone, Gabriel tries to get a signal.
      By his reaction, it's still iffy.

      He dials, but the call drops.    Tries again.   Just the same.

      He looks left.   Looks right.    Looks back down the dirt road.

      He decides to head off to the right, downhill.

INT. WOMAN'S EYE

The same scene reflected across the surface of a woman's
brown eye, intense with emotion, curiosity. Gradually, the
WEATHER SOUNDS are overtaken by VOICES coming up. At first
the SOCIAL CHATTER is PERIPHERAL, then the VOICES grow more
STRIDENT, OPPRESSIVE. The eye blinks.


INT. GALLERY, COPENHAGEN, DENMARK, EVENING

A painting of the same sea, captured with remarkable accuracy
of feeling. A HUBBUB OF GABBLING VOICES. Too many people in
a low-ceilinged room. One voice dominates now -

                     OLDER WOMAN (O.S.)

The woman smiles and heads into the crowd, leaving Gerda to
consider... Gerda's gaze travels across the well-dressed
gathering. Far off in a corner, there's an inner circle
where her handsome husband EINAR WEGENER is being showered
with praise. A portly goateed man dominates the scene -

                    good man, he wanted to help people.
                    So he would stand by a river that
                    had no bridge and carry people
                    across. He was a big strong man and

                    the river and asked to be carried
                    across. Christopher tried to carry
                    him but he was too heavy. He was
                    just a small boy but he was heavier
                    than any man he had ever carried.
                    The boy explained that he was the
                    son of God, and that he was so
                    heavy because he bore all the sins
                    of the world. After that,
                    Christopher was able to carry him
                    across and when they got to the
                    other side the boy baptized him in
                    the river. And that's how he became

No answer from Holmes. We now see -- but Watson does not
-- that the chair is occupied by a section of Holmes'
smoking machine, with the pipe attached.

Still no answer -- just a little pipe smoke drifting up

glasses, tosses them toward the chair. There is a loud
thud, the pipe falls to the floor, then there is silence.

wheezing slightly. Watson picks it up, and his   eyes

           JACOBS slaps down a copy of the Evening Standard on the
           desk. The front page carries a picture of Tibbs Farm with
           the caption: "Exclusive - Marilyn's Luxury Home In
           England". He jabs a finger at it angrily.

           Yes we can. I knew Cotes-Preedy
           wouldn't be able to keep this

           When you asked me to find a house

           precaution of finding two. The
           other one, Parkside, is much
           better and the owner is very
           discreet.

           An actress has to be pretty tough

           He glances up at COLIN in the mirror, shrewd and

           But be careful, boy. She doesn't

           Gossip is always fast to travel but on a film it goes at

           greeted with wolf whistles and jeers by RICHARD WATTIS,
           PAUL HARDWICK and the crew.

                          SOUNDMAN
           What was Marilyn like then, Col?

                          HARDWICK

           Will she be in today or is she
           too tired?
           It is all good-natured stuff but COLIN feels strangely
           protective, not so much on his own behalf as Marilyn's.

                          COLIN
           She was just being friendly.

               crying silently.  Sonny holds out the plastic bag for the 
               checks for her.  She drops it.

               starts to burn the pages of the register, tearing out pages

               Ted pushes his room-service cart. He is flushed. Puffed up. 
               Lights a cigarette, takes a great big, satisfied drag. Eva 
               runs to the door dreamily, her naked body wrapped in her 
               shawl. She passes him a card.

                                     EVA

                         call.

               She smiles and shuts the door. The other witches are arriving 
               with supplies from the garden. Kiva, now having raised her 
               blood sugar, sucks on a lollipop, a sunny girl. She talks to 
               Raven, who carries a birch limb.

                                     KIVA

                         It's a birch branch, symbolizing 
                         eternal life. You can also use the 
                         bark for a tea which assists in astral 
                         travel.

               The other girls roll their eyes as Elspeth smiles proudly. 
               Ted blows smoke at them and pushes his cart off down the 
               hall. The witches run inside the room.

               IN THE SUITE

               Eva sits, blissed-out, in the center of the circle, smiles.

                 on. Sit. Mouth closed, eyes
                 shut. No pouting. No peeking.

    Sara flops down on the sofa beside her. Closes her eyes.
    Glynn removes the clover chain from her neck, fastens it
    around Sara's.

                               GLYNN
                 For luck tomorrow. Not that
                 you'll need it. You dance like an
                 angel.

    The necklace is Glynn's talisman. Sara knows what it
    means to her. She throws her arms around Glynn, holds
    onto her tightly.

                               SARA
                 I love the necklace but you're
                 still the best luck I'll ever
                 have.

    Glynn, not one to choke up, chokes up.        They cling to
    each other.


8   INT. AMTRAK TRAIN (MOVING) - ON SARA - DUSK (PRESENT)          8

    In the blink of her eyes, the memory fades. She pulls
    the window shade, shifts in her seat. Her fingers travel
    to the clover necklace at her throat. Linger. The Woman
    regards her.

                               WOMAN
                 Nice... the necklace.

A hundred and one next month.

                                  BODINE

Okay, so she's a very old goddamned liar. I traced her as far back as the
20's... she was working as an actress in L.A. An actress. Her name was Rose
Dawson. Then she married a guy named Calvert, moved to Cedar Rapids, had
two kids. Now Calvert's dead, and from what I've heard Cedar Rapids is
dead.

The Sea Stallion approaches the ship, BG, forcing Brock to yell over the
rotors.

                                  LOVETT

And everyobody who knows about the diamond is supposed to be dead... or on
this ship. But she knows about it. And I want to hear what she has to say.
Got it?

                                                                   CUT TO:

22 EXT. KELDYSH HELIPAD

IN A THUNDERING DOWNBLAST the helicopter's wheels bounce down on the
helipad.

Lovett, Buell and Bodine watch as the HELICOPTER CREW CHIEF hands out about
ten suitcases, and then Rose is lowered to the deck in a wheelchair by
Keldysh crewmen. Lizzy, ducking unnecessarily under the rotor, follows her
out, carrying FREDDY the Pomeranian. The crew chief hands a puzzled Keldysh
crewmember a goldfish bowl with several fish in it. Rose does not travel
light.

HOLD ON the incongruous image of this little old lady, looking impossibly
fragile amongst all the high tech gear, grungy deck crew and gigantic
equipment.

                                  BODINE

S'cuse me, I have to go check our supply of Depends.

Lizzy is unpacking Rose's things in the small utilitarian room. Rose is
placing a number of FRAMED PHOTOS on the bureau, arranging them carefully
next to the fishbowl. Brock and Bodine are in the doorway.

Is your stateroom alright?

Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me.

                                   LIZZY

Yes. We met just a few minutes ago, grandma. Remember, up on deck?

                                   ROSE

Oh, yes.

Brock glances at Bodine... oh oh. Bodine rolls his eyes. Rose finishes
arranging her photographs. We get a general glimpse of them: the usual
snapshots... children and grandchildren, her late husband.

                                   ROSE

There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of
course.

                            (to the Pomeranian)

Isn't that right, sweetie.

Would you like anything?

                                   ROSE

I should like to see my drawing.

                                                                   CUT TO:

24 INT. LAB DECK, PRESERVATION AREA

Rose looks at the drawing in its tray of water, confronting herself across
a span of 84 years. Until they can figure out the best way to preserve it,
they have to keep it immersed. It sways and ripples, almost as if alive.

TIGHT ON Rose's ancient eyes, gazing at the drawing.

25 FLASHCUT of a man's hand, holding a conte crayon deftly creating a
shoulder and the shape of her hair with two efficient lines.

26 THE WOMAN'S FACE IN THE DRAWING, dancing under the water.

27 A FLASHCUT of a man's eyes, just visible over the top of a sketching
pad. They look up suddenly right into the LENS. Soft eyes, but fearlessly
direct.

28 Rose smiles, remembering. Brock has the reference photo of the necklace
in his hand.

Well... it's a big world, and I want to see it all before I go. My father
was always talkin' about goin' to see the ocean. He died in the town he was
born in, and never did see it. You can't wait around, because you never
know what hand you're going to get dealt next. See, my folks died in a fire
when I was fifteen, and I've been on the road since. Somethin' like that
teaches you to take life as it comes at you. To make each day count.

Rose notices that Thomas Andrews, sitting next to her, is writing in his
notebook, completely ignoring the conversation.

                                   ROSE

Mr. Andrews, what are you doing? I see you everywhere writing in this
little book.

          its sheet of paper on which instructions are typed.
          Jonathan peers at the laptop clock. It reads                            10:58   PM.
          His eyes travel in a tense triangle from instructions, to
          laptop screen, to glass wall - fingers typing all the while.
          He finally reaches a prompt: BIENVENUE. POUR ANGLAIS, CBOISEZ P2.

          glimpse an 8 digit code circled in pencil. Jonathan stares at
          the cursor.on the laptop screen, the icon blinking
          petulantly. He's about to type...
          And then he halts. His eyes drifting to HIS CELL PHONE,

and heads for a cluster of buildings. Behind the
buildings, a cemetery.

                                                        3.

EXT. CLUSTER OF BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The truck pulls up in front of the old parsonage -- it's a
different color than he remembers.

             He couldn't find his own butt with
             both hands at high noon in a hall
             of mirrors.

Sniggering laughter.

                           CLAY

Landon presses the gas.    The CAR ROARS away.

             bonehead.

Clay smiles, good-natured.    He often misses social cues.


EXT. CAMARO - TRAVELING

Landon drops Clay's student monitor vest out onto the
road. Another car runs it over.


EXT. ROAD

Mr. Kelly walks over, picks up the vest. Shakes it.
Frustrated. Eyes the empty beer bottles by the dumpster.

Camaro is parked on the dirt access road, headlights
shining through the locked rear gate. JOHN COUGAR
MELLENCAMP's "Small Town" playing.

Landon, Clay, and Belinda sit drinking, smoking weed.
Under the MUSIC, a CB RADIO scanner CHATS quietly.

He picks up the envelope with wet hands. Without looking
inside, rips it in half. Cynthia smiles, quietly happy.


INT. SCHOOL BUS - TRAVELING - SATURDAY MORNING

Enthusiastic preppies, richies, other do-gooders, singing
"Karma Chameleon." Jamie sits in an aisle seat, reading,
not singing. She turns around to look at Landon.    He
rides in the back row, staring out the window, wearing a
Sony Walkman, glum.


HIS POV

To Z.Z. TOP'S "Sleeping Bag." Out the window -- Jefferson
High School coming into view. Bars on every window,
chain-link fence around the parameter, no grass.

                                                          21.

INT. JEFFERSON HIGH - LIBRARY - LITTLE LATER

             Swing! Keep your bat parallel to
             the ground. Follow through.
             Follow through!

Jamie is laughing too hard to hit anything. The balls
keep coming. She ducks out of the way and grasps the
fence and leans in. Landon leans in on his side. They'd
be embracing if the fence weren't there.

In the b.g., kids from their school.    Giggling,
whispering.

Landon looks over at them.

INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - EVENING (MID-FEBRUARY)

A small group of students sit on stage reading from Our
Town, rehearsing. Jamie and Landon sit together in the
third row, holding hands. Landon glances at her, realizes
she's asleep. Pulls her sweater over her.


INT. JEFFERSON HIGH - LIBRARY - SATURDAY MORNING

Landon sits with Luis; Jamie at the next table with
Isabel. She looks pale. He catches her eye. They both
smile, a little sadly, then turn back to their students.

                                                           97.

            They're going to build a tunnel
            under the English Channel.
            They're calling it The Chunnel.

No response.

             Whatever you need. Whatever Jamie
             needs. I'm here.

             I could start by driving her to
             school --

                           JAMIE
             I'm not going back to school.

Landon and her father both turn to her.      Pale, wane.   They
understand what she is saying.

                           JAMIE
             You can tell anyone you want.   I
             don't care.

She goes into the house. Landon and Reverend Sullivan
look at each other, then away, uncomfortable. That didn't
sound like her.


INT. BEAUFORT HIGH - HALLWAY - MONDAY MORNING

Landon, looking haggard, moves slowly as he cleans out
Jamie's locker.

Students stare as he carefully places her things,
including the pink sweater, in a shopping bag. They part
and hush as he passes by. News travels fast. Clay and
Eric step forward.

               In a chair near the window, Truman sits awake in his pajamas, 
               unable to sleep, completely unable to decide what to do. He 
               watches Jack sleep. A long time -- then Truman walks to the 
               closet, gets out a travel bag, starts to pack.

               The office is in a largely abandoned mini-mall. It's going 
               to be a clear summer day. David hurries through the empty 
               parking lot to Volvo station wagon.

               As the car exits the lot, we see the Austin skyline with the 
               capitol building in the distance.

               David stops at a red light beside a squad car with one cop 
               inside. The cop gives him a cursory glance.

               INT. DAVID'S CAR - SUNRISE

               He stares at the cop. The cop looks neutrally ahead; behind 
               him the buckle of his seat belt shoulder strap catches the 
               reflection of the rising sun.

               BACK TO DAVID

               He stares, then:

          Elizabeth smiles, surprised and delighted. And grateful

          She moves away, to speak to her uncle. Miss Bingley moves

          In six months I have never seen anyone so

                         DARCY
          I perceive no alteration' except she is
          rather tanned. Hardly a miraculous
          consequence of travelling in the summer.

                         MISS BINGLEY
          I remember, when we first knew her in

          Darcy is driving Elizabeth and the Gardiner's back to

          Darcy who holds the reins, while Mr and Mrs Gardiner sit
          comfortably in the carriage. Mr Gardiner smiles broadly
          at two large fish that lie beside him.

The hell.

And he THROWS HIMSELF on Amsterdam. It's more like he rolls over onto him
than anything, but he's on top of him now, hitting him in the face with
all he's got left in him.

AMSTERDAM
Goddamn it.

Amsterdam HEAVES Johnny off and pops him a solid SWIPE to the jaw. That
does it. Lights out. Johnny falls unconscious into the slime beneath the
pier.

The Orphan Pack keeps staring from the shadow with their ferret eyes.
Still silent. Amsterdam STRUGGLES to his feet, stops at the river's edge
to get a handful of water to revive himself. Then he looks over, sees his
unconscious friend.

AMSTERDAM
Goddamn you anyway.

He grabs Johnny's body by the shoulders and pulls him to the river's edge.
He gets some water on his hand, lets it drip over Johnny's face, washing
away a little of the blood. Not enough. He draws some more water, and RUBS
it gently onto Johnny's face.

CLOSE: on the motion of his hand. It is nearly gentle.

          You never saw anything like it. You
          could hardly take it all in without
          fearing you might go blind from the
          shine. From one kind of world too
          hard to bear came some kind a
          heaven no one knew existed.
          End on Jacob seeing: Marlena gloriously atop her horses who
          form a tableau, as a curtain of sparks falls behind them.

      Linen tablecloths. Fine china. Frank is one of the only

      Frank takes out a bottle of pills from his pocket, then
      another and another...
      
      He takes one or two pills from each and swallows them
      methodically. She watches him.

      Where all the trouble really started. Matthew, the stalled
      Harvester, with the crashed Rover still trapped beneath it.
      The crash site is beginning to resemble some old underwater
      shipwreck.

      The Rover enters the frame, beginning to slow down as it
      approaches the crash site. Sam 2 rolls the Rover to a
      standstill about ten feet from the front of the Harvester.

Kit, rifle in hand, lumbers out a side door of the house with 
Cato over his shoulder. He steers for a nearby box car that 
evidently served Cato as a shed. 

HOLLY (v.o.)
Kit was the most trigger happy person I'd ever met. He claimed 
that as long as you're playing for keeps and the law is coming at 
you, it's considered okay to shoot all witnesses. You had to take 
the consequences, though, and not whine about it later.

Kit opens the doors of the box car. and dumps Cato inside. Before 
closing the doors he checks Cato's shoes. to see if they are the 
ones he gave him. Holly looks on from the side of the house, 
twenty yards away.

We're in for it now... If they catch us.

Kit looks cornered and defensive. Holly thinks for a moment.

What'd you put him in there for?

KIT (shrugging)
Just to keep him out of the sun.

Kit heads out of sight around the rear of the box car. Holly goes 
back inside. Kit walks up and down the length of the box car, 
talking under his breath and throwing his rifle from hand to 
hand, in a state.

The lights are full on now. Lizzy sits on the bed clutching a blanket around
herself.

Tommy hops around in his underwear, searching desperately.

All the videos are opened and scattered everywhere.

     Exactly. I'm not wanting a cat, she says. Get to fuck, right. So
     there's Tommy stuck with this kitten. You can imagine what
     happened. The thing was neglected, pissing and shitting all over
     the place. Tommy was lying around fucked out of his eyeballs on
     smack or downers. He didn't know you could get toxoplasmosis from
     cat shit.

                                   RENTON

     I didn't either. What the fuck is it?

     He starts getting headaches, so he just uses more smack, for the
     pain, like. There he has a stroke. A fucking stroke. Just like
     that. God home from hospital and died about three weeks later.
     Been dead for ages before the neighbours complained about the
     smell and the police broke the door down. Tommy was lying face
     down in a pool of vomit.

The lower half of Tommy's clothed body is visible.

     Every time I think of Tommy I think of Australian, because every
     time I went round he was just lying there, junked out of his mind,
     watching Aussie soaps. Until he sold the telly, of course, then he
     was just lying there. Buy every time I think of him, I still think
     of Australia.

     unreliable fuck-ups in town. I knew what was going on in his mind:
     any trouble in London and he would dump us immediately, one way or
     another. He had to. If he got caught with a bagful of skag, on top
     of that armed robbery shit, he was going down for fifteen to
     twenty. Begbie was hard, but not so hard that he didn't shite it
     off twenty years in Saughton.

A shot of Willcox Hillyer at a Hertz Counter in the Atlanta
airport. A tense, wrought up Dave Wilkie is in the b.g. of
the shot. During the following brief exchange, Hillyer is
politely cool, Wilkie under a great strain.

			DAVE WILKIE 
		(holds out hand)
	Well, got to get a plane to
	Savannah. Great running into you,
	Buddy. Give my best to your Daddy.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
	Yeah, I'll do that, Dave.

			DAVE WILKIE 
		(sweating, tense, under
		 some kind of awful
		 emotional strain)
	Ah-h, if you happen to run into
	Rose sometime... do me a favor,
	give her a message for me, will
	you?

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(a trifle wearily)
	Dave, I haven't seen Rose for
	years.

Hillyer takes rental car papers from a pretty young HERTZ
GIRL, gives the girl a little smile, picks up his travel bag.
In desperation, Dave takes his arm.

			DAVE WILKIE 
	Buddy, I'm a sick man. I had a
	heart attack last year, I wasn't
	expected to live.

Hillyer turns to Dave, puzzled and interested; Dave earnestly
explains.

			DAVE WILKIE (CONT'D)
	You might see her. She writes your
	Daddy, and she and that doctor came
	to see him, didn't they? I wish
	you'd tell her something... I never
	could write letters.

			WILLCOX HILLYER 
		(in a different tone,
		 interested, curious)
	What do you want me to tell her,
	Dave?

			DAVE WILKIE 
		(a painful inward
		 struggle; the man is
		 tormented, miserable)
	Oh, to hell with it, never mind.
	Don't tell her anything. Don't even
	tell her you saw me. 
		(half turns his back, his
		 face twisted with strong
		 emotion)
	Got to run, Buddy, I'll miss my
	plane.

Willcox Hillyer and the pretty young Hertz Girl stare after
Dave Wilkie as he walks away with spasm-like steps. Hillyer
seems affected, less hostile toward Dave now. He speaks half
to himself, half to the Hertz Girl.

           WALTER (ON TV)
           My psyche was scarred in my art
           student days. Nothing in my life has
           ever made such an impact as the sight
           of the children: War-wracked
           innocents, without homes, without
           parents, fighting over garbage...
          He sits in a half-circle of PROPER WOMEN, who are spellbound.

           WALTER (ON TV)
           Goaded by a frantic despair, I
           sketched these dirty, ragged little
           victims... with their bruised minds
           and bodies, their matted hair and
           runny noses. There my life as a
           painter began in earnest.

          reacts coyly, as if he's surprised.

      A bruised Ted enters, once again the only person in the shop.  He keeps his
      parka on.  Avis stands to greet him.

                                  AVIS
              Hello.  Can I help you?

                                  PAUL (O.S.)
                        (icily)
              Mr. Watters?

      Paul comes around the corner.  He extends his hand, shocked to see the
      bruises on Ted's face but knowing exactly where they came from.

                                  TED
              Mr. Barnell.  I have your check.

                                  PAUL
              Thank you, I appreciate that.
                        (an awkward pause)
              Please, sit.

      Ted sits at Paul desk, reaches into his brief case and pulls out an envelope
      and several forms.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              Have a little accident, there?

      An overwrought Paul is on the phone with Tiffany, sitting in the dark.  He's got
      his home phone bill in front of him.

                                  PAUL
              I have a situation.  My wife...  do you think it's okay to
              do something kinda bad to someone if you think
              they're gonna do something really bad to someone
              else?

              What if it's a really bad thing?

                                  TIFFANY
              Well, you probably shouldn't break the law if you can
              help it.  Are you really sure they're going to do this
              other thing?

      As Ray stands to go, Paul nods, his heart ripped apart for any number of
      reasons.

      on the desk.

      Paul, with his sack of one million dollars at his feet, is calmly trying on new
      winter coats with a CLERK.  He feels each one, checking the amount of
      padding.  He finally settles on a red full-length down parka.

      through the front door carrying his sack of cash.  Avis looks up.
