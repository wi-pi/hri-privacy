I'm not sure whether my financial accounts will allow me to buy a restaurant though. I have investments with Robinhood and Goldman Sachs, but these stocks are slow growing. The earnings statements are cash-flow positive, and the company's assets far outweigh their liabilities. The share price isn't overpriced, so I will buy the initial public offering at $24.67 per share. This investment will net me 20 million by the end of the fiscal year.
